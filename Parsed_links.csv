https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-iaea-zarif-tehran-c3a8afc699c670300b9521f1e2019ef7,"Iranconfirmed Wednesday that thenext round of nuclear talks with the United States this weekendwill be held in Rome after earlier confusion over where the negotiations would be held.

The announcement by Iranian state television came as Iran‚Äôs PresidentMasoud Pezeshkianformally approved the resignation of one of his vice presidents who served as Tehran‚Äôs key negotiator in its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

The head of the United Nations‚Äô nuclear watchdog, Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency, also arrived in the Islamic Republic on Wednesday. His talks may includenegotiations over just what access the IAEA inspectors can getunder any proposed deal.

The state TV announcement said Oman will again mediate the talks on Saturday in Rome. Oman‚Äôs foreign minister served as an interlocutor between the two sides at talks last weekend in Muscat, the sultanate‚Äôs capital.

Officials initially on Monday identified Rome as hosting the negotiations, only forIran to insist early Tuesday they would return to Oman. American officials so far haven‚Äôt said publicly where the talks will be held, though Trump did callOman‚Äôs Sultan Haitham bin Tariqon Tuesday, while the ruler was on a trip to the Netherlands.

The stakes of the negotiations couldn‚Äôt be higher for the two nationsclosing in on half a century of enmity. U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly has threatenedto unleash airstrikestargeting Iran‚Äôs nuclear program if a deal isn‚Äôt reached. Iranian officialsincreasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weaponwith their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.


The former vice president, Mohammad Javad Zarif, served as a key supporter of Pezeshkian in his election last year but drew criticism from hard-liners within Iran‚Äôs Shiite theocracy, who long have alleged Zarif gave away too much in negotiations.

In March,Zarif tendered his resignation to Pezeshkian. However, the president did not immediately respond to the letter. Zarif hasused resignation announcements in the pastin his political career as leverage, including in a dispute last year over the composition of Pezeshkian‚Äôs Cabinet. The president had rejected that resignation.

But on late Tuesday, a statement from the presidency said Pezeshkian wrote Zarif a letter praising him but accepting his resignation.

‚ÄúPezeshkian emphasized that due to certain issues, his administration can no longer benefit from Zarif‚Äôs valuable knowledge and expertise,‚Äù a statement from the presidency said.

The president in a decree appointed Mohsen Ismaili, 59, to be his new vice president for strategic affairs. In Iran‚Äôs political system, the president has multiple vice presidents. Ismaili is known as a political moderate and a legal expert.

Grossi arrived in Tehran for meetings with Pezeshkian and others. He met Wednesday night with Iran‚Äôs Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on the social platform X after the meeting: ‚ÄúCooperation with (the IAEA) is indispensable to provide credible assurances about the peaceful nature of Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme at a time when diplomacy is urgently needed.‚Äù

Iran‚Äôs state-run IRNA news agency described Araghchi as briefing Grossi on the first round of talks with the U.S., while also urging the IAEA to ‚Äúadopt a clear and transparent stance regarding threats against Iran‚Äôs peaceful nuclear facilities.‚Äù Both Israel and the U.S. have threatened to attack Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites if a deal can‚Äôt be reached to limit Tehran‚Äôs program.

‚ÄúAs variety of spoilers are gathered to derail current negotiations, we need a Director General of Peace,‚Äù Araghchi wrote on X. ‚ÄúOur predisposition is to trust Grossi in mission to keep the Agency away from politics and politicization, and to retain focus on its technical mandate.‚Äù

Since the nuclear deal‚Äôs collapse in 2018 with Trump‚Äôs unilateral withdraw of the U.S. from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its program, and enriches uranium to up to 60% purity ‚Äî near weapons-grade levels of 90%.

Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of theVienna-based agency‚Äôs most experienced inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that they could pursue atomic weapons, something the West and the IAEA have been worried about for years since Tehran abandoned an organized weapons program in 2003.

Any possible deal between Iran and the U.S. likely would need to rely on the IAEA‚Äôs expertise to ensure Tehran‚Äôs compliance. And despite tensions between Iran and the agency, its access has not been entirely revoked.

Meanwhile, Araghchi on Wednesday warned the U.S. about taking contradictory stances in the talks.

That likely refers to comments from U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who this week initially suggested a deal could see Iran go back to 3.67% uranium enrichment ‚Äî like in the 2015 deal reached by the Obama administration. Witkoff then followed up with saying ‚Äúa deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.‚Äù

‚ÄúIran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,‚Äù he wrote on X. ‚ÄúIt is imperative for the world that we create a tough, fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.‚Äù

Araghchi warned America about taking any ‚Äúcontradictory and opposing stances‚Äù in the talks.

‚ÄúWhat is certain is that Iran‚Äôs enrichment (program) is a real, accepted matter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are prepared to build trust and address any potential concerns, but the core issue of enrichment itself is not negotiable.‚Äù

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7pqzk47zo,"## Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman

Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.

It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales.

The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.

Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.

Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words ""woman"" and ""sex"" are defined in the legislation.

He told the court: ""The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.

""But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.""

He added that the legislation gives transgender people ""protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender"".

Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears.

The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.

The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.

For Women Scotland argued for a ""common sense"" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an ""immutable biological state"".

Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: ""Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex.

""Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling.""

First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement.

Heposted on social media: ""The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster.

""We will now engage on the implications of the ruling.""

Swinney added: ""Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.""

A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted ""in good faith"" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.

A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring ""clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs"".

""Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,"" the spokesman added.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenochdescribed the rulingas a ""victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious"".

She added: ""It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.""

The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy overtransgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prisonand an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse whoobjected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room.


The judges ruled that interpreting sex as ""certificated"" rather than ""biological"" would ""cut across the definitions of man and ""woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way"".

They said a ""certified"" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian.

The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to ""function coherently"".

It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions.

The judges noted ""similar confusion and impracticability"" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces.

The judges added: ""The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.""


Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender.

However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs ""if it is proportionate to do so"".

Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman.

He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex.

But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be ""settled"" by this court case.

He told the BBC: ""It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.""

Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a ""reassessment"" of rules.

The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards.

For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law.

The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts.

Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was ""not limited to biological or birth sex"".

The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex.

The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-850289,"Israel shifts Gaza aid to private sector, backtracks on Gaza aid provision, Katz confirms 

Defense Minister Israel Katzon Wednesday confirmed that Israel is close to backtracking on a vow not to allow the provision of more humanitarian aid to Gaza before the Israeli hostages are returned and that aid could be restarted soon, though private companies would be used to circumvent Hamas. 
Katz‚Äôs admission follows a flurry of leaks in recent weeks that Israel would need to restore the flow of aid to Gaza soon if no new ceasefire deal is reached, given that it has been cut off for around six weeks.
Israel had initially said it would permanently cut off aid and that there were no international law questions at stake, given the excess food that Hamashad obtained during the 40-day-plus ceasefire from January 19 to early March. The defense minister‚Äôs statement acknowledged the reality that without restoring aid soon, Israel could run into new questions of alleged starvation. In contrast, if it restores aid soon, given that many estimates said that Hamas had enough food for at least around three months, the IDF could avoid new claims of attempted starvation by Israel against the Gazan population.

However, Katz‚Äôs statement left many questions unclear. While he referenced private companies for handing out food to Gaza‚Äôs population, which he said would sideline Hamas as the party distributing food aid, he did not provide names or details. 
This is not the first time that Israel has tried to cut Hamas out of the food aid distribution chain. 
As early as January 2024, then-defense minister Yoav Gallant tried to initiate such a program in northern Gaza for the direct provision of food to Palestinian civilians without Hamas‚Äôs intervention, but the program was never workable and faced pushback within the government from hard-right ministers Betzalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir.
Eventually, Israel tried to use the World Food Program and the World Central Kitchen to replace UNRWA for handing out aid, but each organization, at one point or another, withdrew due to being mistakenly struck by IDF forces. 
Even when the organizations returned, they either distributed the food directly to Hamas, or the terror group seized it from whoever it was given to. It is unclear how private contractors would have large enough and powerful enough armed forces to distribute food aid to over two million Palestinians throughout Gaza on a daily basis and would be able to stay in the field long enough to ensure that Hamas did not take it at some point.
Seemingly to try to dilute the admission and preempt attacks from Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, Katz buried the food aid admission in a longer statement about crushing Hamas, regaining all of the hostages, and threatening a wider war. Likewise, Katz claimed that Egypt is pressuring Hamas to give up its weapons, though the terror group has made it clear that such a condition is a non-starter. According to Israeli intelligence, Hamas has also rebuilt and is back up to 20,000-25,000 fighters.
IDF sources said there is still no concrete plan to engage new private contractors to distribute food aid to Gaza. Ben-Gvir responded to Katz‚Äôs statement in a post on X/Twitter, noting, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame that we don‚Äôt learn from mistakes.‚Äù
‚ÄúAs long as our hostages are languishing in the tunnels, there is no reason for a single grain of food or any aid to enter Gaza. Halting the aid is one of the central pressure points on Hamas, and returning it before Hamas is on its knees and has released all our hostages would be a historic mistake.
‚ÄúI will do everything in my power to ensure that this historic mistake does not happen, and I call on the prime minister and the defense minister not to take this foolish step, which would harm our ability to defeat Hamas and safely bring all our hostages home,‚Äù Ben-Gvir wrote.

Following Ben-Gvir‚Äôs latest criticism of Katz for acknowledging that food aid to Gaza may resume in the future, the defense minister released a bizarre statement in which he said repeatedly that food aid would not be restored at this time, but contrastingly that it would be restored in the future.

The IDF does need some work



","Israel shifts Gaza aid to private sector, backtracks on Gaza aid provision, Katz confirms",,The Jerusalem Post,03/13/2024
https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-04-16-2025-884713e2096d5353e3008ec7d9cc01ab,"Israel‚Äôs defense minister said on Wednesday that troops will remain in so-called security zones in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely, remarks that could further complicate talks with Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage release. Israel says it must maintain control of what it refers to as security zones to prevent a repeat of Hamas‚Äô Oct. 7, 2023, attack. The Palestinians and both neighboring countries view the presence of Israeli troops as military occupation in violation of international law.

Meanwhile, Israeli strikes across Gaza killed another 22 people, according to local health officials, including a girl who was not yet a year old. The girl‚Äôs mother, who was wounded, embraced her daughter, still wearing a bloodied blue dress, before she was taken for burial.

Israeli forces have taken over more than half of Gaza in a renewed campaign to pressure Hamas militants to release hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire last month. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria after rebels overthrew Syrian President Bashar Assad in December.

‚ÄúUnlike in the past, the (Israeli military) is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized,‚Äù Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. The military ‚Äúwill remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and (Israeli) communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza ‚Äî as in Lebanon and Syria.‚Äù

The Palestinians and both neighboring countries view the presence of Israeli troops as military occupation in violation of international law.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports displaced Palestinians have been told to leave shelters in the West Bank; many have nowhere to go.

Lebanese president Joseph Aoun said that Israel‚Äôs continued presence in some areas in Lebanon was ‚Äúhindering‚Äù the Lebanese army‚Äôs full deployment as required by the ceasefire negotiated with Israel.

Two Israeli drone strikes on Wednesday in southern Lebanon killed two people, the health ministry said. The U.N. said Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 70 civilians since the ceasefire took effect in November.

Hamas has said it will not release dozens of remaining hostages without a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire.

‚ÄúThey promised that the hostages come first. In practice, Israel is choosing to seize territory before the hostages,‚Äù the main organization representing families of the hostages said in a statement. ‚ÄúThere is one solution that is desirable and feasible, and that is the release of all the hostages at once as part of an agreement, even at the cost of ending the war.‚Äù

Israel says it must maintain control of what it refers to as security zones to prevent a repeat of Hamas‚Äô Oct. 7, 2023, attack in which thousands of militants stormed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251.

Israel‚Äôs offensive has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza‚Äôs Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says women and children make up more than half of the dead. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. 

## ‚ÄòEvery day, children‚Äô

Ahlam Seiam‚Äôs family had planned to celebrate her first birthday later this month. Then the Israeli strike hit the building where they had pitched a tent on the roof.

Her grandfather, Nashat, said the family was awakened by a blast overnight. When he raced to the roof, he found his son, Mohammed, sobbing.

‚ÄúI found her like this,‚Äù he said as he held the girl‚Äôs body.

Associated Press footage showed the mother, wrapped in bandages, cradling her daughter one last time in the hospital bed.

Israel says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas. The grandfather said there were no militants in the area of the strike. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.

The family had fled to Khan Younis from the southern city of Rafah after Israel renewed its offensive last month. ‚ÄúWherever you go, death will catch up with you. There is no escape,‚Äù the grandfather said.

Nermin Zughrub, Ahlam‚Äôs aunt, scrolled through photos of the girl on her phone.

‚ÄúIf the world doesn‚Äôt wake up today, when will it?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEvery day, massacres. Every day, children.‚Äù

## Much of Gaza is uninhabitable

Israel‚Äôs bombardment and ground operations have left vast areas of the territory uninhabitable and have displaced around 90% of the population of roughly 2 million Palestinians. Many have been displaced multiple times.

Hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps with dwindling food as an aid blockade in Gaza imposed by Israel entered its seventh week. The U.N. humanitarian office, or OCHA, said Wednesday that humanitarian workers on the ground are reporting a rise in acute malnutrition across the Gaza Strip.

Water has become increasingly scarce, with Palestinians desperately lining up in front of water trucks clutching containers and jerrycans. Omar Shatat, deputy director of Gaza‚Äôs Coastal Water Utility, told The Associated Press that each person gets six to seven liters of potable water each day, calling it a ‚Äúwater catastrophe.‚Äù

‚ÄùWater, it‚Äôs the simplest thing,‚Äù said Nevin Al-Dahloul, a displaced woman from Beit Lahiya. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for luxury, it‚Äôs our most basic right.‚Äù

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to annihilate Hamas and return the 59 hostages still in Gaza ‚Äî 24 of whom are believed to still be alive.

On Wednesday, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group released a video of hostage Rom Braslavski. It was the first sign of life of him, though recently released hostages had said they had seen him in captivity. In the video, which was filmed under duress, Braslavski says he was held in terrible conditions and pleads with Netanyahu to stop the war and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Netanyahu also has said that Israel will implement U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal for the resettlement of much of Gaza‚Äôs population in other countries through what Netanyahu refers to as ‚Äúvoluntary emigration.‚Äù


Palestinians and Arab countries have universally rejected Trump‚Äôs proposal, which human rights experts say would likely violate international law. Palestinians in Gaza say they don‚Äôt want to leave, and fear another mass expulsion like the one that occurred during the war surrounding Israel‚Äôs creation in 1948.

The Trump administration, which took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire, has expressed full support for Israel‚Äôs decision to end the truce and to cut off aid. Trump‚Äôs Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been trying to broker a new ceasefire, more favorable to Israel, but those efforts appear to have made little progress.

Netanyahu leads the most nationalist and religious government in Israel‚Äôs history, and his coalition partners have called for the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza.
