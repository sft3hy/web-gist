It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales. The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people. Five key takeaways from Supreme Court ruling Women's campaigners celebrate court win - but what will it change? The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women. The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words "woman" and "sex" are defined in the legislation. He told the court: "The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. "But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not." He added that the legislation gives transgender people "protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender". EPA The Supreme Court case follows years of legal arguments over the definition of a woman under the law Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears. The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including "sex" and "gender reassignment". Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by "sex" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, "certificated" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex "for all purposes". For Women Scotland argued for a "common sense" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an "immutable biological state". EPA Campaigners gathered outside the Supreme Court for the verdict Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: "Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex. "Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling." First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement. He posted on social media : "The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster. "We will now engage on the implications of the ruling." Swinney added: "Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions." A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted "in good faith" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement. A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring "clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs". "Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government," the spokesman added. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the ruling as a "victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious". She added: "It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so." 'Deep concern' Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: "It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK." But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: "This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society. "It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next." Getty Images Author JK Rowling has been a vocal supporter of For Women Scotland's case For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups. Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender. Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was "shocked" by the court ruling, arguing that it "reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates". They added: "This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services. "It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody." The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy over transgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prison and an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse who objected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room . NHS Fife said it would "carefully consider" the court's judgement. 'Biological' or 'certified'? The judges ruled that interpreting sex as "certificated" rather than "biological" would "cut across the definitions of man and "woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way". They said a "certified" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian. The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to "function coherently". It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions. The judges noted "similar confusion and impracticability" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces. The judges added: "The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct." PA Media The legal case has come at a time of heated debate on gender issues Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender. However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs "if it is proportionate to do so". Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman. He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex. But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be "settled" by this court case. He told the BBC: "It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them." Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a "reassessment" of rules. How did we get here? The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards. For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law. The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts. Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was "not limited to biological or birth sex". The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex. The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers. What is at stake in the Supreme Court gender case?

By YONAH JEREMY BOB APRIL 16, 2025 10:59 Updated: APRIL 16, 2025 21:00 Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz over a background of humanitarian trucks entering the Gaza Strip; Illustrative (photo credit: Amir Levy/Getty Images, FLASH90/CHAIM GOLDBERG) Defense Minister Israel Katz on Wednesday confirmed that Israel is close to backtracking on a vow not to allow the provision of more humanitarian aid to Gaza before the Israeli hostages are returned and that aid could be restarted soon, though private companies would be used to circumvent Hamas. Katz’s admission follows a flurry of leaks in recent weeks that Israel would need to restore the flow of aid to Gaza soon if no new ceasefire deal is reached, given that it has been cut off for around six weeks. Israel had initially said it would permanently cut off aid and that there were no international law questions at stake, given the excess food that Hamas had obtained during the 40-day-plus ceasefire from January 19 to early March. The defense minister’s statement acknowledged the reality that without restoring aid soon, Israel could run into new questions of alleged starvation. In contrast, if it restores aid soon, given that many estimates said that Hamas had enough food for at least around three months, the IDF could avoid new claims of attempted starvation by Israel against the Gazan population. Trucks containing humanitarian aid from Jordan and international communities transfers into the northern Gaza Strip, October 22, 2024 (credit: IDF SPOKESMAN’S UNIT) However, Katz’s statement left many questions unclear. While he referenced private companies for handing out food to Gaza’s population, which he said would sideline Hamas as the party distributing food aid, he did not provide names or details. This is not the first time that Israel has tried to cut Hamas out of the food aid distribution chain. As early as January 2024, then-defense minister Yoav Gallant tried to initiate such a program in northern Gaza for the direct provision of food to Palestinian civilians without Hamas’s intervention, but the program was never workable and faced pushback within the government from hard-right ministers Betzalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir . Eventually, Israel tried to use the World Food Program and the World Central Kitchen to replace UNRWA for handing out aid, but each organization, at one point or another, withdrew due to being mistakenly struck by IDF forces. Even when the organizations returned, they either distributed the food directly to Hamas, or the terror group seized it from whoever it was given to. It is unclear how private contractors would have large enough and powerful enough armed forces to distribute food aid to over two million Palestinians throughout Gaza on a daily basis and would be able to stay in the field long enough to ensure that Hamas did not take it at some point. Burying food aid admission Seemingly to try to dilute the admission and preempt attacks from Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, Katz buried the food aid admission in a longer statement about crushing Hamas, regaining all of the hostages, and threatening a wider war. Likewise, Katz claimed that Egypt is pressuring Hamas to give up its weapons, though the terror group has made it clear that such a condition is a non-starter. According to Israeli intelligence, Hamas has also rebuilt and is back up to 20,000-25,000 fighters. IDF sources said there is still no concrete plan to engage new private contractors to distribute food aid to Gaza. Ben-Gvir responded to Katz’s statement in a post on X/Twitter, noting, “It’s a shame that we don’t learn from mistakes.” “As long as our hostages are languishing in the tunnels, there is no reason for a single grain of food or any aid to enter Gaza. Halting the aid is one of the central pressure points on Hamas, and returning it before Hamas is on its knees and has released all our hostages would be a historic mistake. “I will do everything in my power to ensure that this historic mistake does not happen, and I call on the prime minister and the defense minister not to take this foolish step, which would harm our ability to defeat Hamas and safely bring all our hostages home,” Ben-Gvir wrote. Following Ben-Gvir’s latest criticism of Katz for acknowledging that food aid to Gaza may resume in the future, the defense minister released a bizarre statement in which he said repeatedly that food aid would not be restored at this time, but contrastingly that it would be restored in the future.

The police's special investigation team on Yoon's Dec. 3 martial law declaration searched the presidential office's secure phone server and the PSS office and residence, all in the central Seoul district of Yongsan, in the morning, police officials said. Kim is accused of obstructing investigators' attempt to detain Yoon at the presidential residence in January. Last month, a Seoul court turned down the prosecution's request for warrants to arrest Kim and Lee Kwang-woo, chief of the PSS' bodyguard division. Police officials said the presidential office's surveillance cameras are also subject to the raid in connection with former Interior Minister Lee Sang-min's insurrection charges.

Mcebisi Jonas is former deputy finance minister and also served as investment envoy in 2018. In 2016, he accused the government of Jacob Zuma, back then president of South Africa, of corruption, saying that the Gupta family had offered to bribe him for the position of finance minister. The move to appoint him as special envoy to the US comes as relations between Washington and Pretoria are at their lowest point in years. The situation rapidly deteriorated earlier this year when US president Donald Trump cut off US foreign assistance to South Africa. And in late March, South African ambassador to the US Ebrahim Rasool was declared a persona non grata and expelled from American territory over critical remarks he made on the subject of the Trump administration. In his statement announcing the appointment of the special US envoy, president Ramaphosa however noted that he remained "committed to rebuilding and maintaining" the relationship with Washington. "Mr Jonas is entrusted with the responsibility to advance South Africa's diplomatic, trade and bilateral priorities", noted the presidency.

"The Oman talks are one of dozens of tasks for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs," the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said in his meeting with a group of high-ranking officials from three branches of the Iranian government on Tuesday. The Leader of the Islamic Revolution also said that the country's issues must not be tied to the talks. "We are neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic about these talks," Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said while referring to the first round of indirect negotiations between Tehran and Washington in Oman on Saturday. After all, it is a decision and a move that has been made and has been implemented well in the first steps, the Leader noted. He continued, "Of course, we are very pessimistic about the other side, but we are optimistic about our own abilities." Recalling the mistakes made during the JCPOA agreement in 2015, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said, "The mistake we made in the JCPOA should not be repeated." "During the JCPOA, we conditioned the country and made everything dependent on the progress of the negotiations," he said. "Investors will not invest when they see that the country is dependent on negotiation," he underlined. “The negotiations may or may not yield results. We are neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic about them. Of course, we are very skeptical of the other party, but confident in our own capabilities,” the Leader said. “The removal of the sanctions is not in our hands, but neutralizing them is; there are many ways and [there is] great domestic capacity to do that. If this objective is achieved, the country will become impervious to sanctions,” the Leader said. Ayatollah Khamenei said the first steps in the current talks with the United States have proceeded satisfactorily. He urged officials to continue the negotiations with similar care hereafter. The remarks came after Iran and the US held talks in the Omani capital last Saturday, with Oman's foreign minister functioning as the mediator, according to Press TV. The Islamic Republic has asserted that the talks were solely aimed at addressing the US’s illegal and unilateral sanctions against the country, and various aspects of the Iranian nuclear energy program, strongly rejecting speculation about the process’s involving other issues. The United States lifted some of the sanctions as per the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a historical 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers. Washington, however, returned the bans three years after conclusion of the deal, and even began piling up more coercive measures on the Islamic Republic. The US has termed the adversarial approach as “maximum pressure,” which has also seen American officials’ repeatedly threatening to use military force against the Iranian soil. The Islamic Republic has, meanwhile, underscored that any direct negotiations with the US were neither useful nor acceptable for Tehran as long as Washington retained its hostile policies.

The Lebanese government has made a decision that "weapons will only be in the hands of the state," but there are "discussions around how to implement this decision," Aoun said in an interview with Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera. Those discussions are in the form of a "bilateral dialogue" between the presidency and Hezbollah, he said. Lebanon has been under pressure by the United States to speed up the disarmament of Hezbollah but there are fears within Lebanon that forcing the issue could lead to civil conflict. "Civil peace is a red line for me," Aoun said. Aoun said the Lebanese army — of which he was formerly commander — is "doing its duty" in confiscating weapons and dismantling unauthorized military facilities in southern Lebanon, as outlined in the ceasefire agreement that ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in late November, and sometimes in areas farther north. in Syria.

The Harbin public security bureau said that the three operatives -- Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson -- had been engaged in cyberattacks targeting the Asian Winter Games held in the city in February. Investigations by Chinese technical teams revealed that the cyberattacks were carried out by the Office of Tailored Access Operations of the NSA. To conceal the origins of its attacks and secure its cyber weapons, the office used multiple affiliated front organizations to purchase IP addresses from various countries and anonymously rented servers located in regions including Europe and Asia. Investigations revealed that the NSA focused its pre-event cyberattacks on critical systems of the Asian Winter Games, including registration, arrival/departure management, and competition entry platforms, authorities said. These systems, essential for pre-event operations, stored vast amounts of sensitive personal data of individuals associated with the Games. From Feb 3, coinciding with the first ice hockey match, NSA cyberattacks peaked, primarily targeting critical operational systems such as the event's official information platforms. These systems were vital for ensuring the smooth running of the Games, and the NSA attempted to disrupt them to undermine their normal operations. Meanwhile, the NSA launched cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in Heilongjiang province, including energy, transportation, water resources, telecommunications, and defense research institutions, authorities said. Technical teams also discovered that during the Asian Winter Games, the NSA transmitted unknown encrypted data packets to specific devices running Microsoft Windows operating systems within the province. These packets are suspected to have been attempts to activate or trigger pre-implanted backdoors in the Windows systems, authorities added. Further investigations revealed that the three NSA operatives had repeatedly launched cyberattacks against China's critical information infrastructure and participated in cyber operations targeting companies such as Huawei. Technical teams also uncovered evidence implicating the University of California and Virginia Tech in the coordinated cyber campaign against the Asian Winter Games, authorities stated.

https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/new-armed-extremist-group-claims-responsibility-bombing-greeces-120770871: ABC News Video Live Shows Shop Log In Stream on Armed extremist group claims responsibility for bombing near Greece rail headquarters A new extremist group has claimed responsibility for a bomb that exploded near the offices of Hellenic Train, Greece’s main railway services operator, and the planting of another near the Labor Ministry in early February By DEMETRIS NELLAS Associated Press April 13, 2025, 4:33 PM 1:11 The logo of Hellenic Train, Greece's main railway company, is seen outside company's headquarters, following a bomb explosion Friday night causing causing limited damage but no injuries, in Athens, Greece, on Saturday, April 12, 2025. (AP Photo/Yorgos Karahalis) The Associated Press ATHENS, Greece -- A new extremist group claimed responsibility Sunday for a bomb that exploded near the offices of Hellenic Train, Greece’s main railway services operator and the planting of another near the Labor Ministry in early February. The explosion Friday evening resulted in limited damage and no injuries. The perpetrators had forewarned of the explosion by calling two media organizations about 40 minutes before it happened. In a lengthy posting on the website Athens.indymedia.org on Sunday, the perpetrators, who styled themselves the Revolutionary Class Struggle, explained the reasons for their action, which they said was part of an armed struggle against the state. Revolutionary Class Struggle dedicated the bombings to “the Palestinian people and their heroic resistance” and paid tribute to Kyriakos Xymitiris, a man who was killed last year when the explosive device he was assembling exploded in a central Athens apartment. The explosion also came during widespread public anger over a 2023 railway disaster, Greece’s worst, in which 57 people were killed and dozens more injured when a freight train and a passenger train heading in opposite directions were accidentally put on the same track. The deadly accident exposed severe deficiencies in Greece’s railway system, including in safety systems, and has triggered mass protests led by relatives of the victims against the country’s conservative government on the occasion of the accident’s second anniversary. In its statement, which serves as a sort of manifesto, Revolutionary Class Struggle connects the accident with what it called the “murders” of the proletariat in the form of workplace accidents, by capitalists. Greece has a long history of politically motivated violence dating back to the 1970s, with domestic extremist groups carrying out small-scale bombings that usually cause damage but rarely lead to injuries. While the groups most active in the 1980s and 1990s have been dismantled, new smaller groups have emerged. Authorities are calling them a new generation of domestic extremists. “With the blood not yet dry, they attributed the (train) accident to human error and the ‘chronic deficiencies of the Greek state,’ in effect demanding even more freedom of movement for capital, more privatizations and new attacks on any remaining state-owned infrastructure,” the extremist group said. Hellenic Train, the operator of passenger and cargo train services, was once a subsidiary of state-owned Hellenic Railways. It was split and sold to Italy’s Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane in 2017. Hellenic Railways retains ownership and responsibility for the maintenance of the rail infrastructure, including the train stations. Police say they are following leads, including images of one or two individuals on security cameras and possible cellphone conversations.

ADVERTISEMENT European leaders took to social media on Sunday to condemn Russia's latest deadly attack on the Ukrainian city of Sumy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote that "Russian cruelty struck again," calling the attack "barbaric" in a post on X. More than 30 people were killed in the missile strike as people gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, according to officials. Images from the scene showed lines of black body bags lying on the side of the road, while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris. Video footage also showed fire crews as they fought to extinguish the shells of burned-out cars among the rubble from damaged buildings. A further 99 people were injured, including 11 children, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. Von der Leyen added that "Russia was and remains the aggressor, in blatant violation of international law." The attack on Sumy is the second large-scale attack to claim such a high number of civilian lives in just over a week. A deadly missile strike on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih on 4 April killed some 20 people, including nine children. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said that the Sumy attack crossed “any line of decency” and that the White House remained committed to ending the conflict. “There are scores of civilian dead and wounded. As a former military leader, I understand targeting and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war," he said. Zelenskyy also called for a global response to the attack. “Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs. What’s needed is an attitude toward Russia that a terrorist deserves,” he said. EU Foreign Chief Kaja Kallas also condemned the attack on social media, writing of a "horrific example of Russia intensifying attacks while Ukraine has accepted an unconditional ceasefire." French President Emmanuel Macron said that the strike undermined Washington-led peace talks between the two sides. “Everyone knows: This war was initiated by Russia alone. And today, it is clear that Russia alone chooses to continue it — with blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump,” he wrote in a statement. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was "appalled at Russia's horrific attacks on civilians." The strikes come a day after Russia and Ukraine’s senior diplomats accused each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the three-year war. Russian forces hold the advantage in Ukraine, and Kyiv has warned Moscow is planning a fresh spring offensive to ramp up pressure on its foe and improve its negotiating position. ADVERTISEMENT Ukraine has endorsed a broader US ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/04/13/2003835086: Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorial & Opinion Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Search Search All Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorial & Opinion Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages GO Home Front Page Sun, Apr 13, 2025 page1 CPC to boost LNG imports to narrow trade balance By Liu Ching-hua and Jake Chung / Staff reporter, with staff writer State-owned oil refiner CPC Corp, Taiwan (CPC, 台灣中油) plans to boost its procurement of US energy products — including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil — in response to US President Donald Trump’s 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese exports, sources said yesterday. President William Lai (賴清德) has said the government intends to expand purchases of US goods, including agricultural, industrial, and energy products, as part of its strategy to narrow the trade balance. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said it aims for US-sourced LNG to account for 30 percent of Taiwan’s total LNG imports. Electricity pylons in Taipei are pictured in an undated photograph. Photo: Lin Cheng-kun, Taipei Times Last year, US LNG made up 10 percent of CPC’s imports, with the company sourcing from 14 different countries, the ministry said. CPC sources said the target could be met by ramping up existing LNG imports from the US or seeking new supply channels, such as LNG from Alaska. The company said it has inked a term sheet with select US firms certifying its intent to import LNG from Alaska, although the project could take five to seven years to come online. The company said that major US energy firms maintain diversified global investments and that it has an understanding with its partners to adjust delivery volumes based on demand and evolving circumstances. It also said it confirmed it would significantly increase LNG imports from the US over the next four years. It also plans to raise its purchases of US crude oil to help ensure a stable energy supply for the country. The company said it primarily imports sweet crude oil, or crude with a lower sulfur content, from the US and African countries, adding that sweet crude, while more expensive, was more environmentally friendly. It is also importing sour crude, or crude with higher sulfur content, from the Middle East, it added. While the company had been considering scaling back US sweet crude imports due to declining domestic demand for gasoline and diesel, it is now reassessing that decision in light of the government’s push for net-zero emissions and broader energy diversification policies. US-sourced crude has already increased from 44 percent to 60 percent of CPC’s total imports over the past three years. The rise was partly due to a fire at the company’s Dalin refinery’s heavy oil desulfurization unit on Oct. 27, 2022. The Dalin facility has since been repaired and is expected to resume operations shortly, CPC said.

https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2025-04-12/eu-joint-defense-fund/: Skip to content Menu Menu Products Media Companies Companies and Institutions News Thematic Websites EFE Salud EFE Verde efeminista Euro EFE Contact About us Newsletters English Spanish Portuguese Latvian Finance Minister Arvils Aseradens, Italian Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, and Cypriot Finance Minister Iakovos Keravnos attend the second day of the informal meeting of EU economic and financial ministers and central bank governors (ECOFIN) meeting organized as part of the Polish presidency of the Council of the European Union at the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw, Poland, 12 April, 2025. EFE-EPA/RADEK PIETRUSZKA POLAND OUT Spain pushes for EU defense fund to accelerate joint military projects 12 April 2025 12 April 2025 by Agencia EFE Warsaw, Apr 12 (EFE).— Spain on Saturday proposed the creation of a new European financial instrument to fast-track large-scale defense projects, aiming to reduce EU reliance on US military support and respond swiftly to mounting security challenges. The plan, presented during an informal meeting of EU finance ministers in Warsaw, would also allow non-EU countries to participate, aiming to boost European defense spending in the short term. Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo outlined the proposal as a way to strengthen the EU’s autonomy in defense, particularly in light of the United States’ shifting stance under President Donald Trump regarding Ukraine and NATO contributions. “The proposal aims not only to increase defense spending immediately but also to use resources more efficiently by coordinating Europe’s security needs,” Cuerpo said. He described the fund as a “transitional solution” to expedite defense investments until more permanent financing, such as incorporating defense into the EU’s long-term budget, is in place. A Swift, Temporary Mechanism The proposed instrument would take the form of a temporary special-purpose entity, open not only to EU member states. It would be funded through voluntary contributions from participating countries, with the exact formula for contributions yet to be determined. The fund would support grants and loans for large-scale defense projects, complementing other EU financing sources, such as common debt issuance under existing or new programs. The Spanish Ministry of Economy also suggested tapping into the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone’s rescue fund with €400 billion in lending capacity, and leveraging the windfall earnings from around €200 billion in frozen Russian assets held in the EU. Spain argues that this new instrument could be established more quickly than long-term solutions like increasing the EU’s multi-annual financial framework, another proposal Madrid supports but acknowledges would take years to implement. “This is the moment for European solidarity…to support Ukraine and frontline Eastern nations. We must invest together in defense, which is a genuine European public good that benefits our citizens and strengthens our economic security,” Cuerpo said. Backing From Brussels and Beyond Spain’s initiative complements the European Commission’s proposed rearmament strategy, which includes loosening fiscal rules to boost defense spending, potentially mobilizing €650 billion over four years, and a €150 billion loan instrument funded through common debt issuance. European Commissioner for the Economy Valdis Dombrovskis welcomed the Spanish proposal, saying the commission is “ready to explore new options.” He noted that the Spanish proposal aligns with ongoing discussions among EU member states, including recognizing defense as a European public good and addressing unequal security burdens across the bloc. “There is a clear awakening in Europe regarding security,” said Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domański, who hosted the meeting. “Many countries have shifted their stance compared to a year or two ago, and there is a stronger willingness to increase spending.” He praised the solidarity of southern EU nations with their Eastern and Central European counterparts and said a majority of member states now support finding new financing mechanisms. Domański also stressed the urgency of reaching agreement on the commission’s proposed the Security Action For Europe (SAFE) instrument by May, and encouraged EU countries to request flexibility in fiscal rules by the end of April so that adjustments can be approved by July and enable higher defense spending.

In Russian Regions, Recruiting For Ukraine War Soars April 12, 2025 11:05 CET By RFE/RL's Siberia.Realities Russian enlistees gather inside a military recruitment center in the Rostov-on-Don. (file photo) Share 'They're Taking Everyone.' In Russian Regions, Recruiting For Ukraine War Soars share Print Russian recruitment for men to fight in Ukraine is soaring in many of the country's regions, with signing bonuses and other incentives reaching new records in some places. In Siberian regions like Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, local authorities have aggressively pushed contracts on potential volunteers, and signing bonuses in some places exceed average annual salaries, according to recruits and official advertising campaigns. Sergei, who asked that his real name not be used and that his specific town in the Irkutsk region not be disclosed, said that, when he showed up at a recruiting office, he was immediately shown into a room and handed a brochure with "big, red figure" on the front: 1.4 million rubles ($16,700). "It's supposedly what they’re paying you to go die. Or kill. Depends how it turns out, I guess," he told RFE/RL's Siberia Realities. Russian officials have not released casualty figures since 2022, but Western estimates put the number of Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the all-out invasion in February 2022 at more than 790,000. The bulk of those casualties have occurred as a result of the battlefield tactics that Russian commanders have relied on: front infantry assaults, sometimes on foot, sometimes on motorcycles, that seek to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses. Extraordinarily High Wages And Benefits To replenish personnel, authorities have relied heavily on extraordinarily high wages and benefits to attract volunteers to fight in Ukraine. The signing bonuses typically are a mix of federal and local payments. SEE ALSO: For Some In Russia's Far-Flung Provinces, Ukraine War Is A Ticket To Prosperity Authorities in Moscow have also pressured regional leaders to meet quotas for new volunteers. In Iskitim, a town near the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, a woman who asked to be called Galina said she visited her local recruiting office on behalf of her nephew, who had previously been rejected for medical reasons. She said the recruiter pushed her to bring him to the enlistment office -- not just pass along the brochures to him. “I told her I’d think about it,” she said. “They’re taking everyone.” 'You Could Die In Your First Week' She said officials are offering 1.2 million ruble signing bonuses ($14,300), but they're also highlighting a monthly salary for fighting in the war: starting at 210,000 rubles ($2,500). "Then they keep adding numbers, trying to make it sound as good as it did in late 2024," she said. "Never mind that you could die in your first week." Galina said there were two other men at the recruiting on the day she visited recently. One was seeking a "missing-in-action" certification for a relative, the other wanted a death certificate for his 24-year-old son, so he could claim death benefits, but he didn't have the proper proof. SEE ALSO: Russia Seeks To Fill Ranks With Raids And 'Comfortable Waiting Rooms' "He told me, ‘Of course we’re sad about our boy. He didn’t give us any grandchildren'," Galina said. "'But now we can fix up the house and buy a new car.'" "That’s how much a life is worth -- even to his own family. I don’t know, maybe he was just trying to justify what had happened. Maybe it’s the only way he could cope." Some experts have pointed to the steady increase in signing bonuses, wages, and benefits as evidence that authorities are having difficulty attracting enough recruits to keep the war going. In Yekaterinburg, a major Ural Mountain city, a woman who gave her name as Aleksandra visited a local recruiting office recently and saw a man who appeared to be close to 60 years old being referred for a medical exam. "He said they told him it would be 'just a formality,'" she said. SEE ALSO: This Is How Russia Recruits Chinese Citizens To Fight In Ukraine Her own relative, whom she did not identify, had had heart problems and was even hospitalized in a psychiatric facility not long ago. "They said it wasn’t a problem. And they reminded me about the bonus payments announced in mid-March," she said. “It felt like they had a green light to take absolutely anyone." “I asked ‘Are people really signing up?’" she told RFE/RL. The recruiter replied: "'Yes. The signings have been good, especially since they increased the payout by 2 1/2 times'.” RFE/RL's Siberia.Realities Siberia.Realities is a regional news outlet of RFE/RL's Russian Service.

(Image credit: SpaceX) NROL-192 continues a facelift of sorts for that fleet: It was the ninth launch in support of the NRO's "proliferated architecture," a new network comprised of large numbers of small, cost-efficient satellites (rather than a relative handful of highly capable but expensive craft, which has been the historical norm for the NRO). "Having hundreds of small satellites on orbit is invaluable to the NRO's mission," NRO Director Chris Scolese said in the proliferated architecture press kit, which you can find here . "They will provide greater revisit rates, increased coverage, more timely delivery of information — and ultimately help us deliver more of what our customers need even faster," he added.

Even oligarchs’ superyachts are in on it Harry Yorke , Deputy Political Editor Saturday April 05 2025, 10.00pm , The Sunday Times Russian sensors suspected of attempting to spy on the UK’s nuclear submarines have been found hidden in the seas around Britain. The discovery by the British military was deemed a potential threat to national security and has never been made public. Several were found after they washed ashore, while others are understood to have been located by the Royal Navy. The devices are believed to have been planted by Moscow to try and gather intelligence on Britain’s four Vanguard submarines, which carry nuclear missiles. One of these submarines is always at sea under what is known as the UK’s continuous at-sea deterrent. The Sunday Times has chosen to withhold certain details, including the locations of the sensors. During a three-month investigation we spoke to more than a dozen former defence ministers, senior armed forces personnel and military experts to expose how Russia is using its unrivalled underwater warfare capabilities to map, hack and potentially sabotage critical British infrastructure. Advertisement We were allowed unprecedented access to the RFA Proteus, the Royal Navy’s deep-sea surveillance vessel, to witness how it is leading efforts to counter threats in domestic waters. The investigation also found: Unmanned Russian vehicles have been discovered lurking next to deep-sea communications cables. The Ministry of Defence had credible intelligence that superyachts owned by Russian oligarchs may have been used to conduct underwater reconnaissance. The navy has discovered other sensors planted on the sea bed. The government is looking at requiring technology and energy companies to work more closely with the military and fund the protection of underwater infrastructure. Senior military figures liken the technological battle for supremacy below the waves to the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Now Britain has “woken up” to the Russian threat, the question is whether it is capable of catching up. First line of defence At 8.45am on March 21, a black inflatable speedboat is skimming across Campbeltown Loch towards one of the most secretive vessels in the Royal Navy’s fleet. The Sunday Times has joined senior naval officers being ferried to the RFA Proteus, named after the sea god in Greek mythology, as its crew spend the week training and experimenting with cutting-edge underwater vehicles. Advertisement Anchored just off Scotland’s westernmost town, the Proteus forms an imposing silhouette against the Isle of Arran, its giant helipad and deep-sea crane clearly visible from a mile away. LPHOT BILL SPURR/MOD It is the first time a journalist has been allowed to observe its capabilities since the vessel came into service in 2023. On deck, helmeted crews prepare remotely operated vehicles that later today will be lowered to the sea bed via a moon pool — an opening in the hull the size of eight snooker tables. Other, more sensitive equipment is stowed in blue metal containers. Already aboard are two dozen members of the navy’s diving and mine-hunting squadrons, experts in searching out, recovering and destroying enemy munitions on the sea bed. They are here for the first time and will become an integral part of the ship’s operations, because Britain’s critical undersea infrastructure is under unprecedented threat from a long-standing nemesis: Russia. Cat and mouse When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the might of Russia’s non-nuclear forces went with it. But according to Royal Navy insiders, Moscow never stopped investing in the submarines patrolling the murky depths of the world’s oceans. Advertisement Russia is the only nation with a fleet of specialist subs for sea-bed warfare and espionage. Some surpass the capabilities of those of Britain and its Nato allies. By the time President Putin sent tanks into Ukraine three years ago, Russia had already begun setting the stage for a much wider conflict with Nato, engaging in surveillance and sabotage of the underwater internet connections, energy pipelines and military cables that are vital to the functioning of western democracies. These activities are at the heart of Putin’s “greyzone” doctrine. The blowing up of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in 2022 was the first major incident; Royal Navy insiders maintain that its “military precision” had all the hallmarks of a Kremlin greyzone operation. In the past 15 months, at least 11 internet cables in the Baltic Sea have also been damaged, some from ships dragging anchor across the sea bed. Suspicion has come to rest on Russia’s shadow fleet of ageing tankers, which are mainly used by Putin to circumvent western oil sanctions. “You really need to keep the [engine] power on to drag, so it is a deliberate act,” a defence insider said. When a cable between Estonia and Finland was damaged in December, the Joint Expeditionary Force, a group of northern European and Baltic states led by the UK, responded by activating Nordic Warden, a reaction system that uses AI to track locations of the shadow fleet. A senior serving British military figure added: “There should be no doubt, there is a war raging in the Atlantic. This is a game of cat and mouse that has continued since the ending of the Cold War, and is now heating up again. We are seeing phenomenal amounts of Russian activity.” Advertisement The Russian underwater research programme is largely overseen by the Main Directorate for Deep-Sea Research (Gugi). Its best-known vessel is the spy ship Yantar, which gained notoriety last year when it appeared off the British coast. VITALI NEVAR/TASS It is equipped with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and two mini-submarines capable of reaching depths of 6,000m, craft that allow the Yantar to find and map infrastructure, as well as to cut cables using manipulator arms or tap them for information. In November, the Yantar was found in the Irish Sea loitering near cables carrying data for Microsoft and Google. The Proteus was one of several vessels dispatched to monitor it – or, as a defence source describes, it show Russia “they were pissing in our backyard.” When the Yantar returned to the English Channel in January, the defence secretary John Healey authorised HMS Somerset and HMS Tyne tracked it at closer range, while HMS Astute, a nuclear-powered submarine, covertly monitored the vessel from below before surfacing alongside it. RFA Proteus tracks the Yantar, left, in November MOD This more aggressive posture has been widely welcomed in the navy, with a senior official stating: “We’ve got to play by the rules of the game. But whereas before we were playing it nicely, now we’re being more muscular.” Advertisement However, the Yantar is not where the real problem lies. The waters immediately encircling Britain sit for the most part on the European continental shelf, meaning they are seldom deeper than 300m. The navy has several ways of monitoring them and is confident it can keep tabs on Russian activity. But where the continental shelf ends, the sea bed drops thousands of metres. The Proteus is the only navy surface vessel truly capable of policing these depths, where Gugi’s most potent threat, its fleet of six-nuclear powered mini-submarines, could be lurking. The mini-subs can sit on the sea bed and have manipulator arms capable of cutting cables, laying explosives or placing taps on fibreoptic cables for hacking purposes. They are supported by two larger “mother” submarines, meaning they can be moved covertly to pretty much anywhere in the world. Russia has other capabilities. Three senior defence sources have revealed that prior to the full invasion of Ukraine, there was credible intelligence that superyachts owned by oligarchs may have been used to conduct underwater reconnaissance around Britain. Several of these vessels have moon pools that can be used covertly to deploy and retrieve deep-sea reconnaissance and diving equipment. A former minister also recounted how, in 2018, HMS Albion, an amphibious assault ship, had been forced to leave port prematurely while moored in Limassol, Cyprus. The vessel had been docked for under 24 hours when a huge superyacht belonging to an oligarch pulled up alongside it. Suspecting that it was there covertly to surveil the Albion, the navy ship “moved on quite quickly.” Sea-bed warfare The Nord Stream attack highlighted the fragility of the UK’s energy supply, almost a fifth of which now comes from offshore wind farms. The electricity generated by these turbines is transported to the mainland through undersea cables. Oil and gas pipelines are also vital to Britain, particularly those ferrying gas from Norway. They could easily be severed were Russia to plant explosive devices, such as shaped charges or mines. “You cut those and you’ve lost that energy — and in the winter during high usage, that could be serious,” a senior military figure said. A second added that a co-ordinated attack could lead to a “failure of the national grid”. The 60 internet cables that connect Britain to the rest of the world are coated in plastic polyethylene and only a few inches thick. They are easily cut and most of their locations are recorded publicly. However, navy sources said the private companies operating them have laid so many that there is enough “redundancy” in the system to recover quickly from all but the most severe attacks. The ones that trouble the UK government most are used to transfer banking data across the Atlantic and are integral to the functioning of western financial markets. Satellite back-ups would not be able to handle the huge volume of information that flows through them every second of every day. The government started to worry about these vulnerabilities a decade ago, when George Osborne’s Treasury received a research paper from a young financier called Rishi Sunak, who had recently joined the Policy Exchange think tank. Secretive work was commissioned on how these cables could be better protected, but the answers were deemed to be in the “too-difficult category”, according to sources. Sunak’s paper would not be published until 2017, several years later. What troubles the military more profoundly is the ability of Russia to map, tap into or destroy military cables vital to its operations around the world. “There are cables that are not public,” said one senior source. “The Russians have the capability to cut military cables.” President Putin speaks at the launch last month of the Perm, a nuclear-powered submarine that can carry the Zircon hypersonic missile GAVRIIL GRIGOROV/SPUTNIK Before the visit to the Proteus, two senior UK sources told The Sunday Times that in around 2020, Russian UUVs — remotely operated and capable of operating at deep depths and travelling for hundreds of miles for days at a time — were found next to sensitive underwater cables. There was no mothership or submarine near by, suggesting they had travelled a great distance to reach the cables. The Ministry of Defence deemed it “beyond reasonable doubt” that the UUVs were attempting to hack the cables, although no evidence to date suggests Russia has succeeded. However, it has uncovered proof of other Russian activity that is altogether more disturbing. Hiding in plain sight In recent years, the navy has found a number of sensor devices in the seas around Britain. The Ministry of Defence believes they were planted there by Moscow in order to detect the movements of Britain’s four Vanguard submarines, which together make up the UK’s constant at-sea nuclear deterrent. After leaving Faslane in Scotland, the submarines “vanish” and are supposed to be invisible from enemy states for the entirety of their deployment, which is typically 90 days or more. It is not clear what type of sensors were found. Several had washed up on the shore, but more have been identified using the Royal Navy’s fleet of mine-hunter vessels. As they searched, the navy found other sensors it did not know were there, The Ministry of Defence said the at-sea deterrent remains “undetected.” Whether the UK has discovered evidence of other Russian activity is top secret. “It’s a bit like the space race,” said one senior UK source. “This is a world clouded in secrecy and subterfuge, it’s very hard to get absolute clarity. But there’s enough smoke to suggest something is on fire somewhere.” Catching up In 2021, the Integrated Review — a master document outlining the UK’s national security and foreign policy aims after Brexit — committed to purchasing a surveillance ship to protect the UK’s critical underwater infrastructure and to allow the authorities to better understand the scale of the threat. Two years later, the MoD bought a Norwegian deep-water offshore support vessel, the Topaz Tangaroa, for £70 million. It was modified and renamed the Proteus before becoming operational in October 2023. The ship has a permanent crew of about 30 civilian sailors from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the merchant arm of the navy, but is ultimately run by specialist naval teams. Life on the Proteus is demanding and the ship is expected to be at sea 330 days a year. A week before The Sunday Times visit, members of the navy’s mine-hunting and threat-exploitation teams had embedded for the first time. Among them was X-Ray Squadron, which uses autonomous underwater vehicles for mine-hunting, as well as identifying and destroying threats. During our visit, the teams were training with one of their newest assets: the SeaCat, a cutting-edge 3m-long, torpedo-shaped autonomous vehicle. It has a high-resolution camera on its nose and advanced sonar systems on its sides like wings. LPHOT BILL SPURR/MOD It is capable of running for 24 hours at depths of 300m and one of the commanding officers says it is typically between “three and six times quicker” at hunting mines than conventional methods. Nearby, another team is preparing the Gavia, a UUV that can plunge 1,000m, deep enough to cover most of the waters surrounding the UK. LPHOT BILL SPURR/MOD Then there is the Defender, which can be fitted with an array of equipment, including manipulator arms. Porton Down, the military’s top-secret research facility, has been developing arms capable of handling and planting shaped charges, a precision explosive that can be used to disable enemy mines. MOD/CROWN COPYRIGHT LPHOT BILL SPURR/MOD This capability was tested recently off the coast of Norway, where the Proteus was sent to coincide with a visit by John Healey, the defence secretary, who is negotiating a deal with Oslo to work more closely together to counter the Russian threat. All three vehicles also have sophisticated sonar systems to scan large areas of sea bed. If they find suspicious activity, they can be sent closer to capture high-resolution images. Captain Simon Pressdee, one of the senior officers on the visit, said: “Our role is to both defeat any threats to the UK as well as take it out of the greyzone. We do the latter by understanding who is involved and providing that evidence to avoid misunderstandings and make those who threaten the UK accountable for their actions.” The Proteus has other assets that are able to delve to the deepest part of the ocean, although these were hidden away on the visit. Captain Simon Pressdee LPHOT BILL SPURR/MOD Future-proofing With the government committed to spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence by 2027, further investment in sea-bed warfare is coming. The strategic defence review, commissioned by Healey to plug the gaps in Britain’s armed forces, is expected to recommend sharper focus on underwater infrastructure. Ministers have already accelerated the roll-out of the navy’s first autonomous mine-hunting vessel, the Ariadne and are rolling out a cutting-edge unmanned submarine under a programme called Project Cetus. The purchase of another Proteus-style ship is also being discussed. “Our adversary has multiple points of action that they can be playing, and we’ve only got one ship that can deal with it,” one insider said. John Healey showed his Norwegian counterpart, Tore Sandvik, around the Proteus in February as the two countries negotiate a closer defence partnership LEON NEAL/GETTY IMAGES As part of the review, the navy has proposed a new programme, Atlantic Bastion, which will develop a new fleet of air, surface and submersible vehicles, as well as sensors, to police British waters and the wider north Atlantic. In the shorter term, a project codenamed Cabot will get these capabilities up and running in partnership with private industries that rely on underwater infrastructure. This is likely to mean companies are asked to help fund operations, sources said. A similar idea has been pushed for years by Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the former Tory transport secretary and defence minister. “If this is a national endeavour, it is perhaps time to consider legislating for a level of assured protections of our energy, water, subsea cables … by asking everyone to chip in to the costs,” she said. “A hypothecated tax paid into a defence fund, which can provide protections and deterrence from those who wish our economic security and way of life harm, must be the way.” An MoD spokesman said: “We are committed to enhancing the security of critical offshore infrastructure. Alongside our NATO and Joint Expeditionary Force allies, we are strengthening our response to ensure that Russian ships and aircraft cannot operate in secrecy near the UK or near NATO territory, harnessing new technologies like AI and coordinating patrols with our allies. And our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent continues to patrol the world’s oceans undetected as it has done for 56 years.” Privately, some in the navy think the UK needs to go further and restore its capability to lay sea mines, something it has not done since the end of the Cold War. The last stockpiles were dispensed with in 1992, due to the ethical concerns of successive governments and the belief they were redundant. However, Australia has recently pledged £500 million for sea mines, and the Russian threat has reopened the question in the minds of some personnel. Poland and the Baltic states recently announced plans to withdraw from a treaty banning anti-personnel mines. The navy is not considering this at present and no proposal has been put forward as part of the strategic defence review. But one official, speaking anonymously, said the UK may well need to be able to lay defensive fields around British waters to keep out enemy submarines. Sir Keir Starmer’s government has clearly realised the scale of the threat, with billions of pounds of extra defence spending putting Britain closer to a war footing. Given what is happening beneath the waves, that investment is needed now more than ever.

His main rival has hinted at potential electoral fraud. https://p.dw.com/p/4t3Nl Oligui Nguema led a coup against the Bongos, who he served under for years Image: Nao Mukadi/AFP Advertisement Polling centers closed in Gabon on Saturday after a presidential election which junta chief Brice Oligui Nguema is widely expected to win. Oligui Nguema, who led a coup in August 2023 and a month later declared himself transitional president , had been leading in pre-election polls. He campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket. He has also emphasized the need to break from the dynasty of Omar Bongo Ondimba and his son and successor Ali Bongo, who together ruled Gabon for more than 50 years. 'Confident' Oligui Nguema tipped to remain in power In the run up to the election — the first to be held in the country since the coup — Oligui Nguema had predicted a "historic victory." "I am very confident. May the best man win," he said as he cast his ballot alongside his wife Zita at a school in the center of the Gabonese capital Libreville. His main opponent, Alain Claude "Bilie" By Nze, who was prime minister before the coup, has cast himself as the candidate for a "complete rupture" with the country's past. He has accused Oligui Nguema, who led the Republican Guard under the Bongos, of continuing their legacy. After casting his ballot, Nze warned reporters of potential "problems" during the counting. Oligui Nguema's main opponent, Bilie By Nze, has hinted at potential fraud Image: Daniel Beloumou Olomo/AFP "We'll see what it will bring," he added. Election monitors at the Citizens Observers Network (ROC) said they were denied access to several voting offices, but Oligui Nguema insisted the election had been "transparent" and "peaceful." Ballot counting started shortly after 6 pm (5 pm UTC) when most polling centers closed, although some remained open for voters who were still waiting to cast their ballot. Around 920,000 Gabonese were eligible to vote. The interior ministry said turnout was 87.12%. Initial results are expected to be announced on Sunday. The winner will be handed a seven-year mandate that can be renewed once. Why does the election matter? It is the Sahel nation's first election since the 2023 coup ousted the Bongo dynasty from power. The election in the former French colony of 2.3 million people comes amid high unemployment, regular power and water shortages and heavy government debt. The small West African country is resource-rich, with significant deposits of petroleum, manganese, and iron ore. Gabon 2025 election: An example for the Sahel nations?

Is a vote possible in wartime Ukraine? How has the war divided Western countries? ‘The Russian military is not this unstoppable machine’ News | Russia-Ukraine war Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,143 These are the key events on day 1,143 of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Servicemen of the 68th Oleksa Dovbush Separate Jaeger Brigade of Ukraine launch a Leleka reconnaissance drone near the front-line town of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Ukraine, on April 10, 2025 [Inna Varenytsia/Reuters] Published On 12 Apr 2025 12 Apr 2025 Here is where things stand on Saturday, April 12: Fighting Russia’s defence ministry said air defence units destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones within a span of 30 minutes late on Friday. The ministry said that between 10-10:30pm local time (19:00-19:30 GMT), nine drones were destroyed over Russia’s Rostov region on Ukraine’s eastern border, and four in the Kursk region on Ukraine’s northern border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the site of a deadly Russian attack on his hometown of Kryvyi Rih, one week after a Russian missile strike killed 19 people, including nine children and teenagers. Ukrainian officials have in recent days sent Washington a list of targets it believes Russia has struck in violation of the energy infrastructure ceasefire that Kyiv and Moscow agreed to last month as part of efforts by the United States to reach a ceasefire. Military analysts believe Russia is preparing to launch a new military offensive in the coming weeks to ramp up pressure and strengthen the Kremlin’s hand in ceasefire negotiations. Advertisement President Zelenskyy said that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting at the Ukraine front line alongside Russian forces, and accused Moscow of dragging Beijing into its invasion of his country. “As of now, we have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia’s occupation forces,” Zelenskyy said. More than 100 Chinese citizens fighting for the Russian military against Ukraine are mercenaries who do not appear to have a direct link to China’s government, two US officials familiar with American intelligence and a former Western intelligence official told the Reuters news agency. Chinese military officers have, however, been in the theatre of war behind Russia’s lines with Beijing’s approval to draw tactical lessons from the war, officials told Reuters. Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was ready to purchase additional air defence systems, adding that he discussed it with US President Donald Trump. Ceasefire Talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Russia lasted more than four hours, with no concrete results disclosed. According to Russia’s Interfax news agency, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not rule out the possibility of another phone call between Putin and Trump following the discussions. Trump said in a post earlier on Truth Social: “Russia has to get moving. Too many people [are] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!” Russia has rejected a US-backed proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire and appears to be dragging its feet on a more limited truce in the Black Sea agreed last month, analysts said. Advertisement German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Friday, after presiding over a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group in Brussels alongside British Defence Secretary John Healey, that “ongoing aggression” from Russia meant “we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future”. If a ceasefire is not achieved by the end of this month, Trump could impose additional sanctions on Russia, the US news site Axios reported, citing an anonymous source. Ukraine could be partitioned like Berlin after World War II, President Trump’s envoy to Kyiv, General Keith Kellogg, appeared to suggest as Russia continues to hold out on accepting a truce. In an interview with The Times newspaper, Kellogg said the country could be split into zones of control, with British and French troops as part of a “reassurance force” in the west and Moscow’s forces in the east. Between them would be Ukrainian forces and a demilitarised zone. Military Aid European countries have promised to send billions of dollars in further funding to help Ukraine keep fighting Russia’s invasion. Ukraine’s allies pledged a record 21 billion euros ($23.9bn) of military aid for the country, with the United Kingdom Defence Secretary Healey warning that 2025 was “the critical year” for the war. Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said that his country is monitoring the world armaments market and sees opportunities for Ukraine’s backers to buy more weapons and ammunition. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was absent from the Ukraine donor’s forum that the US established and led for several years, although he spoke to the meeting via video. Advertisement Sanctions A former Russian government minister who violated UK sanctions by receiving financial support from family members was sentenced to more than three years in prison in England. Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, who was appointed governor of Sevastopol in Russian-annexed Crimea by Putin, became the first person convicted of violating the sanctions put in place after the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Estonia’s navy said it detained an oil tanker believed to belong to Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Gulf of Finland in order to check its papers. Regional security A reduction in the number of US soldiers in Eastern Europe would be seen as Washington moving another step closer to Moscow and a worrying sign for Europeans, according to analysts. The NBC news channel, quoting US and European sources, said this week that the US Department of Defense was looking at the withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Europe. President Putin announced billions in investments for the rearmament of his country’s navy. “In the next decade, 8.4 trillion roubles [around $97bn] are earmarked for the construction of new boats and ships for the navy,” Putin said at a meeting on navy development in Saint Petersburg, according to Russian news agencies. Putin said the navy would develop drone and robot technology, and he claimed that 49 warships of various classes have been built in Russian shipyards in the past five years, including nuclear submarines that can be equipped with new Zircon hypersonic missiles. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sharply criticised European Union politicians against the backdrop of a rapprochement between the Kremlin and the new US administration. Politicians such as acting German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, European Union top diplomat Kaja Kallas and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were not thinking of their voters, but had put the desire to punish Russia above the wellbeing of their own citizens, Lavrov said.

One witness across the road from the collision said his building shook from the force of the impact, adding "unfortunately I'm certain lives were lost here today". Footage from the scene showed palm trees lining the side of a highway on fire as sirens blared in the backround in the immediate aftermath of the crash, which happened near the glades overpass shortly after 10am local time. All three people on board the small aircraft were killed, according to local officials and the Federal Aviation Administration. Posting to X, a witness said: "Possible plane crash right outside my office today. Shook the whole building. Unfortunately I'm certain lives were lost here today. Thoughts and prayers to anyone who survived and the families of those who didn't. If you're in @CityBocaRaton stay away from military trail near the glades overpass." In a video shared alongside his tweet, a man was heard saying: "The whole building shakes". Another said: "I think a plane crashed." Another witness, posting to Snapchat, wrote: "What the f***, I just watched a plane fly into the ground." According to Flightradar, the aircraft was a Cessna 310R - an American four-to-six-seat, low-wing, twin-engine monoplane. The flight tracking site said: "We’re following reports of a crash of a small aircraft in Boca Raton. ADS-B data indicates the aircraft is Cessna 310R N8930N. The aircraft appears to have been trying to return to BCT shortly after takeoff." Palm trees on fire along a highway where the plane crashed ( Image: @CollinRugg/X) Boca Raton Police said: "N. Military Trail is closed between NW 19th St. and Butts Rd. due to small aircraft crash. I-95 overpass at Glades Rd. is also closed eastbound and westbound. Avoid the Area." According to flight tracking data, the plane had been circling above Boca Raton airport and appeared to be struggling to land before it crashed. The Cessna 310R was in the air for a little less than 20 minutes before it went down, according to Flightradar. Debris from the crash seen on nearby railroad tracks ( Image: AP) Harrowing videos shared online show apocalyptic scenes in the aftermath of the crash, with thick grey smoke billowing from the crash sit and small fires raging on next to the busy freeway. Fire officials told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that the aircraft appeared to have pushed a car onto the railroad tracks, leading to its closure. The aircraft is said to have pushed a car onto the tracks ( Image: FOX 5 Washington DC) Boca Raton Mayor Scott Singer has said an investigation into the crash has been launched. "We are deeply saddened to confirm that a plane crash occurred earlier today within our community. At this time, details are still emerging, and we are working closely with emergency responders and authorities," Singer said in a statement. "Our thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic event. We ask for patience and respect for the families involved as investigations continue." A damaged car near the site of the crash ( Image: AP) The plane was heading to Tallahassee International Airport and was carrying three people before it crashed, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It said in a statement: "A Cessna 310 crashed around 10:20 a.m. local time on Friday, April 11, after departing from Boca Raton Airport in Florida. Three people were on board. The plane was headed to Tallahassee International Airport. "The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will investigate. The NTSB will lead the investigation and provide any updates." Boca Raton is one of Florida's more wealthy neighbourhoods with a reputation for luxury living. The area is home to a robust business sector, a large retirement community, and several major corporations with headquarters there.

https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-responding-helicopter-hudson-river/16153664/: 24/7 Live New York City New Jersey Long Island Northern Suburbs Connecticut Welcome, Mickey mickey@disney.com Manage MyDisney Account Log Out Pilot, family of 5 from Spain killed after helicopter crashes into Hudson River Thursday, April 10, 2025 Josh Einiger has the latest from Jersey City on the deadly helicopter crash. JERSEY CITY, New Jersey (WABC) -- Six people were killed after a tourist helicopter carrying a family from Spain crashed into New York City's Hudson River on Thursday afternoon. The crash was reported at 3:17 p.m. on the Jersey City side of the Hudson. Agustin Escobar, a Siemens executive from Barcelona, Spain, his wife Merce Camprubi Montal, and their children, ages 4, 5, and 11, were killed in the crash, law enforcement sources told ABC News. The pilot, who was 36, was also killed, making a total six people. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the helicopter was operated by New York Helicopters. The FAA believes the helicopter is a Bell 206 and appears to have taken off from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport at 2:59 p.m. It went up to the George Washington Bridge before turning back south along the Jersey side of the river. It went off radar at 3:25 p.m. Dan Krauth has more on the flight path of the helicopter that crashed into the Hudson River. Video shared with Eyewitness News appeared to show pieces of the helicopter break apart and crash into the water. Officials say the helicopter hit the water inverted, without a tail rotor or a main rotor blade. Video shows the moments before a helicopter crashed into the Hudson River. For witnesses, it turned out to be a memory full of horror. "I watched it fall out of the sky! I heard five or six loud noises that sounded almost like gunshots in the sky and saw pieces fall off, then watched it fall into the river," said Dani Horbiak, who saw the crash from her apartment window. "It sounded like a sonic boom on my right and so I look up and literally I see a helicopter splitting in two with the rotor flying off and this guy was going straight into the water and nothing came up afterwards," said a witness named Max. CeFaan Kim has more from witnesses in Thursday's deadly helicopter crash. Officials say the entire flight lasted all of 15 minutes, before witnesses say it took an upside-down nosedive. "It just kind of fell apart and it was the most terrifying thing that we ever witnessed," Rajany said. "I heard some crackling, looked up and then just saw a plane falling apart," said witness Bruce Wall. "And then maybe 15 feet in the air after the tail came off, broke off, and then the plane just sort of tumbled into the water with the propeller still in the air." FDNY and NYPD divers were in the water almost immediately and assisted in the recovery. Four of the victims were declared dead at the scene and two victims were sent to local hospitals where they were pronounced dead. Jersey City Medical Center, where the passengers were transported after the crash, tried as hard as they could, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said. "Our hearts go out to the family and those on board," Mayor Eric Adams said. A crane vessel hoisted the crumpled wreckage of the helicopter out of the Hudson and onto a barge Thursday night. Fulop said the main body of the aircraft has been recovered and is in the Army Corps of Engineers facility on Chapel Avenue, however major parts of the aircraft have still not been recovered. He says dive operations by the NYPD and NJSP will resume Friday morning. Police fished out chunks of jagged metal that washed up to the Jersey City shore, along with a life preserver, a seat and the personal effects of a family of five. The Spanish Consulate of New York City is now in touch with authorities to gather and confirm information and identification of the people involved in the helicopter crash, according to the communications team at the Spanish Foreign Ministry. The Jersey City Police Department is taking the lead on the investigation since the helicopter crashed on the Jersey City side of the river, Fulop said. Fulop said tours in the area are constant and fall within a busy and heavily trafficked area. He hopes this will increase the dialogue to decrease traffic. "Hopefully this brings some more attention to it, that the fact beyond just noise, you have real safety concerns," Fulop said. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop joins Eyewitness News to discuss the tragedy Wednesday afternoon. The FAA says they are temporarily halting all operations around the Hudson River crash site. The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate the crash, and is expected to arrive on Thursday night. They will have to piece together what went wrong, and what caused the rotors to break apart, dooming the 21-year-old helicopter and the six people aboard. At least 32 people have died in helicopter crashes in NYC since 1977 -- most recently in 2019 when a helicopter used for executive travel hit the roof of Manhattan skyscraper in restricted airspace and the pilot was killed. John Del Giorno has more after six people were killed after a helicopter crashed into the Hudson River. ---------- * Get Eyewitness News Delivered * Follow us on YouTube * More local news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Submit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

At Santa Marta, they are truly navigating by sight. The pleasant "surprise" that Pope Francis wanted to offer for tomorrow's Angelus at noon, showing himself in front of the cameras for a few minutes—from inside Santa Marta—will have to wait for a more favorable time. When will that be? Who knows. In the Vatican, they shrug their shoulders despondently. From the airtight isolation on the second floor of the Domus where Bergoglio lives, hardly anything emerges, though many, knowing the stubbornness and unpredictability of this pontiff, do not even exclude that tomorrow morning, perhaps feeling a bit better than today, he might try again to record the brief message of thanks that he declined. This afternoon, Vatican technicians arrived at Santa Marta with all the equipment, awaiting instructions. They waited a bit and were eventually sent back. Francis didn't feel up to it. Nothing particularly concerning, and perhaps it's even normal for a patient with such a clinical picture to have moments of reconsideration, weakness, or temporary apathy, followed by alternating better phases. Yesterday, the Vatican staff had announced that Sunday's appointment would finally be different and would break the heavy media silence that has been ongoing for months. Naturally, no particular details were added, although it was clear that the Pope could now perfectly record a short video to circulate at noon. A second hypothesis was even seriously considered, that he might appear live in front of the cameras for a few minutes, just enough time to bless and thank the faithful worldwide for the devotion shown during his illness. Tomorrow, the Angelus for the eighth consecutive Sunday should only be in written form. It is also expected that at the end of the Mass in St. Peter's Square for the Jubilee of the Sick, Monsignor Rino Fisichella will read a brief papal message to the faithful. Bergoglio wants to express gratitude to millions of people who send a thought, a prayer, a message, a letter, or a drawing to the Vatican every day. Since the health risks for the pontiff are still quite high at this stage of convalescence, every decision is evaluated by the attending physicians and healthcare workers who, in agreement with the illustrious patient, help orient towards the best solution. The "protected convalescence" path—as it was called by the hospital team—requires several weeks of care and caution, and the slightest misstep can be dangerous, even excessive strain on the vocal cords already stressed during the long hospital stay for high-flow oxygen administration. Any uncalculated risk can turn back the clock. Consequently, everything is measured with common sense. Probably, Pope Francis is chomping at the bit; the isolation period is heavy, and he desires to soon resume some activities, for example, communicating with people again as he did before, even through indirect communication methods. In the Vatican, they assure that the improvements towards recovery are real, visible, and noticeable daily, thanks to motor and respiratory therapies, but bilateral pneumonia is not yet healed, the foci persist, and antibiotic treatments are still ongoing. To date, it's difficult to imagine if and when Pope Francis will be able to do the same things as before, such as intense and tiring trips, long celebrations, or the deadly concentration of daily appointments on the agenda. For this month, the meeting of the Council of Cardinals (the fifty-first) has been canceled: it was announced at the beginning of last December for April 2025 and would have been used to discuss the Synod and synodality. Meanwhile, Pope Francis from the Gemelli Polyclinic last month arranged that in 2028 he wants to convene a worldwide Ecclesial Assembly instead of the ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops. An attentive observer like Luis Badilla, former director of the para-Vatican site Sismografo, wonders if "four months ago there was or wasn't this project? Or was it only thought of in these last three months? Above all, I wonder why the communication was made while the Pope was hospitalized and, finally, why nothing was anticipated to the members of the Council of Cardinals?" © ALL RIGHTS RESERVED This article is automatically translated © 2025 Il MESSAGGERO - C.F. e P.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi.(PMO via PTI Photo) (PMO) Modi departed hours after US President Donald Trump slapped what he said were 26% “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on Indian exports to the US, and a formal Indian response is expected from the commerce ministry, people familiar with the matter said. The Thailand leg of the visit will be watched closely for a possible encounter or meeting between Modi and Bangladesh interim government chief Muhammad Yunus. People familiar with planning for the trip had earlier said a formal meeting is unlikely, but the Bangladesh side has made a strong push for a meeting over the past few days. In a statement ahead of his departure, Modi said he expected the visits to build on foundations of the past and contribute to strengthening India’s close relationships for the benefit of the wider region. He said he was travelling to Thailand at the invitation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to attend the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) Summit. Over the past decade, Bimstec has emerged as a “significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region”, he said. Noting that India’s northeastern region lies at the heart of Bimstec, Modi said he would meet leaders of the grouping and engage “productively to further strengthen our collaboration”. Since India stymied the activities of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) by pulling out of a summit to be hosted by Pakistan in 2016, it has focused on Bimstec – which includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand – as a platform for driving regional cooperation. A maritime cooperation agreement is expected to be signed during the Bimstec Summit in Bangkok on April 4. Modi will also have bilateral meetings with Shinawatra and the Thai leadership to bolster relations between the two countries. He will hold talks with Shinawatra on Thursday evening before participating in a dinner hosted by the Thai premier for the Bimstec leaders. Following the summit on Friday, Modi will meet Thai King Vajiralongkorn. Modi will travel from Thailand to Sri Lanka on Friday evening. This trip follows the visit of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to India last December. “We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of ‘Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future’ and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,” Modi said. The people said India and Sri Lanka are expected to sign up to 10 agreements during the visit, including a crucial pact to refresh defence cooperation for the first time since the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) intervention during the island nation’s civil war in the late 1980s.

https://buenosairesherald.com/economics/caputo-confirms-us20-billion-deal-between-argentina-and-imf: Politics Economics Business Sports Culture & Ideas Op-ed Argentina 101 What to do in Argentina Search Search Wednesday, April 23, 2025 Politics Economics Business Sports Culture & Ideas Op-ed Argentina 101 What to do in Argentina Search Search Home Politics Economics Business Society World Sports Culture & Ideas Op-ed The Archives Argentina 101 What to do in Argentina Caputo confirms US$20 billion deal between Argentina and IMF staff Without giving a number, Fund spokeswoman Julie Kozack said a ‘sizeable package’ was in discussion Buenos Aires Herald March 27, 2025 Buenos Aires Herald March 27, 2025 Economy Minister Luis Caputo has confirmed that the Argentine government has reached an agreement with the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a US$20 billion loan. The agreement must now be approved by the Fund’s board of directors. IMF spokeswoman Julie Kozack did not give a figure during a Thursday press conference but described the deal as “sizable.” “What I can say now is that discussions on a new Fund-supported program are very advanced. And those discussions include discussions around a sizable financing package,” she said, but underscored that the final decision over the deal amount would fall to the IMF board. Regarding the payment schedule, she said: “As with all of our programs, disbursements will come in tranches over the life of the program. But the exact phasing and the size of each tranche is also, of course, part of the discussions that are underway.” Caputo spoke about the deal during an insurance conference on Thursday morning. “The sum we’ve agreed on, that the staff will submit for the board’s approval, is US$20 billion,” he said. “As you can see, it’s much higher than the amount that was rumored.” The minister said the IMF did not place the usual fiscal, monetary, and reserve conditions on the deal. He did not specify whether the government’s current 1% monthly crawling peg — the rate at which it devalues the peso against the dollar — would remain in place. President Javier Milei also spoke following Caputo’s announcement. In an interview, he said that IMF Managing Director Kristalina Giorgieva authorized the minister to disclose the amount of the loan last night. Milei also emphatically ruled out the possibility of a devaluation, which market sources take for granted. He said that, after the new loan, there will be “a lack of pesos, not a lack of dollars.” Kozack said that the parties were in ongoing discussions over what policies would be covered by the program but added: “To sustain the gains that have been achieved so far by the authorities, there is a shared recognition about the need to continue to adopt a consistent set of fiscal, monetary, and foreign exchange policies while fostering further and furthering growth-enhancing reforms.” Additional packages Caputo also said that the government is negotiating an additional package with the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (also known as CAF) “to strengthen the Central Bank’s reserves.” Gross reserves, according to Caputo, will increase to US$50 billion thanks to these loans. The monetary base, he said, currently sits at US$25 billion at the official exchange rate and at US$20 billion at the blue-chip swap dollar rate. “We will have double the amount of reserves than the current monetary base.” “Although I can’t give you any more details of the rest of the agreement due to confidentiality clauses, I thought it was important to tell you about the amount,” Caputo said. “Our goal is that, in the future, we can get access to markets again and that Argentina can at least refinance the capital in such a way that reserves continue to back pesos in the Central Bank.” He continued: “Not only is it different from the over 20 previous deals Argentina has had with the IMF, but it is also different from any other deal the IMF has reached with other countries.” Caputo explained that while IMF deals typically consist of the lender making gradual disbursements while demanding fiscal and monetary adjustments to put the country’s economy “in order,” this is not the case for Argentina’s new agreement. “We’ve already carried out those fiscal and monetary adjustments,” he said. After Milei took office in December 2023, the new administration evaluated the possibility of seeking a new loan from the IMF, “which wouldn’t have happened because the Fund would not commit more capital without seeing concrete results,” Caputo said. Another option was continuing the program from former President Alberto Fernández’s government. “If we focused on the goals fixed for the prior government, we couldn’t have stopped the crisis from happening. It wouldn’t have been enough to stop hyperinflation,” the minister added. In this scenario, Milei’s government decided to take on “much more challenging goals” and refrain from borrowing more money until the IMF was “convinced” that the administration would be able to comply with those goals. “That’s what we did. We ended the fiscal deficit in a month and ended monetary emission in six months,” Caputo said.

Get more news on / Updated By Marlene Lenthang and Phil Helsel The Table Rock wildfire burning in South Carolina continued to grow Thursday, but conditions that created dramatic expansion the day before eased, officials said. The fire, which was started March 21 by hikers, had burned an estimated 8,679 acres by 4:30 p.m. Thursday when a flight captured infrared data, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said . Hundreds of residents in North Carolina and South Carolina have been ordered to leave and structures have been destroyed in the fires, which are burning amid abnormally dry or drought conditions in both states. Downed timber left in the wake of Hurricane Helene, a devastating storm that struck in September, has also been fueling the fires' spread, officials have said. “The amount of downed debris and timber in the woods is almost indescribable,” Madeline Stewart, the South Carolina Forestry Commission Public Information Coordinator, said on NBC’s “TODAY” show. North Carolina fires In North Carolina, there are eight active wildfires in Caldwell, Buncombe, Polk, Jackson, Haywood and Swain counties, according to an interactive map by the North Carolina Forest Service. New fires sparked in dry conditions Wednesday, prompting Gov. Josh Stein to declare another state of emergency “to make sure we have every tool at our disposal” to respond to fires in the western part of the state. The worst blazes are the Black Cove Complex Fire and the Deep Woods Fire, both in Polk County and Henderson County. The Black Cove Complex fire has burned around 3,288 acres and was 17% contained Thursday evening, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture said in an update . The fire first ignited March 19 by a downed power line. "Fire behavior has continued to be intense, with rapid fire spread and extreme burning conditions due to high winds and dry weather," the department said.

There was progress on containment of that fire, which has burned an estimated 3,373 acres in size and was 30% contained by that evening, the department said. It was first reported March 19 and the cause is under investigation. A third fire that had prompted evacuation orders, the Fish Hook Fire, was 199 acres in size and 95% contained. Evacuation orders had previously been lifted. South Carolina fires In South Carolina, the Table Rock Fire and the Persimmon Ridge Fire were the two major wildfires in the state. The Persimmon Ridge Fire "saw only modest expansion" Thursday as conditions were milder than what was seen Wednesday, state officials said. The fire grew to 1,992 acres Thursday, but the state forestry department said most of that growth was from "burnouts" created by firefighters between existing fire breaks. The Table Rock Fire was started by “the negligent act of some hikers," the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office said last week. “The young men that are responsible for the fire have been identified. The investigation is continuing by agents and detectives with the sheriff’s office as well as those with the South Carolina Forestry Commission, and the appropriate charges will be discussed and made at a later date,” Sheriff Tommy Blankenship said in a March 21 statement. On Wednesday, the South Carolina Forestry commission called for the immediate evacuations of residents in Greenville and Pickens counties. “Never in my 52 years did I think would I be running from my home in a fire,” said Wendy Clarke, who evacuated her home in the Caesar's Head area near the Persimmon Ridge Fire to a local shelter.

The death toll included a pilot who died after a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a blaze in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the hardest-hit areas. The aircraft had no other crew members. Police said that most of the dead are those in their 60s and 70s. READ MORE: Wildfires in Japan force residents to evacuate homes in mountains The National Fire Agency said at least 26 people sustained varying degrees of injuries. An ancient Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 17,752 hectares (43,866 acres), the government’s emergency response center said. In a televised address, South Korea’s acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were worse than many previous ones. “Damages are snowballing,” Han said. “There are concerns that we’ll have wildfire damages that we’ve never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week.” Han said crews struggled to extinguish the wildfires because strong winds swept the areas overnight. He also said about 4,650 firefighters, soldiers and other personnel were working Wednesday with the help of about 130 helicopters, adding that “a small amount” of 5-10 millimeters (0.1-0.3 inches) of rain was expected Thursday. As of Wednesday evening, firefighters were tackling at least six active wildfires, including in the southeastern coastal town of Yeongdeok, which alerted residents of the nearest village to evacuate to an indoor gymnasium. Strong winds and smoke-filled skies forced authorities in the southeastern city of Andong to order evacuations in two villages, including Puncheon, home to the Hahoe folk village — a UNESCO World Heritage Site founded around the 14th-15th century. Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri Mountain, one of the country’s largest national parks, as another fire spread closer. Observers say the ongoing wildfires are the third biggest in South Korea’s history in terms of land burned. The largest fires were in Andong, the neighboring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan. On Tuesday, officials said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again. The blaze in Uiseong destroyed about 20 of the 30 buildings and structures at Gounsa, a temple said to be originally built in the 7th century. Among the burned structures were two state-designated “treasures” — a pavilion-shaped building erected overlooking a stream in 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king. Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry said it protectively removed 500 inmates from a detention center in Cheongsong, another southern town, but no damages were reported to the facility. The Korea Forest Service said it had raised its wildfire warning to the highest level nationwide, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises. Among the dead were four firefighters and government workers who died in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds, according to officials. Government officials suspect human error caused several of the fires, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.
