                    People head towards their homes in the Shijaiyah neighborhood, Gaza City, on January 28,
                    2025. Displaced Palestinians return following a ceasefire, finding their neighborhoods in
                    ruins.

    <p>TEL AVIV, Israel — Egypt announced Sunday it would host a summit of Arab leaders later in the month, amid
        alarm in the region over President Trump's proposals regarding the future of Gaza.</p>

                <h3><a>Trump says the U.S.
                        will 'take over' Gaza and relocate its people. What does it mean?</a></h3>
            </div>

    <p>A statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry says the summit is being called in response to a Palestinian
        request.</p>
    <p>It said the leaders will gather on Feb. 27 to discuss "the new and dangerous developments in the Palestinian
        issue."</p>
    <p>Also Sunday, Israeli forces began withdrawing from the Netzarim corridor in Gaza, in the latest stage of the
        ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.</p>
    <p>The Netzarim corridor is a four mile strip of land bisecting northern and southern Gaza that Israel fortified
        during the war, using it as a military zone. Last month, as part of the ceasefire deal, Israel started
        allowing Palestinians to cross the Netzarim corridor and return to their homes in the North.</p>
    <p>The withdrawal is part of the six week first phase of the ceasefire, in which Hamas is gradually releasing 33
        Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, while allowing aid to
        Gaza.</p>
    <p>In the next stage of the ceasefire, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete
        Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and "sustainable calm."</p>
    <p>But negotiations are ongoing on the details. Israel wants Hamas' military and political capabilities
        eliminated, while Hamas wants all Israeli troops removed from Gaza.</p>
    <p>Egypt's announcement of a summit comes less than a week after many Arab states rejected Trump's recent
        comments about relocating Gaza's residents and creating a "Riviera of the Middle East" there, as have
        Palestinian leaders.</p>
    <p>Trump made the proposal Tuesday when he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington D.C.
        Speaking to reporters at the White House Friday, Trump said he viewed the proposal as "a real estate
        transaction, where we'll be an investor in that part of the world." He added that he was in "no rush to do
        anything."</p>
    <p>Several countries also condemned a suggestion by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — that Saudi
        Arabia has enough land for a Palestinian state.</p>
    <p>Netanyahu appeared to be joking in response to a slip by an Israeli TV interviewer, but his words
        reverberated through the region at a time when tensions are running high. </p>

    <p>Also on Sunday, there were emotional scenes in Bangkok airport, as five Thai workers who were released after
        being held hostage for over a year in Gaza arrived back home.</p>
    <p>"We are all very grateful and very happy that we get to return to our homeland. We all would really like to
        thank you. I don't know what else to say," one of the Thai hostages, Pongsak Thaenna, told a news conference
        at the airport.</p>
    <p>The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' attack that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage, has killed more
        than 47,000 Palestinians according to local health authorities.</p>
    <p>In recent days, violence in the West Bank has intensified. On Sunday morning, the Palestinian Health Ministry
        said a 23-year-old Palestinian woman, who was eight months pregnant, was fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in
        the Nur Shams urban refugee camp in northern occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said in a statement
        that it is investigating the incident.</p>
