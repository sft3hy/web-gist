https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250321008951315?section=national/diplomacy,"TOKYO, March 22 (Yonhap) -- The top diplomats of South Korea, Japan and China met in Tokyo on Saturday for talks expected to focus on advancing trilateral cooperation, amid economic and security uncertainties from the second U.S. administration of President Donald Trump. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for the three-way dialogue, as the three Asian neighbors are seeking to hold a leaders' summit later this year. In Saturday's talks, the ministers are expected to broadly discuss efforts to advance the tripartite partnership in economy, culture, and people-to-people exchanges, as well as regional and global issues, including those related to the Korean Peninsula. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul (R) poses for a photo with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya (C) and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on March 21, 2025, as they arrived for a dinner reception at a hotel in Tokyo, where the three ministers have gathered for trilateral talks. (Yonhap) ""Peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula are essential for the peace and prosperity of East Asia and the world,"" Cho said in the opening remarks. ""I hope to have a candid discussion on the North Korean nuclear issue today."" Cho said the three-way talks will ""reaffirm commitment to continued cooperation and deepen future collaboration."" Iwaya highlighted the need for the three countries to ""overcome conflict and division through dialogue and cooperation."" ""While the three neighbors face difficulties, it's highly important to have candid conversations and pursue forward-looking exchanges at the same time,"" he said. Wang called the three-way cooperation the ""most promising"" framework for development in East Asia, saying the three sides are working to resume negotiations for the free trade agreement at an early date. The three ministers are scheduled to hold a joint press conference following the talks. Cho will join Iwaya for separate bilateral talks on the same day. Cho arrived in Japan Friday and met one-on-one with Wang on the same day. At Saturday's talks, the three sides are also expected to coordinate efforts to facilitate a successful summit of the countries' leaders. Japan is the host for this year's gathering, widely expected to take place later this year. They could also discuss ways the three Asian neighbors can cooperate in the context of growing uncertainties and challenges posed by Trump's trade policies amid the rivalry between Washington and Beijing. On security issues, they are likely to exchange assessments on North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations and Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine. The three Asian neighbors held their last foreign ministers' dialogue in South Korea's southern city of Busan in November 2023, attended by Wang and then Foreign Ministers Park Jin and Yoko Kamikawa. The previous three-way summit took place in Seoul in May last year between President Yoon Suk Yeol, then Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang. elly@yna.co.kr(END)","(LEAD) Top diplomats of S.

https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-03-21/mexican-auschwitz-opens-its-doors-the-only-truth-is-that-they-dont-care-about-the-missing.html,"The ranch of horror has opened its doors. The “Mexican Auschwitz,” as it has come to be known, is a compound in the middle of harvested sugarcane fields, accessible through a black iron gate riddled with bullet holes. Inside, there is little to see: a barren field with four dusty palm trees, filthy bathrooms, and three sheds with tin roofs. On March 5, a group of people searching for their missing relatives entered unannounced and discovered human skeletal remains, signs of cremations, hundreds of items of clothing, toiletries, and even toys. But the image that has shocked the public and evoked comparisons to Nazi atrocities is the pile of abandoned shoes that was found. The Izaguirre ranch in Teuchitlán, in the Mexican state of Jalisco, is one of the many training camps used by organized crime to recruit young people to their cause. It is also known that these recruits are subjected to the cruelest practices to strip them of any fear of using knives and guns, even forcing them to kill one another. Many of the thousands of people who have disappeared in Mexico have fallen into the hands of cartels. And it is no longer known whether they are alive or dead. Several groups of searchers from Jalisco, as well as from other states, visited the ranch on Thursday. Muffled cries were heard, faded by the shock, but above all, there was despair as it became clear that there was no more evidence inside. “Why did they bring us here?” asked one person. “This is a mockery,” said another. “The only truth is that they don’t care about the missing,” one individual told the press, which was also granted access to the ranch for the first time. The Jalisco Prosecutor’s Office, at the request of the Attorney General’s Office, chartered seven buses and transported dozens of journalists, who jostled at the doors of the ranch in the stifling heat. Inside, the searchers scoured through the dirt floor with their feet and found a few socks, a blue Adidas backpack, a gold-handled razor, and some toothbrushes. “This is how they search for clues,” one of them sarcastically remarked before several microphones. The shock from the macabre discovery on March 5 was followed by disbelief at the sloppy work of the Jalisco State Prosecutor’s Office. The authorities had entered the ranch last September, arrested 10 people, rescued two, and recovered a body — but little else. The site was supposedly sealed off, yet in the months following that operation, two vehicles were stolen from the location. It was left virtually abandoned. Little to nothing is known about the survivors; no statements were taken, no fingerprints were collected, and no questions were raised about the owners of the ranch, located just a few miles from Guadalajara, one of Mexico’s wealthiest cities. All of this has been publicly condemned by Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero. This kind of negligence is attributed to either fear of organized crime or collusion with it, and such failures of law enforcement are common across the country. The Attorney General’s Office has since taken over the case, removing all clothes, shoes, and items, which have been displayed to the public in the hopes that they will be identified by the relatives of the missing. However, the outrage over the state’s handling of the investigation is overwhelming. So many missed opportunities. The ranch is now fully dug up, with excavations made in the ground to search for clues. In some of the holes, red flags indicate “positive” results, while in certain corners, there are mounds of ash. The ranch has been opened to the public, but information remains scarce or nonexistent. How many young men and women passed through there, how long ago, who survived, whose bones were found, what exactly happened there, and since when? There is nothing to report while the Prosecutor’s Office conducts its investigation, but it has already been made clear that the initial team responsible for gathering evidence failed, and the searchers fear that, once again, they’ll pass the buck and the case will be closed without any results. It is assumed that the brutal training camp was controlled by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which dominates the area, but even that remains uncertain. On the unpaved floor of one of the sheds lie rudimentary weights made from two rusty cans filled with cement. On the wall, there are other metal objects that also seemed to be intended for physical exercise. “They want them strong,” says a woman involved in the search, referring to the forced recruitment by criminal organizations. Beside her, a young woman wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the image of her missing loved one finds no solace, sitting on the cobblestones and embracing her friends from the bus. In Mexico, 124,000 people have been officially missing for several decades. The earliest cases were victims of the state itself, during what became known as the Dirty War, when the military and police took away people who opposed the regime. The missing people of today are victims of organized crime. Some voluntarily join their ranks, while others are abducted daily from neighborhoods, streets, and highways, never to be seen again. Some may be dead, but others may have endured the horrific indoctrination in these camps and turned into criminals themselves. All of them are being searched for by their mothers.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/khamenei-says-houthis-act-independently-warns-against-us-strikes-on-iran/,"Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said Friday that the Houthis, an Iran-aligned terror group that controls much of Yemen, act on their own motivations, after US President Donald Trump said he would hold Tehran accountable for the group’s actions. Khamenei also warned, “If the US or anyone else commits any malicious act against Iran, they will receive a severe blow,” in comments made in a televised speech, echoed by official social media posts. Trump said Monday that he would hold Iran responsible for any attacks carried out by the Houthis, as the American military carried out waves of strikes against the group, marking the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since he returned to the White House. The Houthis, whose slogan calls for “death to America, death to Israel, [and] a curse on the Jews,” have fired four missiles at Israel since Tuesday, all of which were intercepted, and none of which caused any casualties. The group resumed its attacks on Israel after fighting resumed in the Gaza Strip, amid the collapse of a hostage-ceasefire deal with the Hamas terror group. Americans, said Khamenei on Friday, “make a big mistake and call regional resistance centers Iranian proxies. What does proxy mean?” “The Yemeni nation has its own motivation and the resistance groups in the region have their own motivations. Iran doesn’t need proxies,” Khamenei said. The US “issue threats,” he added, but “we have never started a confrontation or conflict with anyone. However, if anyone acts with malice and initiates it, they will receive severe slaps.” Over the years, Iran has been aligned with groups across the region that describe themselves as the “Axis of Resistance” to Israel and US influence. Those groups include Hamas, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and various Shiite terror groups in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic Republic also counted the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad — ousted by Islamist rebels in December — as an ally. The Houthis began attacking ships in the Red Sea in November 2023, a month after Hamas stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza. While the Houthis have said they were attacking Israeli-linked shipping in support of Gaza, they have also targeted vessels with no known Israeli connections. The Iran-backed rebels also fired some 40 ballistic missiles at Israel, from November 2023 until just days before the Gaza hostage-ceasefire deal was reached in January 2025. They also launched several attack drones at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July. Responding to the attacks, Israel has carried out several strikes on Houthi sites in Yemen.","Khamenei says Houthis act independently, warns against US strikes on Iran","Agencies, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-03-21T12:02:39,2025-03-21T12:02:39,gemini-2.0-flash

There are no immediate reports of injuries or damage in the attack. The IDF says the missile was shot down before crossing the country’s borders.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-willing-to-temporarily-relocate-half-a-million-gazans-to-sinai-report/,"Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has informed other Arab leaders that he is willing to temporarily relocate half a million residents from Gaza to northern Sinai in a designated city as part of the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, according to a Friday report. According to the report in the Lebanese Al-Akhbar newspaper, Sissi made his willingness known during meetings held by Arab leaders in recent weeks in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. There was no confirmation of the report from any other source. The	Egyptian State Information Service denied the report, saying, “Egypt’s position is firm in its absolute and final rejection of any attempt to displace Palestinians, and the Cairo Arab Summit’s emergency plan for reconstruction is based on it.” In public statements, Sissi and Jordan’s King Abdullah have repeatedly rebuffed US President Donald Trump’s assertion that the two Arab countries could take in Palestinian refugees on a permanent basis under his plan to empty the Gaza Strip of its residents and turn it into a “riviera.” The issue is of crucial significance for Jordan and Egypt, which fear that an influx of Palestinians will destabilize their countries. Throughout the recent two-month ceasefire between Hamas and Israel — which collapsed this week — Arab leaders held several summits regarding Gaza and their vision for “the day after the war.” At an Arab League summit in Cairo in early March, Egypt presented its plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and emphasized that it would not include the displacement of residents. The Arab plan envisions an independent committee of technocrats governing Gaza for six months before handing control to the Palestinian Authority.	The plan does not mention Hamas by name, instead stating that the fate of all armed groups in Gaza can only be fully addressed through a political process that leads to a Palestinian state. According to previous reports in Arab media, the plan only includes the internal relocation of Gazans within Gaza to clear rubble and rebuild buildings and neighborhoods. According to a United Nations analysis from September, over two-thirds of Gaza’s structures have been damaged or destroyed during the war sparked on October 7, 2023, when Hamas rampaged through southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 hostages. Recently, the Trump administration has been sending mixed signals regarding its stance on the Egypt-led Arab plan for post-war Gaza. Initially, Trump spoke multiple times about his vision of emptying Gaza of its more than 2 million Palestinian residents and reconstructing the Strip, even suggesting that Israel would hand Gaza over to the US after the war. Then, on March 7, US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, called the Arab proposal a “good-faith first step” with “a lot of compelling features.” Hours later, however, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce characterized the proposal as “inadequate.” Last week, during a press conference with the Irish prime minister, Trump stated: “Nobody is expelling any Palestinians from Gaza.” Meanwhile, the Israeli government has been pushing the idea of a “Gaza exodus” as its plan for the Strip. At the beginning of the month, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that the government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, is working to establish a “migration administration” that will oversee the exodus of Palestinian residents from Gaza. “This plan is taking shape, with ongoing actions in coordination with the administration… It involves identifying key countries, understanding their interests — both with the US and with us — and fostering cooperation,” Smotrich said regarding the initiative and efforts to find countries willing to accept Palestinian emigrants.",Egypt willing to temporarily relocate half a million Gazans to Sinai – report,Nurit Yohanan,The Times of Israel,2025-03-21T08:38:44,2025-03-21T11:52:50,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250321009352315?section=national/diplomacy,"TOKYO, March 21 (Yonhap) -- South Korea and China agreed Friday to work together to restore cultural exchanges, raising expectations Beijing will lift its apparent restrictions on Korean entertainment and other content. The two countries reached the understanding during the bilateral talks between Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Tokyo, Seoul's foreign ministry said in a release following the talks. Friday's talks came as the two Asian neighbors are seeking to manage and improve their bilateral ties as key economic and regional partners despite differences in the security realm. ""The two ministers agreed to work together to ensure that the restoration of cultural exchanges between South Korea and China would enhance mutual understanding between their peoples, and serve as an opportunity to further develop practical cooperation between the two countries,"" the ministry said. Whether the issue of China's restrictions on Korean cultural content, such as K-pop and drama series, would be raised was a point of attention for Friday's talks. Beijing has never acknowledged the imposition officially, but South Korea believes that China placed the ban after Seoul's deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system in 2016. Expectations have grown recently over a possible easing of the measure, amid the two countries' efforts to improve bilateral relations. At the talks, Cho made it clear that South Korea's ""legitimate and lawful"" maritime rights should not be affected by China's activities in the Yellow Sea, the ministry said. Cho's remarks are seen as referring to last month's two-hour standoff between the two countries, when Chinese authorities blocked Seoul's attempt to investigate a steel structure China built in the overlapping waters in the Yellow Sea. Wang, in response, suggested continuing communication between the two sides ""with the recognition that mutual respect for maritime rights is important,"" according to Seoul's ministry. On the possibility of a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea, the two top diplomats agreed to work together to make his trip, if realized, an opportunity for a ""new turning point"" in bilateral relations. Xi is likely to visit South Korea for the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, due to take place in the southeastern city of Gyeongju between late October and early November. ""If President Xi visits, we hope to promote mutually beneficial and practical cooperation projects that will contribute to improving the livelihoods of people in both countries,"" Cho said in the opening remarks. They also agreed to closely cooperate to deepen economic cooperation, including expediting negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement in the service and investment sectors. Cho also asked for China to play a ""constructive role"" in addressing Korean Peninsula issues to encourage North Korea to halt its provocations and move toward denuclearization. The talks between Cho and Wang took place ahead of the planned trilateral meeting involving their Japanese counterpart, Takeshi Iwaya, set for Saturday. Cho arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day. He plans to meet Iwaya for separate bilateral talks following the three-way dialogue. Cho and Wang last held talks on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York in September last year. elly@yna.co.kr(END)","(2nd LD) S.

https://www.politico.eu/article/huawei-brussels-eu-parliament-lobbying-corruption-scandal-china/,"BRUSSELS — The European Union's lobbying scene is rushing to review its ties with Chinese tech company Huawei in the wake of a corruption scandal. European technology association DigitalEurope on Thursday suspended Huawei from its work after Belgian prosecutors last week launched an investigation into ""active corruption"" at the European Parliament benefitting the Chinese tech giant. The powerful industry group BusinessEurope also suspended Huawei as a partner company. Other EU lobby groups and think tanks that have Huawei as a member or received contributions from the company are considering steps too, they told POLITICO. The European Parliament and European Commission already blacklisted Huawei lobbyists last week, shutting off their access to EU premises, and commissioner cabinets and officials working at the EU executive's directorates general were instructed “to immediately suspend contacts and meetings"" with Huawei ""until further notice."" It’s a sign of how Huawei — which is among the top spenders of lobbying money in Brussels according to the EU's transparency register — is suffering major blows after Belgian police raided its main lobbying office in Brussels as part of a larger investigation into corruption, criminal organization and money laundering at the European Parliament.  DigitalEurope is one of Brussels' most powerful technology lobbying voices. It gathers tech companies and national industry associations to influence European Union decision making. The lobby group said in a statement it was aware of the “serious allegations” against Huawei. “We take ethical business conduct and compliance with the law very seriously. As a precautionary measure, Huawei’s membership has been suspended until further notice,” the statement read.  BusinessEurope is a lobbying heavyweight in Brussels, with a membership composed of national trade associations and representing the interests of industrial giants across all sectors. It has a group of ""partner companies"" that includes the world's largest companies. ""Considering the on-going exceptional developments, BusinessEurope has informed Huawei Technologies that its membership to [this] group would not be renewed and would be suspended with immediate effect dated last Friday, March 14 2025,"" the association said in a comment. Huawei is also a member of, or has contributed to, several other lobby groups, trade associations and think tanks, according to the EU's transparency register that lists declarations from organizations looking to lobby the EU's work. Those groups and associations are now all closely monitoring how the case unfolds or gearing up to take action.  The European Internet Forum, a non-profit led by European Parliament members, lists Huawei as a business member. Communications Manager Eusebiu Croitoru said the organization has scheduled a discussion about the investigation and “potential implications for Huawei’s membership,” which will take place April 9. The financial and ethical committee of the European Cyber Security Organization (ECSO) will “soon analyze the situation and possible next steps.” Think tank Bruegel said it is “closely monitoring the situation.” And the Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE) has kept the situation “under close review.” Several of the lobby groups or think tanks contacted by POLITICO said Huawei’s input to their organization or involvement in policy activities was small.  Huawei’s access to sensitive working groups at DigitalEurope was already limited following the security concerns raised over the Chinese tech giant in past years. The company’s contribution to CERRE was “clearly below” 10 percent of the think tank’s budget, it said.  Telecoms lobby group ECTA said that Huawei paid a discounted membership fee and assessed the involvement of Huawei in its activities as “limited,” but added it is “closely monitoring the situation.”  ECSO also said that Huawei had “limited rights” as an associate member. Eurelectric said Huawei is a “business associate,” which means the company is not involved in any policy work, but it added that it is following the reports “closely.” Elisa Braun and Mathieu Pollet contributed reporting.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250321004653315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, March 21 (Yonhap) -- Russia's Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu arrived in North Korea on Friday and was set to meet with leader Kim Jong-un, Russian and North Korean news outlets reported. Leading a delegation from Russia's Security Council, Shoigu arrived in Pyongyang and will meet with Kim and other North Korean officials, according to Tass and the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Kim Jong-gyu, Russian Ambassador Alexandr Matsegora and other officials greeted the delegation, which visited the Liberation Tower and laid a wreath, according to the North's state media. ""The participants paid a silent tribute to the memory of the fallen fighters of the Soviet Army before looking round the tower,"" the KCNA said. The visit marks the latest in a recent series of high-level exchanges between North Korea and Russia, which have grown closer, with Pyongyang deploying thousands of troops to support Moscow in its war against Ukraine. Earlier this month, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko traveled to Pyongyang, where he met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui and discussed arranging ""political contacts at the high and top levels,"" as previously reported by Tass. Appearing on Yonhap News TV in November, South Korea's National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik said the possibility of Kim visiting Russia cannot be ruled out, speculating that if the visit takes place, it could be in the form of reciprocation for Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to North Korea in June last year. At that time, Putin invited Kim to Moscow for summit talks. Russia's Victory Day holiday on May 9, which commemorates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in 1945, is widely speculated to be a potential occasion for Kim's visit to Russia as the country marks the 80th anniversary of its victory this year. The latest visit also comes amid U.S. attempts to broker a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, with U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin agreeing over the phone earlier this week on Russia's temporary halt to strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. During Putin's visit to Pyongyang last year, the two leaders signed a mutual defense treaty, elevating bilateral military cooperation and leading to North Korea's troop deployment to Russia. The deal has sparked international concerns that the two countries' military alignment could lead to Russia transferring rare missile and other high-tech arms technology to North Korea in return for its troop deployment. pbr@yna.co.kr",(3rd LD) Russia's top security official arrives in N.
