https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250321008951315?section=national/diplomacy,"TOKYO, March 22 (Yonhap) -- The top diplomats of South Korea, Japan and China met in Tokyo on Saturday for talks expected to focus on advancing trilateral cooperation, amid economic and security uncertainties from the second U.S. administration of President Donald Trump. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for the three-way dialogue, as the three Asian neighbors are seeking to hold a leaders' summit later this year. In Saturday's talks, the ministers are expected to broadly discuss efforts to advance the tripartite partnership in economy, culture, and people-to-people exchanges, as well as regional and global issues, including those related to the Korean Peninsula. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul (R) poses for a photo with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya (C) and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on March 21, 2025, as they arrived for a dinner reception at a hotel in Tokyo, where the three ministers have gathered for trilateral talks. (Yonhap) ""Peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula are essential for the peace and prosperity of East Asia and the world,"" Cho said in the opening remarks. ""I hope to have a candid discussion on the North Korean nuclear issue today."" Cho said the three-way talks will ""reaffirm commitment to continued cooperation and deepen future collaboration."" Iwaya highlighted the need for the three countries to ""overcome conflict and division through dialogue and cooperation."" ""While the three neighbors face difficulties, it's highly important to have candid conversations and pursue forward-looking exchanges at the same time,"" he said. Wang called the three-way cooperation the ""most promising"" framework for development in East Asia, saying the three sides are working to resume negotiations for the free trade agreement at an early date. The three ministers are scheduled to hold a joint press conference following the talks. Cho will join Iwaya for separate bilateral talks on the same day. Cho arrived in Japan Friday and met one-on-one with Wang on the same day. At Saturday's talks, the three sides are also expected to coordinate efforts to facilitate a successful summit of the countries' leaders. Japan is the host for this year's gathering, widely expected to take place later this year. They could also discuss ways the three Asian neighbors can cooperate in the context of growing uncertainties and challenges posed by Trump's trade policies amid the rivalry between Washington and Beijing. On security issues, they are likely to exchange assessments on North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations and Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine. The three Asian neighbors held their last foreign ministers' dialogue in South Korea's southern city of Busan in November 2023, attended by Wang and then Foreign Ministers Park Jin and Yoko Kamikawa. The previous three-way summit took place in Seoul in May last year between President Yoon Suk Yeol, then Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang. elly@yna.co.kr(END)","(LEAD) Top diplomats of S.

https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-03-21/mexican-auschwitz-opens-its-doors-the-only-truth-is-that-they-dont-care-about-the-missing.html,"The ranch of horror has opened its doors. The “Mexican Auschwitz,” as it has come to be known, is a compound in the middle of harvested sugarcane fields, accessible through a black iron gate riddled with bullet holes. Inside, there is little to see: a barren field with four dusty palm trees, filthy bathrooms, and three sheds with tin roofs. On March 5, a group of people searching for their missing relatives entered unannounced and discovered human skeletal remains, signs of cremations, hundreds of items of clothing, toiletries, and even toys. But the image that has shocked the public and evoked comparisons to Nazi atrocities is the pile of abandoned shoes that was found. The Izaguirre ranch in Teuchitlán, in the Mexican state of Jalisco, is one of the many training camps used by organized crime to recruit young people to their cause. It is also known that these recruits are subjected to the cruelest practices to strip them of any fear of using knives and guns, even forcing them to kill one another. Many of the thousands of people who have disappeared in Mexico have fallen into the hands of cartels. And it is no longer known whether they are alive or dead. Several groups of searchers from Jalisco, as well as from other states, visited the ranch on Thursday. Muffled cries were heard, faded by the shock, but above all, there was despair as it became clear that there was no more evidence inside. “Why did they bring us here?” asked one person. “This is a mockery,” said another. “The only truth is that they don’t care about the missing,” one individual told the press, which was also granted access to the ranch for the first time. The Jalisco Prosecutor’s Office, at the request of the Attorney General’s Office, chartered seven buses and transported dozens of journalists, who jostled at the doors of the ranch in the stifling heat. Inside, the searchers scoured through the dirt floor with their feet and found a few socks, a blue Adidas backpack, a gold-handled razor, and some toothbrushes. “This is how they search for clues,” one of them sarcastically remarked before several microphones. The shock from the macabre discovery on March 5 was followed by disbelief at the sloppy work of the Jalisco State Prosecutor’s Office. The authorities had entered the ranch last September, arrested 10 people, rescued two, and recovered a body — but little else. The site was supposedly sealed off, yet in the months following that operation, two vehicles were stolen from the location. It was left virtually abandoned. Little to nothing is known about the survivors; no statements were taken, no fingerprints were collected, and no questions were raised about the owners of the ranch, located just a few miles from Guadalajara, one of Mexico’s wealthiest cities. All of this has been publicly condemned by Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero. This kind of negligence is attributed to either fear of organized crime or collusion with it, and such failures of law enforcement are common across the country. The Attorney General’s Office has since taken over the case, removing all clothes, shoes, and items, which have been displayed to the public in the hopes that they will be identified by the relatives of the missing. However, the outrage over the state’s handling of the investigation is overwhelming. So many missed opportunities. The ranch is now fully dug up, with excavations made in the ground to search for clues. In some of the holes, red flags indicate “positive” results, while in certain corners, there are mounds of ash. The ranch has been opened to the public, but information remains scarce or nonexistent. How many young men and women passed through there, how long ago, who survived, whose bones were found, what exactly happened there, and since when? There is nothing to report while the Prosecutor’s Office conducts its investigation, but it has already been made clear that the initial team responsible for gathering evidence failed, and the searchers fear that, once again, they’ll pass the buck and the case will be closed without any results. It is assumed that the brutal training camp was controlled by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which dominates the area, but even that remains uncertain. On the unpaved floor of one of the sheds lie rudimentary weights made from two rusty cans filled with cement. On the wall, there are other metal objects that also seemed to be intended for physical exercise. “They want them strong,” says a woman involved in the search, referring to the forced recruitment by criminal organizations. Beside her, a young woman wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the image of her missing loved one finds no solace, sitting on the cobblestones and embracing her friends from the bus. In Mexico, 124,000 people have been officially missing for several decades. The earliest cases were victims of the state itself, during what became known as the Dirty War, when the military and police took away people who opposed the regime. The missing people of today are victims of organized crime. Some voluntarily join their ranks, while others are abducted daily from neighborhoods, streets, and highways, never to be seen again. Some may be dead, but others may have endured the horrific indoctrination in these camps and turned into criminals themselves. All of them are being searched for by their mothers.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/khamenei-says-houthis-act-independently-warns-against-us-strikes-on-iran/,"Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said Friday that the Houthis, an Iran-aligned terror group that controls much of Yemen, act on their own motivations, after US President Donald Trump said he would hold Tehran accountable for the group’s actions. Khamenei also warned, “If the US or anyone else commits any malicious act against Iran, they will receive a severe blow,” in comments made in a televised speech, echoed by official social media posts. Trump said Monday that he would hold Iran responsible for any attacks carried out by the Houthis, as the American military carried out waves of strikes against the group, marking the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since he returned to the White House. The Houthis, whose slogan calls for “death to America, death to Israel, [and] a curse on the Jews,” have fired four missiles at Israel since Tuesday, all of which were intercepted, and none of which caused any casualties. The group resumed its attacks on Israel after fighting resumed in the Gaza Strip, amid the collapse of a hostage-ceasefire deal with the Hamas terror group. Americans, said Khamenei on Friday, “make a big mistake and call regional resistance centers Iranian proxies. What does proxy mean?” “The Yemeni nation has its own motivation and the resistance groups in the region have their own motivations. Iran doesn’t need proxies,” Khamenei said. The US “issue threats,” he added, but “we have never started a confrontation or conflict with anyone. However, if anyone acts with malice and initiates it, they will receive severe slaps.” Over the years, Iran has been aligned with groups across the region that describe themselves as the “Axis of Resistance” to Israel and US influence. Those groups include Hamas, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and various Shiite terror groups in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic Republic also counted the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad — ousted by Islamist rebels in December — as an ally. The Houthis began attacking ships in the Red Sea in November 2023, a month after Hamas stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza. While the Houthis have said they were attacking Israeli-linked shipping in support of Gaza, they have also targeted vessels with no known Israeli connections. The Iran-backed rebels also fired some 40 ballistic missiles at Israel, from November 2023 until just days before the Gaza hostage-ceasefire deal was reached in January 2025. They also launched several attack drones at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July. Responding to the attacks, Israel has carried out several strikes on Houthi sites in Yemen.","Khamenei says Houthis act independently, warns against US strikes on Iran","Agencies, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-03-21T12:02:39,2025-03-21T12:02:39,gemini-2.0-flash

There are no immediate reports of injuries or damage in the attack. The IDF says the missile was shot down before crossing the country’s borders.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-willing-to-temporarily-relocate-half-a-million-gazans-to-sinai-report/,"Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has informed other Arab leaders that he is willing to temporarily relocate half a million residents from Gaza to northern Sinai in a designated city as part of the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, according to a Friday report. According to the report in the Lebanese Al-Akhbar newspaper, Sissi made his willingness known during meetings held by Arab leaders in recent weeks in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. There was no confirmation of the report from any other source. The	Egyptian State Information Service denied the report, saying, “Egypt’s position is firm in its absolute and final rejection of any attempt to displace Palestinians, and the Cairo Arab Summit’s emergency plan for reconstruction is based on it.” In public statements, Sissi and Jordan’s King Abdullah have repeatedly rebuffed US President Donald Trump’s assertion that the two Arab countries could take in Palestinian refugees on a permanent basis under his plan to empty the Gaza Strip of its residents and turn it into a “riviera.” The issue is of crucial significance for Jordan and Egypt, which fear that an influx of Palestinians will destabilize their countries. Throughout the recent two-month ceasefire between Hamas and Israel — which collapsed this week — Arab leaders held several summits regarding Gaza and their vision for “the day after the war.” At an Arab League summit in Cairo in early March, Egypt presented its plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and emphasized that it would not include the displacement of residents. The Arab plan envisions an independent committee of technocrats governing Gaza for six months before handing control to the Palestinian Authority.	The plan does not mention Hamas by name, instead stating that the fate of all armed groups in Gaza can only be fully addressed through a political process that leads to a Palestinian state. According to previous reports in Arab media, the plan only includes the internal relocation of Gazans within Gaza to clear rubble and rebuild buildings and neighborhoods. According to a United Nations analysis from September, over two-thirds of Gaza’s structures have been damaged or destroyed during the war sparked on October 7, 2023, when Hamas rampaged through southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 hostages. Recently, the Trump administration has been sending mixed signals regarding its stance on the Egypt-led Arab plan for post-war Gaza. Initially, Trump spoke multiple times about his vision of emptying Gaza of its more than 2 million Palestinian residents and reconstructing the Strip, even suggesting that Israel would hand Gaza over to the US after the war. Then, on March 7, US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, called the Arab proposal a “good-faith first step” with “a lot of compelling features.” Hours later, however, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce characterized the proposal as “inadequate.” Last week, during a press conference with the Irish prime minister, Trump stated: “Nobody is expelling any Palestinians from Gaza.” Meanwhile, the Israeli government has been pushing the idea of a “Gaza exodus” as its plan for the Strip. At the beginning of the month, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that the government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, is working to establish a “migration administration” that will oversee the exodus of Palestinian residents from Gaza. “This plan is taking shape, with ongoing actions in coordination with the administration… It involves identifying key countries, understanding their interests — both with the US and with us — and fostering cooperation,” Smotrich said regarding the initiative and efforts to find countries willing to accept Palestinian emigrants.",Egypt willing to temporarily relocate half a million Gazans to Sinai – report,Nurit Yohanan,The Times of Israel,2025-03-21T08:38:44,2025-03-21T11:52:50,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250321009352315?section=national/diplomacy,"TOKYO, March 21 (Yonhap) -- South Korea and China agreed Friday to work together to restore cultural exchanges, raising expectations Beijing will lift its apparent restrictions on Korean entertainment and other content. The two countries reached the understanding during the bilateral talks between Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Tokyo, Seoul's foreign ministry said in a release following the talks. Friday's talks came as the two Asian neighbors are seeking to manage and improve their bilateral ties as key economic and regional partners despite differences in the security realm. ""The two ministers agreed to work together to ensure that the restoration of cultural exchanges between South Korea and China would enhance mutual understanding between their peoples, and serve as an opportunity to further develop practical cooperation between the two countries,"" the ministry said. Whether the issue of China's restrictions on Korean cultural content, such as K-pop and drama series, would be raised was a point of attention for Friday's talks. Beijing has never acknowledged the imposition officially, but South Korea believes that China placed the ban after Seoul's deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system in 2016. Expectations have grown recently over a possible easing of the measure, amid the two countries' efforts to improve bilateral relations. At the talks, Cho made it clear that South Korea's ""legitimate and lawful"" maritime rights should not be affected by China's activities in the Yellow Sea, the ministry said. Cho's remarks are seen as referring to last month's two-hour standoff between the two countries, when Chinese authorities blocked Seoul's attempt to investigate a steel structure China built in the overlapping waters in the Yellow Sea. Wang, in response, suggested continuing communication between the two sides ""with the recognition that mutual respect for maritime rights is important,"" according to Seoul's ministry. On the possibility of a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea, the two top diplomats agreed to work together to make his trip, if realized, an opportunity for a ""new turning point"" in bilateral relations. Xi is likely to visit South Korea for the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, due to take place in the southeastern city of Gyeongju between late October and early November. ""If President Xi visits, we hope to promote mutually beneficial and practical cooperation projects that will contribute to improving the livelihoods of people in both countries,"" Cho said in the opening remarks. They also agreed to closely cooperate to deepen economic cooperation, including expediting negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement in the service and investment sectors. Cho also asked for China to play a ""constructive role"" in addressing Korean Peninsula issues to encourage North Korea to halt its provocations and move toward denuclearization. The talks between Cho and Wang took place ahead of the planned trilateral meeting involving their Japanese counterpart, Takeshi Iwaya, set for Saturday. Cho arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day. He plans to meet Iwaya for separate bilateral talks following the three-way dialogue. Cho and Wang last held talks on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York in September last year. elly@yna.co.kr(END)","(2nd LD) S.

https://www.politico.eu/article/huawei-brussels-eu-parliament-lobbying-corruption-scandal-china/,"BRUSSELS — The European Union's lobbying scene is rushing to review its ties with Chinese tech company Huawei in the wake of a corruption scandal. European technology association DigitalEurope on Thursday suspended Huawei from its work after Belgian prosecutors last week launched an investigation into ""active corruption"" at the European Parliament benefitting the Chinese tech giant. The powerful industry group BusinessEurope also suspended Huawei as a partner company. Other EU lobby groups and think tanks that have Huawei as a member or received contributions from the company are considering steps too, they told POLITICO. The European Parliament and European Commission already blacklisted Huawei lobbyists last week, shutting off their access to EU premises, and commissioner cabinets and officials working at the EU executive's directorates general were instructed “to immediately suspend contacts and meetings"" with Huawei ""until further notice."" It’s a sign of how Huawei — which is among the top spenders of lobbying money in Brussels according to the EU's transparency register — is suffering major blows after Belgian police raided its main lobbying office in Brussels as part of a larger investigation into corruption, criminal organization and money laundering at the European Parliament.  DigitalEurope is one of Brussels' most powerful technology lobbying voices. It gathers tech companies and national industry associations to influence European Union decision making. The lobby group said in a statement it was aware of the “serious allegations” against Huawei. “We take ethical business conduct and compliance with the law very seriously. As a precautionary measure, Huawei’s membership has been suspended until further notice,” the statement read.  BusinessEurope is a lobbying heavyweight in Brussels, with a membership composed of national trade associations and representing the interests of industrial giants across all sectors. It has a group of ""partner companies"" that includes the world's largest companies. ""Considering the on-going exceptional developments, BusinessEurope has informed Huawei Technologies that its membership to [this] group would not be renewed and would be suspended with immediate effect dated last Friday, March 14 2025,"" the association said in a comment. Huawei is also a member of, or has contributed to, several other lobby groups, trade associations and think tanks, according to the EU's transparency register that lists declarations from organizations looking to lobby the EU's work. Those groups and associations are now all closely monitoring how the case unfolds or gearing up to take action.  The European Internet Forum, a non-profit led by European Parliament members, lists Huawei as a business member. Communications Manager Eusebiu Croitoru said the organization has scheduled a discussion about the investigation and “potential implications for Huawei’s membership,” which will take place April 9. The financial and ethical committee of the European Cyber Security Organization (ECSO) will “soon analyze the situation and possible next steps.” Think tank Bruegel said it is “closely monitoring the situation.” And the Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE) has kept the situation “under close review.” Several of the lobby groups or think tanks contacted by POLITICO said Huawei’s input to their organization or involvement in policy activities was small.  Huawei’s access to sensitive working groups at DigitalEurope was already limited following the security concerns raised over the Chinese tech giant in past years. The company’s contribution to CERRE was “clearly below” 10 percent of the think tank’s budget, it said.  Telecoms lobby group ECTA said that Huawei paid a discounted membership fee and assessed the involvement of Huawei in its activities as “limited,” but added it is “closely monitoring the situation.”  ECSO also said that Huawei had “limited rights” as an associate member. Eurelectric said Huawei is a “business associate,” which means the company is not involved in any policy work, but it added that it is following the reports “closely.” Elisa Braun and Mathieu Pollet contributed reporting.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250321004653315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, March 21 (Yonhap) -- Russia's Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu arrived in North Korea on Friday and was set to meet with leader Kim Jong-un, Russian and North Korean news outlets reported. Leading a delegation from Russia's Security Council, Shoigu arrived in Pyongyang and will meet with Kim and other North Korean officials, according to Tass and the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Kim Jong-gyu, Russian Ambassador Alexandr Matsegora and other officials greeted the delegation, which visited the Liberation Tower and laid a wreath, according to the North's state media. ""The participants paid a silent tribute to the memory of the fallen fighters of the Soviet Army before looking round the tower,"" the KCNA said. The visit marks the latest in a recent series of high-level exchanges between North Korea and Russia, which have grown closer, with Pyongyang deploying thousands of troops to support Moscow in its war against Ukraine. Earlier this month, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko traveled to Pyongyang, where he met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui and discussed arranging ""political contacts at the high and top levels,"" as previously reported by Tass. Appearing on Yonhap News TV in November, South Korea's National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik said the possibility of Kim visiting Russia cannot be ruled out, speculating that if the visit takes place, it could be in the form of reciprocation for Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to North Korea in June last year. At that time, Putin invited Kim to Moscow for summit talks. Russia's Victory Day holiday on May 9, which commemorates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in 1945, is widely speculated to be a potential occasion for Kim's visit to Russia as the country marks the 80th anniversary of its victory this year. The latest visit also comes amid U.S. attempts to broker a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, with U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin agreeing over the phone earlier this week on Russia's temporary halt to strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. During Putin's visit to Pyongyang last year, the two leaders signed a mutual defense treaty, elevating bilateral military cooperation and leading to North Korea's troop deployment to Russia. The deal has sparked international concerns that the two countries' military alignment could lead to Russia transferring rare missile and other high-tech arms technology to North Korea in return for its troop deployment. pbr@yna.co.kr",(3rd LD) Russia's top security official arrives in N.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-fires-shin-bet-chief-pm-claims-lack-of-trust-in-bar-who-calls-move-invalid/,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet voted unanimously in the early hours of Friday morning to dismiss Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, the premier’s office announced. Bar’s final day will be April 10, with the government moving up his dismissal after initially scheduling it for April 20, though Netanyahu’s office said Bar could be gone before then if ministers approve a permanent replacement. The move marked the first time in Israeli history that the government has fired the head of the domestic security agency. Netanyahu told the cabinet in a meeting that started late Thursday night that he lost faith in Bar after the October 7, 2023, Hamas assault on southern Israel. Bar is “soft” and “not the right person to rehabilitate the organization,” Netanyahu said, according to his office. “I have been managing diplomatic negotiations for many years,” continued Netanyahu. “He had a soft approach and was not aggressive enough.” He claimed that since replacing Bar on the negotiating team with another senior Shin Bet official, “the leaks have decreased dramatically, and through very successful negotiations we have managed to return the hostages.” The currently lapsed ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas was signed in January, weeks before Netanyahu removed Bar from the negotiating team, which has not secured the release of any additional hostages since then. As ministers deliberated, the Shin Bet circulated a letter Bar sent to the cabinet explaining why he wouldn’t attend the meeting and disputing the arguments ostensibly justifying his dismissal. He blasted the government’s “unfounded claims that are nothing more than a cover for completely different, extraneous and fundamentally invalid motives designed to disrupt the ability of the Shin Bet to fulfill its role.” He warned that Netanyahu was taking steps that weaken the country “both internally and against its enemies.” Saying that he and Netanyahu worked effectively to bring about January’s hostage release deal with Hamas and a series of operational successes on Israel’s southern and northern war fronts, Bar said there was no basis for the premier’s insistence that there is no trust between them, “except if the real intention, which I apparently failed to understand, was to negotiate without reaching a deal.” He added that Netanyahu’s decision to remove him and Mossad chief David Barnea from the hostage negotiations “harmed the team and did not advance the release at all.” Turning to “Qatargate” — what Bar called the “ongoing complex, extensive, and highly sensitive investigation currently underway into Qatar’s involvement in the heart of Israeli decision-making, the Prime Minister’s Office” — the Shin Bet chief said that completing the investigation in full was “a public duty of the highest order.” Dismissing the Shin Bet head during the investigation, Bar argued, was tainted with “extraneous considerations and a personal and institutional conflict of interest that could not be more serious.” It risked jeopardizing the investigation, he said, and called this a danger to the country’s security. He also pushed for a state commission of inquiry into October 7, a powerhouse probe led by a retired Supreme Court justice that Netanyahu has rejected: “The urgent national need for such an investigation cannot be subordinated to the personal considerations of those involved in the matter, as it is the only way to ensure that such a multi-system failure will not occur again,” Bar wrote. Bar also said the cabinet meeting was convened in contradiction of Israel’s laws and against the attorney general’s position. “My decision not to attend the government meeting stems solely from my understanding that this is a discussion that is not in accordance with the provisions of the law and the rules concerning the termination of the term of office of any employee, let alone one holding a senior position, and the position of head of the Shin Bet in particular,” he explained. “A substantive response to such claims requires an orderly process, including the presentation of relevant documents, and not a seemingly premeditated process whose outcome is predetermined,” said Bar. Conspiracy peddling Responding to Bar’s letter while the cabinet meeting was in progress, an “Israeli official” accused the spy chief of doing nothing to stop the Hamas October 7, 2023, attack even though, the official claimed, Bar knew it was going to happen beforehand. “Ronen Bar preferred not to attend the government meeting dealing with his case, simply because he was afraid of giving answers,” said the official, whom Channel 12 identified as Netanyahu himself, “and especially of answering one question — Why, after you knew about the Hamas attack many hours before it happened, did you do nothing and did not call the Prime Minister – something that would have prevented the disaster?” “If Ronen Bar carried out his role like he is now clinging on to his job, we would not have reached October 7,” the official charged. The official also accused Bar of “clinging to his seat while cynically exploiting the families of the hostages and using his position politically to fabricate futile, unfounded investigations.” Netanyahu has sought to shift the responsibility for the colossal failure onto the shoulders of the security establishment, arguing he was not woken up in the hours before the invasion when signs of impending attack were being picked up by Israel’s intelligence services, while denying he bought into the “conception” that Hamas was more interested in governing Gaza than attacking Israel. Netanyahu had for years placated the terror group with policies sending Qatari funds into Gaza, issuing work permits for Gazans and ordering limited responses to attacks. In their probes into the Hamas invasion, both the IDF and Shin Bet have acknowledged colossal failures surrounding October 7. The IDF’s investigations have established that it identified several signs of unusual Hamas activity the night before the terror group’s October 7 onslaught, but believed they did not indicate an imminent attack. The Shin Bet’s probe, only a summation of which has been published, acknowledged gaps in the “handling of information and integration of intelligence” as one of several factors contributing to the agency’s failure to issue an alert in the hours before the invasion. If the Shin Bet had acted differently, in the years leading up to the attack and during the night of the attack — both at the professional level and the managerial level — the massacre would have been avoided. This is not the standard we expected of ourselves, or that the public expected of us,” Bar wrote when the summation was released. The unfounded allegation that the military and security agencies had advance knowledge of the Hamas attack and deliberately ignored it, facilitating the Hamas massacre, has been peddled online, including by pro-Netanyahu conspiracy theorists, since soon after October 7, but not hitherto directly advanced by the prime minister. Fifty-one percent of Israelis oppose the firing of Bar, compared to 32% who back his dismissal, according to a Channel 12 opinion poll, published while the cabinet met. Forty-six percent say they trust Bar more than they trust Netanyahu, while 32% trust Netanyahu more than Bar. Unanimous vote, immediate petition “The main reason as to why I will vote in favor of removing the head of the Shin Bet from his position is his responsibility for the October 7th failure, a responsibility that he explicitly acknowledged,” said Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. He noted that many other senior defense and security officials have stepped down over the calamity, the worst attack in Israel’s history and deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, which Netanyahu and members of his government have refused to similarly resign over for failing to prevent. Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter of Likud, a former head of the Shin Bet, explained his vote to dismiss Bar by pointing to the importance of trust between the prime minister and the spymaster. “Unlike an institution that has operational aspects, the Shin Bet also has personal aspects related to the prime minister,” said Dichter, “The Shin Bet chief is responsible for the prime minister’s personal security.” “In a situation of a lack of confidence, there are two options: either the Shin Bet chief resigns, or he is fired. And if he does not resign, then he is fired.” National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, meanwhile, claimed Bar is a “direct threat to democracy,” according to Hebrew-language media reports. Ben Gvir, who has previously been convicted of incitement and supporting a terrorist organization, has long railed at Bar for warning about settler violence in the West Bank and the far-right minister’s actions on the flashpoint Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City. Minutes after the unanimous vote to fire Bar, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel said it had filed a High Court of Justice petition against the dismissal, which opposition figures panned even as ministers deliberated it. National Unity leader Benny Gantz said the decision to fire Bar was politically motivated and constituted a “mark of Cain on every government minister who raised his hand tonight, and will be remembered with eternal shame.” The Democrats leader Yair Golan said that Bar’s letter to the cabinet was “an unprecedented indictment.” Yisrael Beytenu party leader Avigdor Liberman tore into the government for voting to fire Bar “amid a war against all our enemies.” “The prime minister of October 7 [Benjamin Netanyahu] is doing exactly what our enemies dream of — fighting the Shin Bet head,” Liberman said. “[Netanyahu] needed to take responsibility after the disaster, resign first and demand all those to blame for the failure join him.” Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said the government was dismissing Bar “for one reason alone: To stop the Qatargate investigation.” “Opposition parties will together appeal this reckless step that is meant to whitewash a hostile state’s penetration into the prime minister’s office,” Lapid charged. Stormy demonstrations Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who was present for the vote and opposed the decision, had previously warned Netanyahu that he could not fire Bar before her office reviewed his motives for doing so, amid the Shin Bet investigation into the premier’s aides and their alleged ties to Qatar. The move to fire Bar, announced by Netanyahu on Sunday, sparked mass protests across the country, with critics fearing that the prime minister is seeking to replace Bar with a loyalist who will quash the Shin Bet’s ongoing Qatar probe, as well as politicize the government’s hold over the country’s security apparatuses. Thousands of people protested on Thursday night in front of Netanyahu’s office as the cabinet met. Appearing as a sea of umbrellas in the driving rain, the demonstrators marched from Netanyahu’s residence to the nearby office while chanting, “We will never give up,” capping off a day of protests that saw clashes with police who in some cases used water cannons on protesters. Some demonstrators protested by blocking the entrance to the Prime Minister’s Office with their cars ahead of the cabinet meeting. Footage showed policemen smashing the windows of the cars while passengers were inside to remove them. Netanyahu has insisted the investigation into the hundreds of thousands of dollars that his aides allegedly received from Qatar, which the attorney general ordered be opened last month, was politically motivated. Before the vote to fire Bar was scheduled, police on Wednesday evening detained and questioned two suspects in the case, who have not been named. Baharav-Miara, who the government is also moving to oust — with reports suggesting a vote to dismiss her could be held as early as Sunday — had said the premier could not fire Bar unless he consulted her and established a “factual and legal basis” for doing so. Netanyahu responded by accusing Baharav-Miara of “abusing her authority.” After Netanyahu’s office announced Thursday night’s vote, the government pushed off a previously scheduled cabinet meeting on the resumption of the Gaza war until next week. Although Bar has expressed his intention to eventually resign over his agency’s failure to anticipate the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack, he had been pushing back against the prime minister’s efforts to oust him, fearing that acquiescence would allow Netanyahu to appoint a loyalist in his stead. The Shin Bet head was reportedly planning to remain in his post until all the hostages were returned from Gaza and a state commission of inquiry was established to probe the failures surrounding October 7. According to a Channel 12 news report Wednesday, the leading candidates to replace Bar are the Shin Bet’s recently departed deputy chief, known only by his first initial “Mem,” and “Resh,” who was previously considered for the post. The network reported that former senior Shin Bet official Shalom Ben Hanan was also under consideration.","Cabinet fires Shin Bet chief; PM claims lack of trust in Bar, who calls move invalid",Lazar Berman,The Times of Israel,2025-03-21T01:39:35,2025-03-21T01:39:35,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250321000200315?section=national/diplomacy,"WASHINGTON, March 20 (Yonhap) -- Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun pledged utmost efforts Thursday to remove South Korea from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s ""sensitive country"" list, while noting Seoul's plan to seek a ""constructive alternative"" should the country's designation not be reversed. Ahn plans to meet Energy Secretary Chris Wright on the day to discuss South Korea's placement on the ""Sensitive and Other Designated Countries List (SCL)."" He is also set to have talks with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick over tariff issues on Friday. ""Although we will engage in consultations in a direction toward the deletion (of South Korea) from the list as much as we can, but if that is not possible, we will seek to craft a constructive alternative,"" Ahn told reporters upon arrival at Dulles International Airport near Washington. ""We will make our utmost efforts to find an optimal option to ensure that science, technology and industrial cooperation between South Korea and the United States will not be hindered,"" he added. Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun speaks to the press upon arrival at Dulles International Airport near Washington on March 20, 2025. (Yonhap) The DOE confirmed last week that the preceding Biden administration added South Korea to the SCL in early January -- a list that includes North Korea, China and Russia. The designation is set to take effect April 15. Officials of the designated countries are subject to stricter scrutiny when access is requested to DOE research institutions or other facilities for technology cooperation or other purposes. The designation has drawn keen media attention in Seoul as many Koreans apparently view the juxtaposition of their country alongside North Korea, China and Russia in the SCL as a matter of trust in the long-standing alliance with the U.S. Asked if there is a chance that South Korea will be taken out from the list before April 15, Ahn said that he needs to examine exactly what is going on with regards to the list during planned talks with U.S. officials. He also elaborated on what alternative Seoul is considering. ""The U.S. side is talking about procedural issues (regarding the listing),"" he said. ""We are trying to find an alternative that can make sure that those procedural matters would not become impediments (to bilateral cooperation) as much as possible."" He pointed out the U.S. government's position that there is no serious problem in bilateral science and technology cooperation. Another focus of his trip is on President Donald Trump's plan to roll out ""reciprocal"" tariffs on April 2, which will be customized on a country-by-country basis based on countries' tariff- and non-tariff barriers and other factors, including exchange rates. ""There have been virtually no tariffs between the two countries under a bilateral free trade agreement. But there are various non-tariff issues being raised. Efforts are underway to swiftly address part of them domestically (in Korea),"" he said. ""During my visit this time, I will explain these matters, and we are in communication with them over with what plans we will resolve issues where the U.S. has concerns."" Asked whether South Korea is in the so-called Dirty-15 group of countries, Ahn refused to ""prejudge."" This week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent mentioned Dirty-15 countries with high tariffs on U.S. goods, but he did not elaborate. ""We have been consulting steadily. We are now in a situation where we need to craft a framework to minimize any negative impact on South Korean industrial sectors,"" he said. sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)",Industry minister vows utmost efforts to remove S.

https://apnews.com/article/eu-defense-funds-weapons-ukraine-ammunition-russia-d472d36e583f1bd7ebf54e5826b9e752,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin’s key peace demand that Western allies stop providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine is quietly being ignored by the European Union. As U.S.-led talks with Russia and Ukraine progress, without the Europeans at the table, the 27-nation bloc is pressing ahead with a steel “porcupine strategy” aimed at building the Ukrainian armed forces, and the country’s defense industry, into an even more formidable opponent. At an EU summit on Thursday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that it’s “central” that Ukraine should remain an independent democratic nation that can continue its journey toward EU membership and “that it also has a strong army of its own after a peace agreement.” “For us, it will be important to continue to support Ukraine significantly — as the European Union as a whole, as allies and friends and as individual countries,” Scholz told reporters in Brussels. A few hours after he spoke, Scholz’s EU counterparts — with the exception of Hungary, which opposes the bloc’s “peace through strength” stance — called on member countries “to urgently step up efforts to address Ukraine’s pressing military and defence needs.” Mindful of Russian deception in the past — the “little green men” who annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, or the troop buildup in 2021 that Moscow denied would lead to any invasion — the Europeans are deeply skeptical about Putin’s intentions and whether he would accept any peace terms. With the U.K. and other partners, some European countries are working on a deterrence force to police any future peace. At the same time, Ukraine’s best security guarantee, apart from the NATO membership that the U.S. refuses, is that its own army is strong and well supplied. In a defense blueprint unveiled on Wednesday, the European Commission set out how it plans to meet Ukraine’s security needs, with EU money available to help bolster its defense industry, which produces arms and ammunition more cheaply and closer to the battlefield. “Ukraine is currently the front line of European defense, resisting a war of aggression driven by the single greatest threat to our common security,” the document says. “The outcome of that war will be a determinative factor in our collective future for decades ahead.” At the heart of the EU’s strategy is a commitment to provide air defense systems and missiles — including long-range precision warheads. In groups, countries would jointly purchase the equipment and financially back Ukraine’s own effort to obtain them. Drones are a major advantage on the battlefield, and the EU intends to back Ukraine’s procurement of them and help it build its own production capacity, including through joint ventures between European and Ukrainian industries. Another aim is to provide at least 2 million rounds of large-caliber artillery shells each year, and to continue a training effort that has helped to prepare more than 75,000 Ukrainian troops so far. In return, European troops will learn from Ukraine’s front-line experience. Ukraine would also be able to take part in the EU’s space program, with access to the services provided by national governments in the area of global positioning, navigation, surveillance and communications. Financially, and beyond the estimated 138 billion euros ($150 billion) already provided to Ukraine, the government in Kyiv would be able to secure cheap loans for defense purposes — as can EU countries and Norway — from a new fund worth 150 billion euros ($162 billion). ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at ",EU presses on with steel 'porcupine strategy' for Ukraine as Russia tries to end Western support,Lorne Cook,AP News,2025-03-20T14:13:19,2025-03-20T19:21:04,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250321000400315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, March 21 (Yonhap) -- North Korea has successfully test-fired its latest anti-aircraft missile system, which was recently put into full-scale production, as leader Kim Jong-un oversaw the test, the North's state media reported Friday. The test-firing was conducted by the country's Missile Administration on Thursday to ""examine the comprehensive performance"" of the missile system being mass-produced at a munitions' industry enterprise, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) noted. Kim oversaw the test alongside key members of the party's Central Military Commission, the KCNA said, claiming that it proved the missile's combat fast response is ""advantageous"" and ""highly reliable."" Photos released alongside the report showed what appeared to be a launched missile hitting a target and exploding, and Kim smiled contentedly apparently at the test result. Kim said the country's army will be equipped with ""another major defense weapons system with laudable combat performance,"" expressing gratitude to the research group in charge and relevant munitions industry enterprise for strengthening national defense capability, the KCNA said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgz8jlxlk3o,"The potential Western troop deployment to Ukraine being discussed in London should be described as a ""reassurance force"" rather than a ""peacekeeping force"", defence and diplomatic sources say. Currently dubbed the Multinational Force Ukraine or MFU, it would be sent to the country to cement any ceasefire and encourage long-term confidence in the country. The focus would be on providing Ukraine with air cover to keep its skies safe and a naval presence in the Black Sea to encourage trade. The deployment of so-called ""boots on the ground"" - probably about 20,000 strong - would in terms of size not be big enough to enforce any peace. Instead, the troops - provided by a so-called ""coalition of the willing"" - would most likely be deployed to protect cities, ports and major energy infrastructure. One option being considered is that the MFU might not operate in the east of Ukraine near the front line to try to reassure Russia it poses no offensive threat. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin have said repeatedly they would not agree any ceasefire if European and other forces were deployed to Ukraine. The sources say any multinational operation in Ukraine would not be a ""peacekeeping force"" and should not be described as such. Peacekeeping forces - under the aegis of either the United Nations or Nato - traditionally are impartial, operate with the consent of both parties and use force only to defend themselves. The multinational force being discussed would very much be on Ukraine's side, there to help deter future Russian aggression. At the moment, it is not expected that the multinational force on the ground would monitor any ceasefire. That would be done by Ukrainian troops on the frontline and Western surveillance assets in the air and space. The sources also say the coalition troops would not be deployed to provide a so-called ""tripwire force"" - meaning a force smaller than that of the opponent, designed to deter an attack without triggering escalation - if Russia resumed its invasion of Ukraine. They say the military impact of any allied deployment of about 20,000 troops would be limited compared to the number of troops on either side of the front line. Ukraine has almost a million military personnel, Russia's army is even larger. Much of the focus of Thursday's discussions is on how best any international force can provide Ukraine with assets it does not have, especially capability in the air. So, there will be discussions about which countries can provide warplanes to keep Ukraine's skies safe during a ceasefire. There will also be discussions about how to make the Black Sea safe for shipping. That may involve two components: how best to keep shipping lanes clear of mines and what kind of naval task force could provide a security presence in the sea. The key uncertainty is whether the United States would provide any air, satellite or intelligence cover for any European force on the ground. The US has thus far said it would not be willing to provide any military ""backstop"". The European strategy for now is to stop asking the US and instead organise the best force and capability it can to ensure the security of Ukraine in the future. Once the details are agreed, then the UK, France and others would see if the European offer was substantial enough for the US to have a change of heart and agree to play some kind of role. What all this planning depends on, of course, is some kind of ceasefire being agreed in Ukraine. While the US remains optimistic, many in Ukraine remain sceptical that Russia even wants to end the fighting. Intelligence suggests that drones could be used to inflict harm to vital infrastructure. The deal sets up an investment fund to search for minerals, and set outs how revenues would be split. The White House has been pushing for the agreement as a prerequisite for further military assistance. A minister says nearly all key details have been finalised for a deal giving the US access to the country's minerals. The announcement comes after North Korea confirmed for the first time its soldiers are fighting alongside Russia. Copyright 2025 BBC.

It also included embracing Witkoff's framework, which called for the release of half the remaining hostages over the coming weeks. Additionally, KAN News reported on Thursday that Egypt has been working intensively to convince Hamas to agree to US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff's framework for an updated hostage-ceasefire proposal.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250320002451315?sec,"SEOUL, March 20 (Yonhap) -- Prosecutors on Thursday raided Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon's office and residence over allegations of corruption surrounding his ties with self-proclaimed power broker Myung Tae-kyun. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office sent prosecutors and investigators to Oh's office at Seoul City Hall and his residence in the morning to search for possible evidence linked to the allegations. They also raided the residence of Kang Cheol-won, the city's former deputy mayor for public affairs. The prosecution has been looking into the suspicion that Kim Han-jung, a businessman known to be a supporter of Oh, asked the Future Korea Research Institute, a polling company effectively operated by Myung, to conduct 13 unpublished opinion polls during the 2021 Seoul mayoral by-election campaign and paid 33 million won (US$22,650) in polling costs on behalf of the Seoul mayor. Kim allegedly sent the money to the personal account of Kang Hye-kyung, who served as deputy head of the polling company, on five occasions between February and March 2021. The Seoul prosecution has so far summoned Kim and Oh's aides, including Kang, for questioning over the alleged connection with Myung after taking over the case about a month ago from the Changwon District Prosecutors Office in the southeastern city of Changwon, where Myung and the polling company are based. Myung has alleged that he met Oh seven times and had a three-way meeting involving Kim and he played an important role in Oh's election win at that time. Oh and Kim have both denied the allegations. Oh, who filed a complaint with the prosecution against the broker late last year, accusing him of fraud, said he met Myung twice in January 2021 but severed ties with him later. Kim has reportedly admitted to sending money to Myung's side but insisted it has nothing to do with Oh's campaign. ycm@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) Prosecutors raid Seoul mayor over corruption allegations,Yoo Cheong-mo,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-20T10:48:15,2025-03-20T10:48:15,gemini-2.0-flash

At least 12 protesters were arrested during Wednesday’s rally and at protests that continued into the night, with policing clashed with demonstrators and employing watercannons to break up the crowds. A taxi driver ran over a protester, injuring him, and was later arrested after fleeing the scene. The major protests came as the government seeks to oust Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, two officials who have drawn the ire of Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition in recent months. Outrage over preparations to sack the two, coupled with the resumption of fighting in Gaza that has left the fate of remaining hostages uncertain, prompted greater impetus and support for the anti-government protests. In the morning, police blocked the main highway leading into the capital to traffic as protesters waving Israeli flags and yellow banners set out from Motza, on Jerusalem’s western outskirts. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories “It’s time to end this madness before we don’t have anyone to save, before we don’t have a country left,” protest leader Shikma Bressler told the crowd before entering the city. The protesters gathered outside the Knesset around noon, then proceeded to Netanyahu’s home, on Azza Street in Jerusalem’s Rehavia neighborhood. Activists leading the march held a large banner that read: “Enough of the government of destruction,” as the large crowds proceeded down Ben Zvi Boulevard, which police also closed to traffic. Hundreds of others further up the road sat on the pavement while chanting for a deal to free the remaining hostages in Gaza, and in support of the top officials the government plans to oust. “It happened to Ron Arad, it could happen to all of us,” they chanted, referring to the Israeli Air Force officer long presumed dead following his 1986 capture in Lebanon and subsequent disappearance. Many protesters held signs with slogans calling for an end to the war, while a handful carried signs calling on reservists to refuse to serve in the military, as an act of defiance against Netanyahu’s government. During a speech outside Netanyahu’s private home, protest leader Moshe Radman seemed to compare the government to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and other bitter enemies of the Jewish people. “We got through Haman, we got through Pharaoh, we got through the British Mandate, we got through Hitler… we’ll get through them too,” he said through a megaphone to the applause of other demonstrators. According to the Ynet news site, Radman later attempted to soften his remarks, saying: “We don’t want a strand of hair to fall from Netanyahu’s head, we only wish for him to get booted from the government and sit in jail until his very last day.” At the top of the street, near Netanyahu’s official residence, a group of silent protesters sat in the middle of Paris Square, blocking the intersection	 to traffic. Jerusalem police said in the afternoon that they had arrested four people, including one armed counter-protester who threatened to harm demonstrators. “Over the course of the protest, dozens of participants began to disrupt the public order,” a law enforcement spokesman said, adding that many attempted to break through crowd control barriers. Some protesters also used their cars to block main streets in the capital without police authorization, in what the spokesman called “a blatant violation of the protest conditions agreed upon in advance between protesters and Israel Police in recent days.” He noted that police were planning to tow the vehicles. The protests continued into the late evening, with demonstrators lighting bonfires on Azza Street and clashing with police. Footage from the street showed The Democrats MK Gilad Kariv being forcibly shoved away by cops, which the left-wing opposition party decried as “crossing a red line.”
               “This is what a dictatorship looks like,” it said in a tweet. “This isn’t law enforcement. This is trampling of democracy. We won’t shut up and won’t give in.” After nightfall, a taxi driver rammed into a protester in what looked to be an intentional attack. The incident left the protester, Oded Rotem, momentarily unconscious with a minor injury to his leg. According to eyewitnesses, the car dragged Rotem for 50 meters (160 feet) on Herzog Street. Rotem was hospitalized. The driver fled the scene and was later apprehended by police. The Democrats party chairman Yair Golan accused Netanyahu’s government of inciting violence, calling the incident “a terrorist attack,” in a post on X, assering	that the “violence against patriotic protesters is a direct result of the hatred, lies, and incitement emanating directly from the Israeli government.” Anti-government protesters gather around a bonfire on Azza Street in Jerusalem, near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence, on March 19, 2025. (Gilad Furst Protest Movement) Earlier in the day, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid called on people to go out and demonstrate, calling Netanyahu’s government “illegitimate.” “We are taking to the streets because the Israeli government has lost its legitimacy,” Lapid declared in a recorded message. “We will not break the law, we will continue to serve, but we will stand firm against a government that is trying to dismantle the country.” Gantz clashes with demonstrator Outside the Knesset, one angry demonstrator got into a heated confrontation with National Unity chairman Benny Gantz, who had gone out to greet the protesters in a show of support. “Get out of here, you disgrace, you betrayed us!” he shouted at the politician, apparently accusing Gantz of not doing enought to fight the government. That prompted a heated shouting match during which the two were physically separated by security, as Gantz shouted back: “For 40 years I fought for the country, and you call me a betrayer?” Following the incident, Gantz tweeted that most protesters are “Israeli patriots who care about the country,” but that “an unrepresentative handful of arsonists who hate Netanyahu more than they love the country.” Gantz’s use of the term “arsonists” garnered criticism from politicians to his left, including Democrats party chairman Yair Golan, who countered that “the protesters who took to the streets today are the greatest lovers of Israel I have ever met.” In a statement hitting back at Golan, National Unity accused the opposition politician of “distorting Gantz’s words, who emphasized the importance of the demonstration and the fact that most of the demonstrators were Israeli patriots.”","Major protests in Jerusalem as Netanyahu seeks to fire Shin Bet chief, renews Gaza war",Charlie Summers,The Times of Israel,2025-03-19T15:10:19,2025-03-19T18:26:20,gemini-2.0-flash

https://katu.com/news/local/state-emergency-declared-as-storms-cause-fatal-flooding-landslides-in-southern-oregon,"PORTLAND, Ore. (KATU) — Gov. Tina Kotek has declared a state of emergency over to deadly flooding and landslides in Southern Oregon. The declaration was made due to the damage caused by ongoing storms that have impacted the state since Feb. 24. Those storms have led to significant flooding and landslides across the state and resulted in at least one fatality, according to state officials. READ MORE: Storm brings flooding, landslides to SW Oregon; one person drowns in floodwaters The emergency declaration allows responders to use all necessary and appropriate resources in disaster response. The Oregon Department of Transportation is out doing repairs on roadways, clearing debris, and shoring up hillsides to prevent further landslides. ""Early estimates for repairs for damaged two roads are about $10 million,"" said ODOT spokesperson Julie Denny. ""It is an early estimate and we expect after assessing more that that will change."" Denny said ODOT crews still have quite a lot of work to do, and they will seek federal reimbursement for damages that occurred during the emergency. “When emergencies hit, Oregon families and businesses need to know we have their back in every part of the state,” Kotek said in a press release. The declaration includes Clackamas, Coos, Curry, Douglas, Harney, Jackson, Josephine, Lane, Multnomah, and Malheur counties. ""It got to the point where we couldn't get our car or truck out it was too deep,"" said Ron Heaton of Sutherlin. “Recovery starts as soon as disaster strikes, and this declaration will help get Oregonians back to normal as soon as possible. I urge everyone to follow the instructions and evacuation levels issued by emergency officials, subscribe emergency alerts on ORAlert.gov, have an evacuation plan, prepare a go-kit, and stay aware of changing conditions,” she added. The Oregon Department of Emergency Management activated the State Emergency Coordination Center to Level 3 on March 17. That means the state is coordinating closely with local, Tribal, and state partners to share information and support local response and recovery operations as needed, officials said. Tap here to learn more about current conditions and impacts from the storms. There's another system moving in to the region, and some areas that haven't recovered might see more damage. ODOT said it is also hard to say how long roads will be impacted in Southern Oregon.","State emergency declared as storms cause fatal flooding, landslides in Southern Oregon",KATU Staff,KATU,2025-03-19T10:09:21,2025-03-20T13:47:23,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c204290er1ro,"Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa has told the BBC he wants US, European and Brazilian armies to join his ""war"" against criminal gangs. He added he wants US President Donald Trump to designate Ecuadorean gangs as terrorist groups, as he has done for some Mexican and Venezuelan cartels. He also said Ecuadorean law would be respected when asked about his recent partnership with Erik Prince, an ally of Trump and founder of controversial private military firm Blackwater. Violence has soared in Ecuador in recent years, with gangs battling to control drug trafficking routes. Most of the world's cocaine is trafficked through Ecuador's ports. President Noboa has previously indicated he would like foreign military aid to help tackle drug cartels – but this is the first time he has singled out the US, Brazil and Europe. Security – and how he is dealing with it – is a top issue for voters ahead of a run-off vote in Ecuador's presidential election on 13 April. Noboa has defined his 16 months in office through a tough crackdown on gangs and militarising the streets and prisons – however he has also come under fire from critics who see his tactics as too heavy-handed. During his term, the murder rate decreased by approximately 16% from 2023 to 2024 but it remains far higher than previous years, and in January 2025 killings hit a record 781 in one month. In an interview with BBC News, the incumbent president said: ""We need to have more soldiers to fight this war."" ""Seventy per cent of the world's cocaine exits via Ecuador. We need the help of international forces."" He said what started as ""criminal gangs"" are now ""international narco-terrorist"" groups of 14,000 armed individuals. Donald Trump's decision to designate some Latin American cartels as terrorist groups has given US law enforcement further powers to fight them. Noboa told the BBC he wants his US counterpart to do the same with Ecuadorean gangs: ""I would be glad if he considers Los Lobos, Los Choneros, Los Tiguerones as terrorist groups because that's what they really are."" Noboa has already ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with ""allied nations"" to support Ecuador's police and army, and is also seeking parliamentary approval to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in Ecuador again. As well as constitutional changes, it would require other nations to be willing to offer this. Deploying armies abroad can be risky and expensive but there is some precedent for it. The US had a military base for its anti-narcotic operations in Ecuador until 2009, before these were banned by former President Rafael Correa. President Noboa's challenge will be convincing figures like Donald Trump in the US, or leaders in Europe where many drugs are shipped to, that it is in their interests too to stop cartels and drug trafficking. On the alliance with Trump ally Erik Prince, which he announced a few days ago, he said: ""We're fighting an unconventional, urban guerilla war. He has the experience. He's advising our armed forces, our police."" Mr Prince founded the private military firm Blackwater that has provided security services to US governments but has also been embroiled in controversy. He sold the company in 2010. Four Blackwater contractors were convicted and jailed for killing 14 Iraqi citizens in Baghdad's Nisour Square in 2007 and were later pardoned by Trump in 2020. Does President Noboa want Mr Prince to bring mercenaries to the country? ""Not necessarily mercenaries,"" he said. ""We are talking about armies. US, European, Brazilian special forces. This could be a great help for us."" While some supported the move, some Ecuadoreans cited Mr Prince's past record and feared rights abuses in the country. When asked about some of Erik Prince's past controversies, Mr Noboa said Ecuador's laws must be respected and warfare conducted legally. But, he added, cartels had ""violated every single human right possible for the last five years"". ""They've mutilated people. They've raped thousands of women. They've trafficked human organs. They've traded illegal gold. And moved more than 1,000 tonnes of cocaine a year."" Last year, his iron-fist approach came under fire after four boys were arrested by soldiers over an alleged theft and later found mutilated and burned. Noboa said those soldiers were in jail pending an investigation but that he would ""fight until the end"" to convict those responsible. He maintained the armed forces were acting proportionately in tackling crime and noted an imbalance between his 35,000-strong military and 40,000 armed gang members. With the record number of killings in January, leading critics argue his strict approach is failing. During a campaign rally, his left-wing challenger Luisa González said: ""The campaign promises made in 2023 were to be delivered in a year and a half. Not two. Not three. Did he deliver? No!"" Noboa said it was normal to see rising violence before elections in his country, but reiterated that Ecuador could not fight this problem alone: ""This is a transnational crime without a transnational security policy."" While Albanian, Mexican and Colombian cartels worked together, there was not a joint security policy among countries affected by drug violence, he said. Ecuador needs help, he argued, because its economy is smaller than many in Europe or the US where most drugs are shipped to. He added drug trafficking and illegal mining generated $30bn (£23bn) – around 27% of GDP – annually in Ecuador. He urged countries where consumption of cocaine is high, like the UK, to do more to tackle this arguing: ""The product they're consuming has a chain of violence and misery."" Violence and post-pandemic unemployment have driven many Ecuadoreans to flee northward. They are now one of the top nationalities crossing the dangerous Darien Gap jungle from South to North America. President Noboa is willing to take back Ecuadorean migrants from the US, but not other nationalities, and said the country was giving returnees technical training and a minimum wage for three months. For him, the solution is improving ""opportunities"". ""We need to develop, as an export-based economy, jobs in Ecuador for these people."" While he said he ""100%"" empathised with people fleeing violence, he blamed a past ""lack of strong security policy"". His message to Ecuadoreans now? ""Stay - and you'll see positive results. We're reducing inflation. Companies are hiring. The economy is recovering."" Daniel Noboa will face Luisa González in the run-off vote next month. He received only 0.5% more votes than her in the first round, suggesting the second round could be very close and polarising. With security the top issue for voters, his success – or not – may depend on whether Ecuadoreans think progress has been good enough.","US and European armies should join our war on gangs, Ecuador president tells BBC",Ione Wells,BBC News,2025-03-18T21:05:59,2025-03-18T21:05:59,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-19-2025-88abc5eb7cd137adb01bbd8a86ca6503,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel said Wednesday its troops retook part of a corridor that bisects Gaza, and its defense minister warned that attacks would intensify until Hamas frees dozens of hostages and gives up control of the territory. The military said it had retaken part of the Netzarim Corridor that divides northern Gaza from the south, and from where it had previously withdrawn as part of a ceasefire that began in January. That truce was shattered Tuesday by Israeli airstrikes that killed more than 400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The advances on the ground by Israel on Wednesday — which included sending more troops to southern Gaza — threatened to drag the sides into all-out war again. The ceasefire had given war-weary Palestinians some respite, allowed a much-needed surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza — and led to the release of dozens of hostages who had been held for more than 15 months. Early Thursday, a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace, the military said. Air raid sirens and several explosions were heard in Jerusalem, apparently the sounds of the interceptors in use. No injuries were reported. Yemen’s Houthi rebels did not immediately claim the attack Thursday morning. Within Israel, the resumption of airstrikes and ground maneuvers in Gaza has raised concerns about the fate of roughly two dozen hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive. Thousands of Israelis took part in anti-government demonstrations in Jerusalem, with many calling for a deal to bring the captives home. A Hamas spokesman, Abdel-Latif al-Qanou, said the moves by ground forces in Gaza was a clear sign that Israel had backed out of the truce and was reimposing a “blockade.” There have been no reports of rocket attacks by Hamas since Tuesday’s bombardment. Also Wednesday, the United Nations said one of its employees was killed in Gaza and five others were wounded in an apparent strike on a guesthouse. It was not immediately clear who was behind the strike, the U.N. said. The military said its “limited ground operation” in Gaza would create a “partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza.” It wasn’t immediately clear whether the move would entirely block Palestinians from traveling north or south through the Netzarim Corridor. Israel used the roughly 4-mile (6-kilometer) corridor as a military zone during the war. It ran from the Israeli border to the coast, just south of Gaza City, the territory’s largest metropolitan area. Israel said airstrikes on Wednesday hit dozens of militants and militant sites, including the command center of a Hamas battalion. It denied Palestinian claims that it hit the U.N. guesthouse. Fares Awad, an official in the Gaza Health Ministry, said an Israeli strike on a gathering of mourners in the northern town of Beit Lahiya killed 17 and wounded 30. The Israeli military had no immediate comment.  Until Israel withdrew from Netzarim in January, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who had fled northern Gaza for the south were prevented from returning throughout the war. Many of them have since returned. But Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, said the military would soon order Palestinians to evacuate from combat zones. Katz said Tuesday’s aerial bombardment “was just the first step” in Israel’s plan to ratchet up the pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and give up control of Gaza. Until it does, Israel will attack “with an intensity that you have not known.”  Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the U.N. Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike in the central city of Deir al-Balah. He said the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity.  He did not provide the nationalities of those killed and wounded.  Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike. “Israel knew this was a U.N. premise, that people were living, staying and working there,” he said. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said the explosion was not caused by Israeli fire. After the strike Wednesday, the wounded were rushed to Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital in central city of Deir al-Balah. One man was carried inside on a blanket held up by medical workers. Another lay on a hospital bed, his knee bandaged.  In southern Lebanon, a U.N. peacekeeper was wounded after stepping on a mine. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said the incident took place during “operational activity” by the peacekeeping mission known as UNIFIL in the village of Zibqin, adding that the injuries are not life-threatening. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched the strikes early Tuesday. It said another 678 people have been wounded. The military says it only strikes militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.  The war has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. The Health Ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children. The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals; 59 hostages remain, and more than half are believed to be dead. Before this week’s attacks, Israel and Hamas were set to negotiate an extension of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, which lasted six weeks.  But those talk never got off the ground. Hamas has demanded that Israel stick to the terms of the initial ceasefire deal, including a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. Israel, which has vowed to defeat Hamas, has put forward a new proposal that would extend the truce and free more hostages held by Hamas, without a commitment to end the war. The breakdown of the ceasefire was met with anger in Israel, where many support the plight of the hostage families to free their loved ones. Israel’s return to a military campaign came as Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests taking place over his handling of the hostage crisis and his plan to fire the head of Israel’s internal security agency. Demonstrators massed around Israel’s parliament on Wednesday and later marched near Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem, where police sprayed water to try to clear them. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem and Magdy from Cairo. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at ",Israeli troops advance in Gaza to retake part of a corridor dividing north from south,"Wafaa Shurafa, Julia Frankel, Samy Magdy",AP News,2025-03-19T13:28:18,2025-03-19T22:27:16,gemini-2.0-flash

The Bangladesh transitional government expressed distress about remarks by the US intelligence chief that the religious minorities situation in Bangladesh is concerning.
Tulsi Gabbard has managed to “paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush,” the media wing of transitional government head Muhammad Yunus said in a statement late Monday.
That was after Gabbard told Indian broadcaster NDTV World that the “persecution and killing” of religious minorities in Bangladesh and “the threat of Islamic terrorists” is “rooted” in the “ideology and objective” to “rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate.""
Bangladesh said Gabbard's comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations.
Calling it misleading and damaging to the image of the country, the statement said Bangladesh has a traditional practice of Islam. It said the country has been famously inclusive and peaceful, and has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism.
Groundlessly linking Bangladesh to the idea of an ""Islamist caliphate” undermines the hard work of countless Bangladeshis and their friends and partners around the world who are committed to peace, stability, and progress, it said.
The statement encouraged political leaders and public figures to base their comments, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes to fan fears and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions.
The comments came at a moment when Bangladesh and India have been witnessing a bitter exchange of words and border tension since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, known for her friendly relations with India, fled to India last Aug. 5 in a popular uprising.
Since the changeover, India continued to allege that minorities, particularly Hindus, are the victims of violence due to the changes in Bangladesh.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi complained to US President Trump in a recent visit to the US, that minorities in Bangladesh were being targeted.
The Yunus government, however, ruled out India’s complaints as fabricated and hate campaigns against Bangladesh.
Bangladesh finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed, talking to reporters Tuesday said that Gabbard's remarks will not affect bilateral or multilateral relations between Bangladesh and the US, and will have no effect on Bangladesh’s economy.",Dhaka slams US spy chief’s 'misleading' comments about Bangladesh,Sm Najmus Sakib,Anadolu Agency,2025-03-18T00:00:00,2025-03-18T00:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250319000900320,"SEOUL, March 19 (Yonhap) -- South Korea will take measures to prevent the circumvention of antidumping duties on imported steel products as part of efforts to protect the local steel industry amid heightened global trade barriers, the industry ministry said Wednesday. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced the plan at a meeting of economy-related ministers, presided over by acting President Choi Sang-mok, according to ministry officials. The plan comes after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on all steel imports last week, a move expected to deal a blow to the South Korean steel industry. To prevent trade circumvention, the government plans to revise its customs regulation to allow the Korea Trade Commission (KTC) to investigate circumvention of antidumping duties by rerouting products through a third country. The government will also require a mill test certificate, which contains detailed information on the product's country of origin, for all steel imports. Additionally, a special team will be created under the Korea Customs Service to crack down on the practice of disguising imported goods as domestically produced products for domestic distribution or exports. The ministry said it will also work to exempt duties on Korean steel products by closely communicating with the governments of major economies, including the U.S., through various trade channels. The government will also respond to the planned imposition of carbon levies by the European Union (EU) under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the EU's push to strengthen its trade safeguard measures, as well as India's safeguard investigation of steel imports, the ministry added. The ministry plans to devise a strategy to bolster the competitiveness of the local steel industry later this year to overcome the crisis sparked by the global trade war. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)",S.

The next session, which is to run from April 5 to 18, would use the Joint Theater Level Simulation systems to help commanders across all levels to test the validity of their plans and strategies, and how to work better with their own staff, it said. The final results of the second stage are to be implemented in the live exercises from July 7 to 18, with all commanding officers encouraged to develop strategies that consider possible actions from enemy forces, it said. The exercises, at different stages, expect to set the rules of engagement, implement decentralization of command, review weapon and equipment efficacy in combat situations, general logistics support, and how well the military and civilian sectors are integrated, it said. The exercises hope to address strategies involving joint task force efforts to lock down enemy forces, implement defensive mine-laying, spread out munition supplies and logistics, test the efficacy of newly acquired weapons, and gauge how well civilian and military arms integrate with each other, the report said.

It also aims to restrict countries from closing themselves off to waste metal imports, according to the paper. The Commission is set to present its final action plan on steel and metalsÂ
present on Wednesday, providing guidelines on how to make European metal production more sustainable and competitive amid trade tensions with the USÂ
and fierce global competition. The text makes clear that the EU executive is expecting overcapacity to worsen the trade situation in the steel markets after existing safeguard measures expire on 30 June 2026.Â
""Instead, the problem may worsen as more countries restrict imports, making the EU a key destination for surplus steel,"" according to the draft. For this reason â

by the third quarter of 2025 at the latest, the Commission will propose a long-term measure providing an equivalent level of protection to the EUâ

s steel sector,â

the document reads. â

â

The timing of the proposal will ensure that the new measure will be in force in time to replace the current safeguard and provide the same degree of defence against negative trade-related effects caused by global overcapacities and to base this approach on a combination of tariff quotas, taking account of security and resilience considerations, as well as of changes in EU demand, while maintaining a certain level of openness of the EU market,â

the document adds. The European Commission will also launch an investigation for possible safeguard measures for the aluminium sector, since the combination of a loss of substantial market share of EU producers and the recent US tariff on aluminium are â

likely to worsen the situation further with a significant threat of trade diversion from multiple destinationsâ

, the paper says. The document also specified that existing export restrictions imposed by third countries on exports of waste metals should be countered with reciprocal measures.

https://apnews.com/article/canada-carney-arctic-circle-greenland-d44e557453bc402a8c4e617041e262b0,"IQALUIT, Nunavut (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday announced a radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada’s far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region. The prime minister’s office said the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) Over-the-Horizon Radar system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic. Carney announced the purchase at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut on his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there. “Arctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,” Carney said. ““Canada is, and forever will be, an Arctic nation.” The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up. “This will be a significant export if this deal is finalized,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.   Albanese had a phone call with Carney the prior night.  “Obviously, there are issues taking place, particularly between Canada and the United States, I wouldn’t have expected to have been happening in my lifetime,” Albanese said.   Senior Canadian government officials, who briefed reporters on Carney’s plane before the announcement, said the purchase has been well received by top military officials in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian military command that overseas threats over the two countries.   But the officials said they couldn’t say how the Australian purchase would be received politically by Washington. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.  Carney also announced the government will spend Canadian $420 million ($294 million) to expand Canada’s Arctic operations and training exercises and deploy more personnel. He said Canada will have a “greater sustained year-round presence.” The prime minister’s flight path took him over Greenland. U.S. President Donald Trump’s interest in Greenland, northeast of Nunavut, comes as part of an aggressively “America First” foreign policy platform that has included threats to take control of the Panama Canal and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. “The United States priorities, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,” Carney said.  Trump has threatened economic coercion to make Canada the 51st state. His constant talk of annexation has infuriated Canadians and turned around the political fortunes of the governing Liberal party, which was headed for a historic defeat but now has a chance of winning a fourth term. Carney is expected to call a general election by the end of the week.  The president is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products and has already placed them on steel and aluminum.   Carney and Trump have not spoken since Carney was elected as the new Liberal party leader and prime minister more than a week ago. Carney said at the “appropriate time” he will have a discussion with the U.S. president, as “two sovereign nations, that is comprehensive and not targeted at one issue.” But Trump keeps disrespecting Canada, saying twice on Fox News on Tuesday night that that “Canada was meant to be the 51st state.” He said that’s why he’s he’s tougher on his neighbor than America’s biggest adversaries. Trump also repeated several times that he didn’t care that the Liberals might win the Canadian election now.  “The Conservative that’s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don’t know, but he said negative things,” Trump said. “So, when he says negative things, I couldn’t care less. I think it’s easier to deal actually with a Liberal. And maybe they’re going to win, but I don’t really care. It doesn’t matter to me at all.” Carney visited Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.  For much of the year, the weather in Iqaluit can be severe. In February 2010, Iqaluit hosted a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations. Several of the dignitaries, including Carney when he was head of Canada’s central bank, went dogsledding in subfreezing temperatures. It is a distinctive destination — home to about 7,500 people but not a single traffic light — with no road or rail links to the outside world. Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put the Arctic at the heart of the debate over global trade and security.",Canada's new leader announces $4.2 billion Australian radar purchase,Rob Gillies,AP News,2025-03-18T15:27:04,2025-03-18T22:49:33,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/peru-state-of-emergency-violence-singer-death-f2a2addd25f983dec817fda0a25062cf,"LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru’s president declared a state of emergency in the capital Monday and ordered the deployment of soldiers to help police address a surge of violence, amid widespread outcry a day after the killing of a popular singer. President Dina Boluarte’s government published a decree saying that the state of emergency will last 30 days, and authorities will restrict some rights, including the freedom of assembly and movement. That means the police and the army would be able to detain people without a judicial order. Peru has seen an increase of killings, violent extortion and attacks on public places in recent months. Police reported 459 killings from Jan. 1 to March 16, and 1,909 extortion reports in January alone. But outrage crested after the killing Sunday of Paul Flores, the 39-year-old lead singer of the cumbia band Armonia 10. In Congress, opposition lawmakers requested a vote of no confidence against Interior Minister Juan José Santiváñez for what they say is a lack of a plan to fight rising violence. The vote is expected to be discussed in the Congress’ plenary later this week. Flores was shot to death early Sunday when assailants attacked the bus he and bandmates were traveling after a concert in Lima. Cumbia is a Latin music style that people dance to the rhythm of drums, maracas and other instruments. The attack against the popular singer was not the only violent event over the weekend. On Saturday, an object exploded at a restaurant in the capital, injuring at least 11 people. Boluarte’s government previously decreed a state of emergency in an attempt to stem the violence between September and December.",Peru declares emergency and deploys army,,AP News,2025-03-18T00:11:07,2025-03-18T16:34:29,gemini-2.0-flash

Ahn plans to hold a face-to-face meeting with Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, scheduled to visit Seoul for two days from Monday, according to the sources familiar with the matter. In the planned meeting, the two sides are expected to discuss Seoul's potential investment in the Donald Trump administration's Alaska liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, aimed at building a nearly 1,200-kilometer gas pipeline from Alaska's vast North Slope to its southern port in Nikiski. Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun (L) speaks at a meeting with local steel industry officials in Seoul on March 13, 2025. (Yonhap) South Korea has been considering taking part in the project as part of apparent efforts to negotiate on new U.S. tariffs. Earlier this month, Trump openly welcomed Seoul's potential participation in the project, along with Tokyo. Japan and South Korea are respectively the world's second- and third-largest LNG importers. Seoul's offer to join the Alaska project came as it is considered a prominent bargaining chip for South Korea, which has been facing mounting pressure to sharply reduce its trade surplus with the United States in order to avoid the U.S.' new ""reciprocal"" tariffs. Industry watchers say the project could open new opportunities for the South Korean steel, shipbuilding and construction industries as the gas pipeline construction requires advanced technologies, in which Korean companies enjoy a competitive edge. But since the project could be a burden on Korean companies, the government has said it will closely assess the economic feasibility and the risks of the project before making a decision. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)",Industry minister to meet Alaska governor next week to discuss gas pipeline project: sources,Kim Na-young,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-18T08:57:40,2025-03-18T08:57:40,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/pm-idf-launching-strikes-throughout-gaza-after-hamas-refused-repeated-hostage-deal-offers/,"The IDF is launching strikes throughout Gaza after receiving orders from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz to “act forcefully” against Hamas amid the terror group’s refusal to release Israeli hostages, the premier’s office says. The IDF attacks appear to mark a return to the Israeli military campaign against Hamas that was halted with the start of a ceasefire on January 19, though the statement from the Prime Minister’s Office does not explicitly say this. “At the direction of the political echelon, the IDF and Shin Bet are extensively attacking Hamas terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip,” the IDF and Shin Bet say in a subsequent joint statement, adding that additional details will be provided shortly. Netanyahu’s office says Hamas “rejected all offers it received” from US special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff and the other mediators. Hamas has insisted on sticking with the original terms of the deal, which was supposed to enter its second phase at the beginning of the month. That phase envisioned Israel fully withdrawing from Gaza and agreeing to permanently end the war in exchange for the release of the remaining living hostages. While Israel signed on to the deal, Netanyahu has long insisted that Israel will not end the war until Hamas’s governing and military capabilities have been destroyed. Accordingly, Israel refused to even hold talks regarding the terms of phase two, which were supposed to begin on February 3. Nonetheless, the ceasefire had been remaining in place for roughly two and a half weeks after the conclusion of the first phase, as mediators worked to broker new terms for the truce’s extension. Accepting Israel’s aversion to phase two, Witkoff presented a bridge proposal last week that would have seen phase one extended for several weeks during which five living hostages would be released. The US envoy said Sunday that Hamas’s response to the offer was a “non-starter” and warned of impending consequences if the terror group did not change its approach. In its statement announcing the overnight strike, Netanyahu’s office says they are aimed at achieving Israel’s war aims, which are the dismantlement of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities and the return of the hostages. Hostage families have long argued that those aims contradict each other and that a return to fighting will endanger their loved ones. “From now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military force,” Netanyahu’s office says, adding that the plans for the resumption of IDF operations were approved last week by the political echelon.",PM: IDF launching strikes throughout Gaza after Hamas refused repeated hostage deal offers,Jacob Magid,The Times of Israel,2025-03-18T00:40:28,2025-03-18T00:23:51,gemini-2.0-flash
https://buenosairesherald.com/business/industry/industricide-argentine-companies-warn-of-tariff-cuts-taxes-and-exchange-rate,"Despite the economic rebound projected for this year, job creation expectations in Argentina’s industrial sector remain bleak. According to data from the INDEC statistics bureau, one in four companies plans to reduce its workforce within the next sixty days. The government is deepening the exchange rate lag while accelerating trade liberalization. Meanwhile, companies — alert to high taxes — warn that an “explosive mix” is forming for national production. The industry barely has time to process one piece of bad news before the next arrives. After the heavy blow of the recession in the first half of 2024, a sharp process of deregulation and trade liberalization followed. Then, the exchange rate began to appreciate, and tariff reductions were introduced. Everything is moving in the same direction — more difficulties producing in Argentina. “A fixed exchange rate, no tax cuts, and tariff reductions — it’s a collective execution,” stated the owner of an industrial company with multiple factories in the country that employs over 600 people. The combination described by the entrepreneur, who requested anonymity, is becoming even more pronounced. Inflation accelerated again in February, jumping to 2.4%, just as the government decided to slow the pace of official exchange rate devaluation. Over the weekend, Economy Minister Luis Caputo announced another round of tariff cuts. The industrial sector criticizes the order of events, arguing that import taxes are being cut first, making for an uneven playing field. Tariff Reductions “In the coming days, we will publish a decree in the Official Gazette to lower tariffs on clothing and footwear from 35% to 20%, on fabrics from 26% to 18%, and on various yarns from 18% to 12%, 14%, and 16%,” Caputo announced on his X account. The Argentine Chamber of the Apparel Industry and the Argentine Apparel Federation responded with a strongly-worded statement: “The tariff reductions announced by the national government will destroy thousands of jobs and domestic companies.” They continued: “The government must first fulfill its promises to lower taxes, reduce payroll costs, stop abusive lawsuits, cut high financial costs, and lift currency controls.”  “Without doing that first, this measure is industrial suicide,” they concluded. Next Monday, the Textile Chamber of Mar del Plata will hold a press conference, warning that the measure will have a severe impact on the city. The textile value chain employs 520,000 people nationwide. Employment Employment is emerging as one of the most sensitive variables in the coming months. According to an INDEC survey, 27% of industrial companies plan to cut jobs in the next 60 days. Only 7% expect to hire new employees, while 60% plan to keep their workforce unchanged. Sources from the Argentine Association of Metalworking Industrialists explained that in February, the sector experienced a 1.8% year-on-year decline and a slight 0.3% contraction compared with January. “While some sectors show signs of recovery, the overall trend continues to indicate difficulties in job creation,” they stated. Expectations in this regard are also not optimistic: 72% of companies plan to maintain or reduce their workforce, while only 28% anticipate a slight increase in employment. “This suggests that the sector’s recovery still faces significant challenges,” the association reported. Small businesses and the government’s theory The situation worsens when focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises. Mauro González, president of the Federal SME Confederation, provided some figures: “Nearly 15,000 companies closed in the past year, and about 100,000 jobs were lost nationwide.” Looking ahead, he agreed that employment prospects are negative. “It has already become clear that Argentina’s production of goods and services has shrunk, and this will directly impact employment,” he said. Despite the global debate on the relocation of production cycles, the government downplays the destruction of industrial jobs, arguing that jobs lost in one sector will be created in another. However, this premise has yet to be confirmed in practice: according to official data, more than 119,000 registered private-sector jobs have been lost so far.

“Raising sails and sailing the impetuous waves, the ancestors of the Chinese nation opened the Maritime Silk Road between the East and the West more than 2,000 years ago,” Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his speech in Lima.

It was around 7 p.m. on November 14, 2024. Sitting next to his Peruvian counterpart, Dina Boluarte, Xi added that, more than 500 years ago, the Incas had “managed to build the great road that crossed the Andes Mountains from North to South.”

In Chancay, some 80 kilometers from the Peruvian capital, dozens of Chinese and Peruvian officials followed his words via videoconference as they lined up in front of giant blue containers bearing the Cosco Shipping brand.

“Today, the port of Chancay becomes the starting point of the great Inca road of a new era, from Chancay to Shanghai,” Xi said. With those words, he inaugurated the Chancay Multipurpose Port Terminal.

Experts say the port is expected to become a regional hub that will consolidate trade between Asia and South America.

According to economist Jorge Vega, professor at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica del PerÃº (PUCP), this is due to the port’s “location, size, modern technology, and contact with global shipping networks.” The travel time between South America and China will fall from 36 days to 24 days.

A brief history

It was 2007 when former Peruvian Navy commander Juan Ribaudo de la Torre suggested that the Chancay Bay, with its depth of almost 18 meters, was perfectly suited for building a port capable of receiving large commercial vessels. He created the Chancay Ports Company, and, in 2011, the project attracted the attention of the mining company Volcan, which acquired 50% of the shares.

After Ribaudo’s death in 2013, the mining company took over 100% of the project and began work in 2016. However, development of the project required an investment that exceeded their means, and they sought a partner.

In 2019, Cosco Shipping Ports joined the project, acquiring 60% of the shares. The Chinese state-owned company is part of the Ocean Alliance, a strategic commercial alliance within the Belt and Road initiative — China’s strategy to bolster its trade routes.

Construction of the port began in 2020, which foresees a total investment of US$3.4 billion. Last November, the first stage was inaugurated. Featuring four docks, an administrative complex, logistical services, and a tunnel almost two kilometers long, the initial stage cost US$1.32 billion.

According to Cosco, the group envisions the construction of a total of 15 docks in four stages, which will be operational by 2032. The megaport will also be an automated facility, with autonomous cranes, unmanned electric vehicles, and, according to the company, all of it will be carbon-free.

According to the Peruvian Central Reserve Bank, the port’s contribution to the economy will be 0.3% of GDP in this first phase, and that figure is expected to reach 0.9% by 2025.

Regional impact

For internationalist Óscar Vidarte, “the port of Chancay will completely change the shipping dynamics of the South Pacific,” although he noted that “there is a lot of fear, especially in Chile, because the construction will affect local ports.”

“Ships from Chile and Peru normally travel as far as Mexico or the United States before their contents are loaded onto larger vessels in order to cross the Pacific,” he said.

“Trade of Chilean exports to China will speed up,” the PUCP professor explained. “This is fundamental for fruits and all edible products.”

Vidarte likewise added that Chancay could improve the connection routes between Peru and Brazil, but that it will depend on whether the South American giant is interested in crossing the Amazon to reach the Peruvian coast or prefers instead to keep its shipping route in the Atlantic.

In May 2024, Brazil and China inaugurated a new trade route linking Carioca ports with the city of Tianjin, 170 kilometers from Beijing. The shipping company managing this route will be Cosco Shipping as well.

“Is there an economic justification for spending so much money on a railroad linking Peru and Brazil, with the port of Chancay as a departure point? I believe that now, because before there was no port,” said Vidarte.

However, specialists warn that before such a construction can be considered, Peru must first solve its infrastructure problems. For Vega, the government “is behind in providing adequate roads or railways,” as well as in the urban improvement and expansion of Chancay.

The PUCP professor also indicated that public and private projects are being developed for expansion and new roads on the Pan-American Highway, which connects Chancay with the rest of the country. “But all this will take time to materialize and will not be ready before May,” which is when the trial period will end and full operations will begin.

The United States weighs in

In an interview with Bloomberg four days after the inauguration, Mauricio Claver-Carone stated that any product going through Chancay, or any other Chinese-owned or controlled port in the region, should be “subject to a 60% tariff.”

“As if the product were from China,” added Cardona, who at the time was advisor to Donald Trump’s transition team. In January, he was chosen as the State Department’s new special envoy for Latin America.

Also in November, General Laura J. Richardson, former head of the U.S. Defense Department’s Southern Command, told the Financial Times that the port could host Chinese naval warships in the future, potentially turning it into a strategic point for Beijing’s plans of military expansion.

Is the Chinese presence in Chancay a threat to the United States?

For Vidarte, its crucial that we look at the full picture because there is “a lot of exaggeration.” “Claver-Carone talks about taxes, but the goods from Chancay are not meant for the United States because the port’s goal is to connect with the Asia-Pacific [region],” he said.

However, he acknowledged that the U.S. is concerned not only by Chinese economic influence. He pointed to the fact that Washington considers that the port of Chancay can be a “geostrategic port” in a scenario of “greater confrontation with China.”

“The port has been built for commercial purposes. There are neither norms nor legal considerations that say it will be used for other purposes. But [the U.S.] fears that, when the time comes, it will be used for that.”

The international relations scholar admits that, because of this situation, the Peruvian government is playing a “balancing” role. This was particularly on display during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) last November.

“On the one hand, Chancay was inaugurated while, on the other, an agreement was signed granting the United States a space port in Talara,” he recalled. The initiative is part of an agreement with NASA aimed at “boosting research and development of advanced technologies.”

The two countries will invest close to US$268 million in the project set to be located in a city just four degrees below the Equator. According to Peruvian Air Force commander Carlos Chávez, this offers an “enormous advantage” to space and suborbital vehicles.

Vidarte considers that the agreement is “no small thing” because, for the United States, space is not only a matter of research but also of “security.”

“Peru always has to find a balance in order to not be seen as either too Chinese or too American. A middle ground is quite difficult, but it’s a fine line that is still possible. I don’t know for how long.”

She now walks on crutches and requires regular medical treatment. She says war ""rocked my family"". ""I am now a disabled person and my family has been [ruined] economically. I don't want to see that again. Displaced people living in makeshift camps haven't even been returned to their homes. ""No-one can handle another [war]."" Tigray was the epicentre of the conflict. The guns were silenced when two of the main warring groups, Ethiopia's federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the leading political party in the region, signed a peace agreement. This led to the formation of an interim administration tasked with running the region until elections were held. But in recent months there has been a growing power struggle between senior figures within TPLF and Tigray's interim administration. The administration accuses certain TPLF politicians of attempting to seize power by force. Some within the TPLF accuse the interim administration's leadership of failing to support ex-fighters or bring back people displaced by the war. Territories that were once under Tigray's administration before the fighting but are now are under others' control is also a hot issue. Both sides accuse each other of engaging in treasonous activities that involve ""external actors"". There are now concerns the peace agreement could unravel, and even fears over the prospect of a direct conflict between Ethiopia and its neighbour Eritrea. During the Tigray war, Ethiopia's government was supported by Eritrea. But relations have deteriorated between the two countries since the peace deal, which Eritrea did not sign. Since then, there seems to be a feeling in Eritrea that it has become the fall guy for the atrocities reportedly committed during the war. All parties were accused of gross abuses during the civil war - including the mass killing of civilians and widespread sexual violence. Eritrean soldiers were particularly accused of being behind the deaths dozens of the civilians in the historic city of Aksum. Tigray's interim administration says Eritrean troops are still occupying parts of the region's land along shared borders where they continue to commit abuses. Meanwhile Eritrea's information minister called the allegations ""fabricated"" adding the areas in question are ""Eritrean sovereign territories"". Tigrayan officials want the return of these and other disputed areas currently under the control of forces from neighbouring Amhara region, as outlined in the peace deal. Ethiopia's ambitions to have access to the sea is another factor souring relations with Eritrea. There are fears that the two neighbours could return to war six years after they mended their fraught relations. If violence returns to Tigray - or if clashes break out between Ethiopia and Eritrea - the implications will far reaching in an already volatile region. In Mekelle, residents are weary of the prospect of further conflict. ""The youths are tired of violence,"" Tesfay Gebreabgzi, a shoe-shiner in his 20s, tells the BBC. ""During the [civil] war, lots of people had the desire to fight. Now there's only fatigue."" Haimanot Gebremariam, a vegetable vendor in her 50s, says her two children joined the fighting on the Tigrayan side after war broke out in 2020. But while her daughter returned safely, her son sustained permanent wounds. She says she does not want to see a return to ""the dark days"". The situation now ""is very concerning"", she tells the BBC. ""We still live with the trauma and the scar of the previous war. We don't want to shed tears again."" The Tigray region has not fully recovered from the disastrous impact of the conflict. Nearly a million displaced people have still not returned home and some key infrastructure — including schools and health facilities - have not yet been rebuilt. Nonetheless, despite the palpable anxiety, there is a semblance of normality in Mekelle. Businesses and shops are working regularly. And there is not a heavy presence of security forces on the streets. But having lived through one of Africa's deadliest conflicts in recent memory, many are closely following every small development. In one coffee house, young people are glued to their phones, watching clips from recent press statements made by the head of Tigray's interim administration, Getachew Reda, who is currently hundreds of miles away in Addis Ababa for ""consultations"" with federal authorities. In another cafe, a young man said he was waiting to hear what the city's new mayor - who was appointed on Thursday by the dissident TPLF faction - would do to calm the public. Everyone, it seems, is waiting to see what the next days and weeks will bring.",'No-one can handle another war' - Tigrayans fear fresh Ethiopian conflict,Kalkidan Yibeltal,BBC News,2025-03-17T21:55:09,2025-03-17T21:55:09,gemini-2.0-flash

Niger's military rulers have turned their backs on Paris, instead forging ties with fellow juntas in Burkina Faso and Mali, as well as Russia. Shortly before the coup, Niger adopted a new national anthem titled ""For the honor of the fatherland,"" which references the anti-colonial struggle.

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-doubles-down-on-syria-aid-despite-outbreak-of-violence/,"European Union countries will continue to back Syria’s new leadership through both financial aid and sanctions relief despite an outbreak of sectarian violence threatening the country’s stability, the bloc’s foreign ministers said Monday. Germany led the charge by pledging €300 million in support for food, health and other essential services for Syria’s population, as the EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas said the bloc will continue to lift sanctions against Syria. “As Europeans, we stand together for the people of Syria, for a free and peaceful Syria,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock added ahead of an annual donor conference for Syria in Brussels. In a lightning revolution late last year, Syrian rebels — led by former al-Qaeda commander Ahmed al-Sharaa — overthrew Bashar Assad’s decades-long dictatorship, ushering in a fragile new system of governance in a country wracked by religious and ethnic rivalries. In recent days, gunmen from the Alawite Islamic minority, affiliated with Assad, targeted Syrian security personnel, sparking retaliatory and extrajudicial killings by forces allied with al-Sharaa’s new government. Thousands of Alawites have since fled, including to neighboring Lebanon, while hundreds of Alawite civilians have also been killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Kallas insisted the bloc needed to double down on its support for Syrian, while striking a note of caution. “The violence outbreak is really worrying,” she said. “It shows that hope in Syria is really hanging by a thread. This shows that we need to do more to really show that Syria is going in the right direction,” she added. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani is joining the aid conference in Brussels, along with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Kallas and EU foreign ministers. A senior EU official said last week they hoped additional funding would help Syria “turn a page” on 14 years of civil war, amid concerns that a freeze on international aid from the United States could worsen the situation on the ground. The EU has spearheaded efforts to restore diplomatic ties with Syria in recent months, including by lifting sanctions originally imposed against Assad’s regime, with several leaders pushing to send Syrian migrants who lack legal status in Europe back to their home country.",‘Hope in Syria is really hanging by a thread’: EU pledges more aid despite violence,Nicholas Vinocur,POLITICO,2025-03-17T12:10:43,2025-03-17T12:10:53,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/india-new-zealand-free-trade-deal-a3c1515d7b6b07e79fa460f9ef9ee35c,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his New Zealand counterpart, Christopher Luxon, met Monday seeking to deepen their defense and economic ties, a day after the countries announced the revival of negotiations for a free trade agreement. Modi and Luxon met in New Delhi and signed agreements on enhancing cooperation in defense, food processing, pharmaceuticals, renewable energy and critical minerals. Luxon said he held “highly productive meetings” with Modi and other Indian leaders that will improve ties between India and New Zealand. The defense relationship includes joint military training, he said. “New Zealand is committed to doing more with India across a wide range of areas — defense and security, trade and economics, people-to-people ties, education, tourism, sports and culture,” Luxon said at joint press conference with Modi. Luxon was accompanied by business leaders and several parliamentarians on his five-day visit to India. India and New Zealand on Sunday agreed to revive free trade negotiations that have been stalled for more than 10 years. The announcement was made after discussions between New Zealand Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay and his Indian counterpart, Piyush Goyal. It follows India’s recent efforts to broker trade deal agreements with other nations after U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from countries including India. India and the European Union last month agreed to finalize a long-pending free trade agreement by the end of this year. A similar trade deal between India and the United Kingdom is also in the works. India’s Commerce Ministry said the free trade deal between India and New Zealand aims to “achieve balanced outcomes that enhance supply-chain integration and improve market access.” It did not offer other details. Luxon in a statement Sunday said: “It is through trade that we can boost the economies of both our countries, providing more jobs and higher incomes for Kiwis and Indians.” The bilateral trade between India and New Zealand stood at $1.7 billion in 2023-24 financial year. ____ This story corrects bilateral trade figures.",India and New Zealand look to bolster ties after reviving free trade talks,,AP News,2025-03-17T09:05:56,2025-03-17T05:04:42,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hell-fire-shin-bet-chief-bar-ag-says-he-cant-before-legal-review/,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday his intention to dismiss Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, bringing to a head months of growing disagreements between the two men. The premier summoned Bar for an urgent meeting in his office on Sunday evening, Netanyahu’s office said, and informed him that the cabinet would vote for his dismissal later in the week. “At all times, but especially during an existential war such as the one we face, there must be full trust between the prime minister and the head of the Shin Bet,” Netanyahu said in a video statement following his meeting with Bar. “But unfortunately, the situation is the opposite — I do not have such trust. I have ongoing distrust in the head of the Shin Bet, a distrust that has grown over time.” “I want to make clear,” stressed the prime minister, “I am full of appreciation for the men and women of the Shin Bet.” He added that he was “sure that this step is critical for the rehabilitation of the agency, for achieving all our war aims, and for preventing the next disaster.” While Hebrew media reported that a vote on Bar’s dismissal would take place in a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara told Netanyahu later on Sunday night that he could not “initiate a dismissal process” of Bar “until the factual and legal basis underlying your decision is fully examined, as well as your authority to address the matter at this time.” She explained that the reason for this was “the extraordinary sensitivity of the issue, its unprecedented nature, the concern that the process may be tainted by illegality and conflict of interest, and considering that the role of the head of the Shin Bet is not a personal trust position serving the prime minister.” It was not the first time that the attorney general has warned as much. Earlier this month, one of her deputies published a missive stressing that, in the event that the prime minister seeks to dismiss the head of a security body, the move must be reviewed by the attorney general, “in order to ensure its compliance with the necessary procedural and substantive safeguards.” Responding to the attorney general, Justice Minister Yariv Levin argued that “The Shin Bet Law explicitly states that the government has the authority to terminate the service of the head of the agency before the end of their term. This law should be known to the attorney general.” Levin added: “In case anyone is confused, Israel is a democracy, and everyone in it, including the attorney general, is subject to the law.” He said the government “must not surrender to threats or attempts to strip [it] of its authority.” Bar was appointed chief of the Shin Bet in 2021 by then-prime minister Naftali Bennett for a five-year term, but the government has the authority to end his tenure and appoint a new director. In the history of the State of Israel, no Shin Bet director has ever been fired, though two directors resigned before completing their terms. Netanyahu was widely reported to have been working for months to try and oust Bar, as he seeks to pin the blame for the failures surrounding the October 7, 2023, onslaught on the security services, while exonerating his own government. Although Bar intended to eventually resign over his agency’s failure to anticipate the attack, he was said to be pushing back against the effort to oust him, fearing that acquiescence would allow Netanyahu to appoint a loyalist in his stead. He was reportedly planning to remain in his post until all the hostages were returned from Gaza and a state commission of inquiry established to probe the failures surrounding October 7. Demand for ‘personal loyalty’ In a lengthy statement following Netanyahu’s announcement, Bar charged that the decision to fire him was unrelated to the agency’s failures surrounding the October 7 attack, but rather due to a personal issue. “The duty of loyalty placed on the Shin Bet is first and foremost to Israeli citizens. This underlies all my actions and decisions,” Bar said. “The prime minister’s expectation of a duty of personal loyalty, the purpose of which contradicts the public interest, is a fundamentally illegitimate expectation. It is contrary to the Shin Bet law and contrary to the patriotic values that guide the Shin Bet and its members,” he added. Bar noted that the Shin Bet’s internal review of the failures that led to October 7 “pointed to a policy led by the government, and the person who has headed it, for years, with emphasis on the year preceding the massacre. The investigation showed a longstanding and deliberate disregard by the political echelon for the agency’s warnings.” He said he intended to continue in his role until the hostages are returned, until he completes several “sensitive” investigations — likely those related to the Prime Minister’s Office — and until his two potential successors are ready. After some media outlets took that part of the statement to mean Bar was refusing to step down, the Shin Bet clarified that Bar will accept his dismissal if the decision is passed. “As someone who headed the Shin Bet on October 7, I took responsibility for the agency’s part and clearly stated that I intend to act on it before the end of my tenure. That is what is expected of everyone.” Bar said in his statement. “Therefore, it is clear that the intention behind my firing is not related to October 7. The prime minister made it clear that the decision was due to his claim there is ongoing distrust between us. “The Shin Bet, under my leadership, carried out a thorough investigation that pointed to intelligence and internal process failures on October 7, the repair of which has already begun,” he said. “The need to investigate all parties, including government policy and the prime minister, and not just the IDF and the Shin Bet, who have been thoroughly investigated, is required for public security. If I do not insist upon this, with all the personal prices I will pay, I will fail in my role of providing state security,” he stressed. “Investigating to uncover the truth is of utmost importance in the Shin Bet. The public has a right to know what led to the massacre and the collapse of Israel’s security.” Bar said that his “public responsibility” was a key factor in his decision not to resign for the time being, “in light of the [military] escalation potential, the high security tensions and a real possibility of returning to fighting in the Gaza Strip, in which the Shin Bet has a key role.” He said that he had also wanted to “follow through on my personal commitment and the commitment of the agency to the hostages; the completion of a number of sensitive investigations; and the optimal readiness of the two candidates to replace me, at the prime minister’s choice. “In a previous meeting, I informed the prime minister that I intended to complete the above before I resigned from my position in coordination with him, in light of my responsibility to the public, the security of the country, and the functioning of the Shin Bet for the benefit of the State of Israel,” he finished. In response, an anonymous diplomatic official — generally code for statements from the Prime Minister’s Office — launched a broadside against Bar, saying that he was “confused about who reports to whom.” “The Shin Bet chief’s clinging to the altar harms the Shin Bet and the security of the country,” said the official, accusing Bar of defying Netanyahu in his statement, despite the clarification from the Shin Bet that Bar would step down should his ouster be approved. “If anyone had any doubts about the vital need to remove the Shin Bet chief from his position, they have now received the final answer to that with the anti-democratic response in which he says that he, and not the government, will determine when he will end his position,” the official said. Bar “also decided on the night of October 7 who not to wake up and who not to call,” the official claimed. “The Shin Bet chief repeats the lie that he warned the political echelon against the Hamas attack, while the protocols prove the exact opposite,” claimed the official. “On October 1, 2023, seven days before the massacre, the Shin Bet chief said that Hamas was deterred and that it should be given economic benefits in order to maintain calm.” PM’s critics gear up for legal challenge The feud between the two men appeared to come to a head late last week, when Netanyahu accused Bar of “blackmail,” after his direct predecessor in the security agency, Nadav Argaman, claimed to be sitting on a trove of information that would compromise the prime minister, and threatened to make it public if he breaks the law. Argaman was summoned for questioning by the Israel Police on Sunday for his comments to Channel 12, after Netanyahu filed a complaint against him for “threatening and blackmailing a sitting prime minister.” Netanyahu lodged a similar “blackmail” accusation against Bar. He offered limited detail to explain the claim, but claimed the current Shin Bet chief had held a series of off-record briefings with certain reporters in recent days in order to tarnish the premier. Bar’s agency, in turn, declared that the Shin Bet chief “devotes all of his time to security matters, efforts to recover the hostages and the defense of democracy. Any statement to the contrary is devoid of any truth.” The timing of Netanyahu’s announcement drew immediate scrutiny from critics and opposition lawmakers, who pointed out that the Shin Bet is currently investigating several members of staff in the Prime Minister’s Office for alleged ties with Qatar, thus creating a potential conflict of interest. In a furious statement, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid asserted that Netanyahu was firing Bar “for only one reason — the ‘Qatar-gate’ investigation.” “For a year and a half, he saw no reason to fire him, but only when the investigation into Qatar’s infiltration of Netanyahu’s office and the funds transferred to his closest aides began did he suddenly feel an urgency to fire him immediately,” Lapid said. “Netanyahu has once again put his private interests above the good of the country and its security,” Lapid charged. He said his Yesh Atid party would petition the courts against Bar’s ouster, based on the claim that its goal was “to sabotage a serious criminal investigation of the Prime Minister’s Office.” Where opponents criticized the move, however, Netanyahu’s allies lauded it, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich welcoming the “necessary step.” Otzma Yehudit chair Itamar Ben Gvir — who, when serving as national security minister, was accused by Bar of doing “indescribable damage” to Israel — said that the step should have been taken long ago, but that it was “better late than never.” “The right must learn from President Trump to eradicate the ‘Deep State,'” the ultranationalist lawmaker added. Next in line Bar entered the ranks of the Shin Bet as a field agent in 1993, after completing his IDF service in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit. He was tapped to lead the agency’s Operations Division in 2011, became head of the service’s resource development department in 2016, and from 2018 until 2021 served under Argaman as deputy chief. No decision has been made as to Bar’s replacement, although two top Shin Bet officers are reportedly being considered to succeed him. The first officer is known by the first initial of his name in Hebrew, “Shin,” and is the current deputy head of the Shin Bet. He has been in the deputy role for just two months, though he has served in other senior positions in the agency, including chief of staff and chief of the research division. The second officer being considered is “Mem,” the former deputy chief of the agency. Netanyahu recently appointed him as a member of Israel’s hostage negotiation team, after kicking off Bar. He has also served in several other senior roles in the agency. Both “Shin” and “Mem” served in the Shin Bet as field coordinators, involved in recruiting agents and other sources. According to Hebrew-language media reports, Netanyahu may not choose either of the two officers, but instead bring a defense official from outside the organization to head the Shin Bet, or alternatively a former senior Shin Bet officer. Among the former senior Shin Bet officials reportedly being considered to lead the Shin Bet is Meir Ben Shabbat, who is considered close to Netanyahu. Ben Shabbat formerly headed the Shin Bet’s southern district, and later Israel’s National Security Council.",Netanyahu says he’ll fire Shin Bet chief Bar; AG says he can’t without legal review,"Lazar Berman, Emanuel Fabian, Sam Sokol, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-03-16T21:35:52,2025-03-17T09:34:11,gemini-2.0-flash

It continued, “We will take all necessary measures after this dangerous escalation by Hezbollah militias,” SANA reported. Following Sunday’s announcement, Lebanese media reported that the Syrian Army had begun shelling Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, a Hezbollah stronghold. During the shelling, the terror group denied any responsibility for the kidnapping and murder of the soldiers, telling pro-Hezbollah media, “We reiterate what we have previously announced repeatedly: Hezbollah has no connection to any events taking place within Syrian territory.” Ù

Øµpic.twitter.com Hezbollah-aligned media reported that one person had been killed in the clashes. Riyadh’s Al-Arabiya and Al-Hadath said one Syrian army member was killed and two journalists were wounded by a Hezbollah missile on the Syrian border. Lebanese media reported following the clashes, “The Lebanese Army handed over, via the Lebanese Red Cross, the bodies of three Syrian fighters at a border crossing with Syria.” Many analysts pointed to Israel’s victory over the Iranian proxy during the 2024 invasion of Lebanon as a key factor in the eventual collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. Hezbollah was a key pillar of the Assad regime, and Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to prevent the return of Iranian influence. The Syrian Army has clashed with Hezbollah several times since the Assad regime was overthrown in December.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250317005800315,"SEOUL, March 17 (Yonhap) -- Police said Monday they are set to again apply for arrest warrants for two senior officials of the Presidential Security Service (PSS) accused of obstructing investigators' attempt to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. An official from the National Office of Investigation (NOI) said police have finalized preparations to detain acting PSS chief Kim Seong-hoon and Lee Kwang-woo, chief of the PSS's bodyguard division, and are set to present the applications to the prosecution later Monday. Kim and Lee are accused of obstructing the execution of an arrest warrant for Yoon in January, taking unjust personnel actions and instructing subordinates to delete records of phone conversations between Yoon and military commanders involved in the Dec. 3 martial law declaration. The prosecution previously rejected the police's request to seek arrest warrants for Kim three times and Lee two times. However, a warrant review panel from the Seoul High Prosecutors Office sided with the police on March 6, concluding it was appropriate for the prosecution to request arrest warrants for the two. The police have conducted a supplementary investigation to justify the need to detain Kim and Lee, the NOI official said. ycm@yna.co.kr(END)",Police to again file for arrest warrants for 2 Yoon aides,Yoo Cheong-mo,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-17T14:30:24,2025-03-17T14:30:24,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.riotimesonline.com/bolsonaros-copacabana-rally-falls-short-as-legal-troubles-loom/,"Thousands of supporters gathered at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday to back former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The controversial right-wing leader faces serious legal challenges that could derail his political future. Bolsonaro had called for one million people to attend the demonstration. Local media and university monitoring initiatives estimated actual attendance between 18,000 and 26,000 participants. Supporters dressed in Brazil’s yellow-and-green soccer jerseys chanted slogans and held signs demanding “Amnesty, now!” The rally aimed to pressure Congress to grant amnesty to over 400 individuals convicted for their roles in the January 8, 2023 riots. That day, Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasilia just one week after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office. “Elections without Bolsonaro signify a denial of democracy in Brazil,” the former president told the crowd. He firmly denied allegations of plotting a coup after his 2022 election defeat to Lula. Brazil’s Supreme Court will decide on March 25 whether to proceed with trials against Bolsonaro and several associates. Prosecutor General Paulo Gonet formally charged Bolsonaro last month with attempting to overthrow the government and undermine democracy. Bolsonaro’s Copacabana Rally Falls Short as Legal Troubles Loom The indictment describes Bolsonaro as the head of a criminal organization that allegedly plotted to prevent Lula from taking office. Charges include plans to poison Lula and assassinate Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees multiple cases against Bolsonaro. “Nobody buys that,” Bolsonaro said at the rally regarding the accusations. He maintains these charges represent political persecution designed to prevent his return to power. Bolsonaro hopes to emulate his ally Donald Trump’s political comeback despite being barred from public office until 2030. “As of now, I am a candidate,” he told reporters in Brasilia earlier this week. March 25, 2025: Democracy or Persecution? Five Justices Decide Bolsonaro’s Fate Political analyst Andre Rosa suggested the primary aim of Sunday’s protests was for Bolsonaro to “send a signal to his rivals on the right” about his intentions for 2026. His legal team works to challenge his disqualification from running for office. If convicted on all charges, the former president could face more than 40 years in prison. The case might conclude by early 2026, reshaping Brazil’s political landscape ahead of the next presidential election.

https://apnews.com/article/carney-canada-uk-france-trump-arctic-60993a6e738f797977ef544dc5857ea3,"MONTREAL (AP) — New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is heading to Paris and London on Monday to seek alliances as he deals with U.S. President Donald Trump’s attacks on Canada’s sovereignty and economy. Carney is purposely making his first foreign trip to the capital cities of the two countries that shaped Canada’s early existence. At his swearing-in ceremony on Friday, Carney noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples, French, English and Indigenous, and said Canada is fundamentally different from America and will “never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States.” A senior government government official briefed reporters on the plane before picking up Carney in Montreal and said the purpose of the trip is to double down on partnerships on with Canada’s two founding countries. The official said Canada is a “good friend of the United States but we all know what is going on.” “The Trump factor is the reason for the trip. The Trump factor towers over everything else Carney must deal with,” said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. Carney, a former central banker who turned 60 on Sunday, will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday and later travel to London to sit down with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in an effort to diversify trade and perhaps coordinate a response to Trump’s tariffs. He will also meet with King Charles III, the head of state in Canada. The trip to England is a bit a homecoming, as Carney is a former governor of the Bank of England, the first noncitizen to be named to the role in the bank’s 300-plus-year history. Carney then travels to the edge of Canada’s Arctic to “reaffirm Canada’s Arctic security and sovereignty” before returning to Ottawa where he’s expected to call an election within days. Carney has said he’s ready to meet with Trump if he shows respect for Canadian sovereignty. He said he doesn’t plan to visit Washington at the moment but hopes to have a phone call with the president soon. Sweeping tariffs of 25% and Trump’s talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can. Carney’s government is reviewing the purchase of U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump’s trade war. The governing Liberal Party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war and repeatedly has said Canada should become the 51st state. Now the party and its new leader could come out on top. Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said Carney is wise not to visit Trump. “There’s no point in going to Washington,” Bothwell said. “As (former Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau’s treatment shows, all that results in is a crude attempt by Trump to humiliate his guests.” Bothwell said that Trump demands respect, “but it’s often a one-way street, asking others to set aside their self-respect to bend to his will.” Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said it is absolutely essential that Canada diversify trade amidst the ongoing trade war with the United States. More than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. Béland said Arctic sovereignty is also a key issue for Canada. “President Trump’s aggressive talk about both Canada and Greenland and the apparent rapprochement between Russia, a strong Arctic power, and the United States under Trump have increased anxieties about our control over this remote yet highly strategic region,” Béland said.",New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney seeks alliances in Europe as he deals with Trump | AP News,Rob Gillies,AP News,2025-03-16T12:27:23,2025-03-16T19:12:46,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-to-eu-colleagues-stop-buying-american-buy-european/,"PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron wants to lead a charm offensive to convince EU countries to stop buying U.S. defense equipment and buy French and European instead. Macron, who has been calling for years to direct defense spending toward EU products, said he wants to convince other European countries that are currently ""buying American"" to shift to local options. ""My intention is to go and convince European states that have become accustomed to buying American,"" he said on Saturday in an interview with several French media including Nice-Matin and Le Parisien. ""Those who buy Patriot should be offered the new-generation Franco-Italian SAMP Those who buy the F-35, should be offered the Rafale. That's the way to increase the rate of production,"" he said. Macron's comments come as European NATO members have become even more dependent on U.S. weapons than ever before. This month, the Netherlands and Belgium confirmed they would still buy American-made F-35 fighter jets, while Portugal is wobbling about replacing its U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets with more modern F-35s because of ""the recent position of the United States, in the context of NATO."" Macron said he has asked French defense companies to cut red tape and reduce costs to become a more attractive option, Nice-Matin reported. The French president also clarified what a possible deployment of European troops to help Ukraine could look like. The goal is to ""deploy a few thousand men per nation, at key points, to carry out training programs” and ""show our support over the long term,"" he said. Macron said that the conditions laid down by Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree on a ceasefire in Ukraine ""are unacceptable."" ""This would mean a partial invasion of Ukraine and a freeze on the conflict, without offering any security or guarantees for the future,"" Macron said. Macron announced for ""the coming weeks"" a reform of the so-called ""Service National Universel"" — a voluntary service for people aged between 15 and 17 that includes sporting activities, civic education and a stint at a state organization or nongovernmental organization — ""to meet the nation's needs and the priorities we have identified."" The French president, however, ruled out a comeback of compulsory military service.","Macron to EU colleagues: Stop buying American, buy European",Giorgio Leali,POLITICO,2025-03-16T13:16:37,2025-03-16T15:51:20,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250316-southern-african-bloc-decides-to-end-military-mission-in-drc,"The southern African regional bloc has decided to end its military deployment to the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where it lost at least a dozen soldiers in conflict there in January. The 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) held an extraordinary summit to discuss the conflict in eastern DRC, held via video conference this week. The situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was the main topic on the agenda, with Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi attending the meeting. The participants at the summit decided to terminate the mandate of SAMIDRC, the SADC Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and directed the commencement of a phased withdrawal of SAMIDRC troops from the DRC, the group said in a statement at the end of the meeting. The SAMIDRC was sent to the region in December 2023 to help the government of the DRC, a SADC member, restore peace and security. But South Africa lost 14 soldiers in the eastern DRC conflict in January. Most were from the SAMIDRC mission but at least two were deployed as part of a separate United Nations peacekeeping mission. Three Malawian troops in the SADC deployment were also killed. Officials did not comment on the size of the military deployment, which also includes soldiers from Tanzania. The bulk of the troops come from South Africa, which is estimated to have sent at least 1,000 troops. Calls have been mounting in South Africa for the soldiers still in the DRC to be withdrawn, with reports that they are confined to their base by M23 fighters. Regional conflict The conflict in the area of South and North Kivus has seen some three decades of unrest and claimed millions of lives. The M23 has seized swathes of the mineral-rich and volatile eastern DRC, including the key cities of Goma and Bukavu, in a lightning advance since January. DRC's neighbours are trying to mobilise diplomacy to put an end to this deadly fighting. The virtual SADC summit came a day after Angola announced that peace talks between the DRC and the Rwanda-backed M23 armed group would begin next week. Angola indicates M23 rebels are ready to begin direct peace talks on 18 March Opening Thursday's summit, SADC chairperson and Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa called for a ""greater sense of urgency"" in efforts to end the conflict, which he said could cause instability beyond the DRC's borders. Inclusive dialogue was essential, he said, adding that the review of the SAMIDRC mandate was ""timely"". Angola's presidential office hopes that talks between the DRC and M23 will begin next Tuesday. ""Following the steps taken by the Angolan mediation... delegations from the Democratic Republic of Congo and the M23 will begin direct peace talks on 18Â March in the city of Luanda,"" it said. Angolan President Joao Lourenco had earlier met DRC President Felix Tshisekedi, who had previously refused to engage in dialogue with the M23 as demanded by Rwanda. Angola pushes for direct talks between Kinshasa and M23 in DRC crisis A report by UN experts has said Rwanda maintains some 4,000 troops in the eastern DRC in support of the M23. Rwanda denies providing the group with military assistance. The DRC says the M23's advance has killed more than 7,000 people since the beginning of 2025. These figures remain to be verified independently. (with AFP)",Southern African bloc decides to end military mission in DRC,RFI,RFI,2025-03-16T04:40:46,2025-03-16T04:40:46,gemini-2.0-flash

 With its tomato patches and grazing cattle, the Ivory Coast village of Kimbirila-Nord hardly looks like a front line of the global fight against extremism. But after jihadis attacked a nearby community in Mali five years ago and set up a base in a forest straddling the border, the U.S. committed to spending $20 million to counter the spread of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group here and in dozens of other villages. The Trump administration’s sweeping foreign aid cuts mean that support is now gone, even as violence in Mali and other countries in the Sahel region south of the Sahara has reached record levels and sent tens of thousands refugees streaming into northern Ivory Coast. Locals worry they have been abandoned. Diplomats and aid officials said the termination of aid jeopardizes counterterrorism efforts and weakens U.S. influence in a part of the world where some countries have turned to Russian mercenaries for help. In Kimbirila-Nord, U.S. funding, among other things, helped young people get job training, built parks for cattle to graze so they are no longer stolen by jihadis on Malian territory, and helped establish an information-sharing system so residents can flag violent encounters to each other and state services. “What attracts young people to extremists is poverty and hunger,” said Yacouba Doumbia, 78-year-old chief of Kimbirila-Nord. “There was a very dangerous moment in 2020. The project came at the right time, and allowed us to protect ourselves.”

“Seize a narrow prevention window”

Over the last decade, West Africa has been shaken by extremist uprisings and military coups. Groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have conquered large areas and killed thousands in the Sahel and have been spreading into wealthier West African coastal states, such as Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo. In 2019, President Donald Trump signed the Global Fragility Act that led to the initiatives in northern Ivory Coast. The U.S. goal in this area was to “seize a narrowing prevention window,” according to this year’s congressional report about the implementation of the bipartisan legislation.

Experts say local concerns help drive the popularity of extremist groups: competition for land and resources, exclusion, marginalization and lack of economic opportunities. Across the region, Islamic extremists have recruited among groups marginalized and neglected by central governments. “Ivory Coast is one of the few countries that still resist the terrorist threat in the Sahel,” said a U.N. official working in the country who was not authorized to speak on the matter publicly. “If we do not continue to support border communities, a minor issue could send them into the arms of extremists.” Trump issued an executive order in January directing a freeze on foreign assistance and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad. He charged that much of foreign aid was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.

“Everyone was just looking out for themselves”

In 2020, when the jihadis struck a Malian village 10 kilometers (6 miles) away, Kimbirila-Nord in many ways fit the description of a community susceptible to extremism. The lives of Malians and Ivorians were intertwined. People crossed the border freely, making it easy for extremists, who like residents spoke Bambara, to access Kimbirila-Nord. Many residents did not have identity cards and few spoke French, leaving them with no access to states services or official information. Different ethnic groups lived next to each other but were divided by conflicts over scarce natural resources and suspicions toward the state. And young people did not have opportunities to make money. “We were very scared” when the extremists attacked, said Aminata Doumbia, the head of the village’s female farmers cooperative. “Everyone was just looking out for themselves.” The Ivorian government runs a program that provides professional training, grants and microloans. But access is difficult in villages such as Kimbirila-Nord. Kimbirila-Nord is home to refugees from Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea. Sifata Berte, 23, fled there with his family two years ago from Mali. He is not eligible for the government-run program, but got training through the project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and now works as an apprentice in an iron workshop. Other things the USAID-funded project set up included a network of community radios in local languages, so people could get access to information. It also used mobile government trucks to help tens of thousands of people across the region get their identity documents. And it brought people together with microcredit cooperatives and with a special committee of ranchers and farmers that helps resolve tensions over land. “It’s thanks to the project that we can sleep at night,” Doumbia, the village chief, said. “We learned how to be together.” Equal Access International, an international nonprofit, designed and implemented the U.S.-funded project. The USAID project also has been the only direct source of information on the ground in northern Ivory Coast on violent events for the U.S.-based Armed Conflict and Location & Event Data Project, the main provider of data on violence in the Sahel.

The village had big plans

Ivory Coast became known as a target for extremists in 2016, when an attack on the seaside resort of Grand Bassam killed tourists. In 2021, a string of attacks occurred near the country’s northern border, but the violence has been largely contained after Ivorian authorities, Western governments and aid groups rushed into this impoverished and isolated part of the country with military build up and development projects. In 2024, the U.S. Africa Command provided over $65 million to projects in Ivory Coast, most of which “focused on counterterrorism and border security” in the northern part of the country, according to the group’s website. The Pentagon said in a statement that it was “not aware of any budget cuts that have undermined counterterrorism training or partnership programs in Africa.” Ivory Coast has the second-highest GDP per capita in West Africa, but according to the U.N. it remains one of the world’s least developed countries. Many in remote villages like Kimbirila-Nord do not have access to running water. “At first we thought that we only had to solve these problems with a military solution,” Famy Rene, the prefect of Korhogo, the region’s capital, said. “But we saw that this was not enough. We had to put in place programs that strengthen the resilience of the population.” Residents of Kimbirila-Nord had big plans before the U.S. froze aid. The U.S. was supposed to finance the first well in the village, help create a collective farm, and expand vocational training, Now they fear they have been left alone to deal with extremists. “If you forget, they will come back,” said Doumbia, the village chief. “As long as there is war on the other side of the border, we must remain on a high alert.” ___ For more on Africa and development:  ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y62jrwgwo,"A SpaceX capsule carrying a new crew has docked at the International Space Station (ISS), paving the way for astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to come home. The pair were due to be on the ISS for only eight days, but because of technical issues with the experimental spacecraft they arrived on, they have been there for more than nine months. The astronauts are due to begin their journey back to Earth later this week. Steve Stich, manager of Nasa's commercial crew programme said he was delighted at the prospect. ""Butch and Suni have done a great job and we are excited to bring them back,"" he said. Live footage showed the SpaceX Crew Dragon docking with the ISS and opening a hatch. Shortly after 0545 GMT, the astronauts embraced and hugged their counterparts. The astronauts, along with their ISS workmates, Nasa's Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, will be relieved by four astronauts, from Russia, Japan and two from the US. There will be a two-day handover after which the old crew are due to begin their journey back to Earth. But there could be a small further delay, as they wait for conditions on Earth to be right for a safe re-entry of the returning capsule, according to Dana Weigel, manager, of the ISS programme. ""Weather always has to cooperate, so we'll take our time over that if it is not favourable,"" she told reporters. Ms Weigel explained that the astronauts had begun getting ready for the handover last week. ""Butch rang a ceremonial bell as Suni handed over command to cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin,"" she said. The astronauts have consistently said that they have been happy to be on board the space station, with Suni Williams describing it as her ""happy place"". But Dr Simeon Barber, of the Open University, told BBC News that there would likely have been a personal cost. ""When you are sent on a work trip that is supposed to last a week, you are not expecting it to take the best part of a year,"" he said. ""This extended stay in space will have disrupted family life, things will have happened back home that they will have missed out on, so there will have been a period of upheaval."" Butch and Suni arrived at the ISS at the beginning of June 2024 to test an experimental spacecraft called Starliner, which was built by the aerospace firm Boeing, a rival to SpaceX. The mission had been delayed by several years because of technical issues in the spacecraft's development, and there were problems during its launch and docking on to the ISS. This included issues with some of Starliner's thrusters, which would be needed to slow the spacecraft for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, and leaks of helium gas in the propulsion system. Nasa decided that it would not take even a small risk in bringing back Butch and Suni on Starliner, when they had the option of returning them on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Nasa decided the best option was to do this during a scheduled crew rotation, even though it would mean keeping the astronauts on the space station for several months. Boeing has consistently argued that it would have been safe to bring Butch and Suni back on Starliner, and were unhappy about the decision to use a rival's capsule instead, which will be ""embarrassing"" for Boeing, according to Dr Barber. ""It's not a good look for Boeing to see astronauts they took into space come back in a competitor's craft."" Both President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have said that Butch and Suni could have been brought home sooner, most recently in a joint interview with Fox News in February. President Trump states: ""They got left in space."" When the interviewer, Sean Hannity, elaborates, saying ""They were supposed to be there eight days. They're there almost 300,"" Mr Trump responds with one word: ""Biden."" Mr Musk follows up asserting: ""They were left up there for political reasons."" The assertion is denied by Nasa's Steve Stitch. ""We looked at a wide range of options and worked hand-in-hand with SpaceX to look at what was the best thing to do overall and when we laid all that out the best option was to have the one we are embarking upon,"" he said. That decision was supported by Dr Libby Jackson, who is head of space at the Science Museum in London and worked at Europe's control centre for the ISS. ""Butch and Suni's wellbeing would always have been at the very forefront of everybody's minds as the decisions were being made for how best to deal with the circumstances that they were presented,"" she said. ""Nasa made those decisions based on good technical reasons, on programmatic reasons, and found the right solution that has kept Butch and Suni safe. ""I really look forward to seeing them return to Earth, safe and sound, along with the rest of their crewmates.""",SpaceX capsule docks with ISS as stranded Nasa astronauts prepare return,Pallab Ghosh,BBC News,2025-03-14T19:24:54,2025-03-16T02:38:25,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.dw.com/en/greenland-hundreds-protest-against-trumps-takeover-plans/a-71933403,"Hundreds of Greenlanders took to the streets on Saturday to protest against US President Donald Trump's stated goal of taking control of their island. Video footage showed crowds gathered in the capital, Nuuk, waving Greenland's flag and holding signs with messages such as ""Respect Greenland's sovereignty,"" ""We are not	for sale""	and ""Make America Go Away""	— a play on Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again."" Rallies were also taking place in other towns on the island. Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the center-right Demokraatit party that won this week's parliamentary election, was joined by outgoing Prime Minister Mute B. Egede to lead protesters toward the US consulate on Nuuk's	outskirts. ""We want to be ourselves, and our autonomy and freedom will never be put up for debate,""	Nielsen told the Danish Broadcasting Corporation during the rally. ""There is not the slightest chance that I will talk to Trump about Greenland becoming part of the US. Greenland will be Greenland,""	he said. Speaking to	Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq on Saturday, Egede called the US president's approach ""completely	unacceptable."" What has Trump said about Greenland? Over the past few months, Trump has repeatedly voiced his interest in taking control of Greenland. The US president raised the idea again on Thursday during a meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte at the White House. When asked by a reporter about a possible annexation, Trump said: ""I think it will happen.""	 He went on to say that the territory was fundamental to US national security, stressing that the US already has military bases there. The strategically important Arctic island is home to just 57,000 inhabitants and is a self-governing territory of Denmark. What has Greenland's response been? Lawmakers in Greenland have vehemently opposed Trump's plans to make the island part of the US. On Friday, the leaders of the five parties in Greenland's parliament issued a joint statement rejecting Trump's comments. ""We —	all party chairmen — cannot accept the repeated statements on annexation and control of Greenland,"" they said.

https://apnews.com/article/tornadoes-wildfires-deaths-eb53f6b2463a96b18a08ca9e2db266ab,"PIEDMONT, Mo. (AP) — Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 32 people as more severe weather was expected late Saturday. The number of fatalities increased after the Kansas Highway Patrol reported eight people died in a highway pileup caused by a dust storm in Sherman County on Friday. At least 50 vehicles were involved. In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves announced that six people died in three counties and three more people were missing. There were 29 injuries across the state, he added in a nighttime post on the social platform X. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as scattered twisters overnight killed at least 12, authorities said. The deaths included a man whose home was ripped apart by a tornado. “It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field,” said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. “The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.” AP correspondent Julie Walker reports well over a dozen deaths in a monster storm across the US. Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri. “It was a very rough deal last night,” he said the following day, surrounded by uprooted trees and splintered homes. “It’s really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night.” Henderson said they rescued his aunt from a bedroom that was the only one left standing, taking her out through a window. They also carried out a man who had a broken arm and leg. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties. “We have teams out surveying the damage from last night’s tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She, Reeves and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Kemp said he was doing so in anticipation of severe weather moving in later in the day. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths came as the massive storm system unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area that is home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state, and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) burned in the state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. Experts said it’s not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Significant tornadoes continued to hit Saturday, with the region at highest risk stretching from from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the Storm Prediction Center said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched a massive twister from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, away as it struck an area about half a mile (0.8 km) near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded video of snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles. “The amount of damage was catastrophic,” Dillon said. “It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over — everything was destroyed.” Paradise Ranch said via Facebook that all staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the RV park itself. “Homes and everything were destroyed all around it,” she said. “Schools and buildings are just completely gone.” Some imagery from the extreme weather went viral online. Tad Peters and his father, Richard Peters, had pulled over to fuel up their pickup truck in Rolla, Missouri, on Friday night when they heard tornado sirens and saw other motorists fleeing the interstate to park. “Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it’s here. It’s here,” Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. “Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn ...” His father then rolled up the window.

https://www.dw.com/en/hungarys-orban-vows-crackdown-on-media-ngos/a-71932327,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told a crowd of his supporters in Budapest on Saturday that he planned to crack down on politicians and journalists who receive funding from abroad. Speaking at an
 event marking Hungary's national day, he said it was time to eliminate what he called a ""shadow army"" of NGOs, journalists, judges and politicians who he said were serving the interests of the EU and a ""liberal American empire."" ""After today's celebrations, comes the big Easter cleaning up as the bugs have survived the winter,"" Orban said. ""We will eliminate the whole shadow army ... who have supported the empire for money, against their own country."" The right-wing populist, an ally of Donald Trump, has taken a tougher stance against foreign-funded media and NGOs since the US president's inauguration in January. He has also welcomed recent steps taken by Washington to dismantle USAID, claiming the development agency was being used to fund liberal causes in Hungary and undermine his government. What measures could Orban take? Last month, Orban announced plans to target foreign funding channeled to Hungarian media. His Fidesz party this week submitted constitutional changes that would allow the expulsion of Hungarian dual citizens if they are deemed to pose a threat to Hungary's sovereignty or national security. Orban's party has also sought to target the LGBTQ+ community, saying the annual Budapest Pride event would be banned in public starting this year. Orban has frequently clashed with the European Union. In his speech on Saturday, he reiterated his opposition to Ukraine joining the bloc and criticized Brussels for continuing to supply Kyiv with military aid in the war with Russia. ""The rulers of Europe decided that Ukraine must continue the war at all costs, and it will get a fast EU membership in exchange, using our money,"" he said. ""We can only have one answer to that: a Union but without Ukraine."" Will Orban survive elections in 2026? Orban, who has ruled Hungary uninterrupted for 15 years, is currently facing pressure from an opposition movement led by moderate conservative and former Fidesz member Peter Magyar. Magyar's upstart Tisza party held a demonstration in Budapest later on Saturday that was attended by tens of thousands of people. Magyar told the crowd he would end Orban's rule and pledged to make Hungary part of a strong Europe. ""Our time has come,"" he said. Independent opinion polls show Tisza neck-and-neck or even several points ahead of Fidesz, with the next general elections due in about one year's time. Magyar has built a strong following in a relatively short period of time by focusing on Hungary's cost-of-living crisis and what he describes as deep-seated corruption among ruling party elites.

https://www.dw.com/en/serbia-protesters-flood-belgrade-with-vucic-under-pressure/a-71933147,"Protesters from all over Serbia
hours were marching in Belgrade on Saturday as the government struggles to stem the monthslong outrage over the deadly fall of the Novi Sad railway station canopy in November. Gatherings were being held in multiple locations in the Serbian capital. Farmers, bikers, military veterans and other groups joined
the demonstrations, with approach routes to key sites clogged by large crowds. ""In front of the parliament there is already a large number of people, and we have seen several processions by bikers and tractor drivers,"" DW correspondent Sanja Klajic reported from the scene. To follow DW's live blog on the Belgrade protests in Serbian, click here. NGO says rally likely 'biggest in Belgrade's history' The number of participants was not immediately clear. The Interior Ministry estimated around 107,000 protesters, although some independent media gave a much higher number in
what is likely the largest protest at least since the ouster of autocrat Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. Serbian NGO Arhiv javnih skupova, which specializes in
counting protesters at
various events, gave a much higher estimate, saying that between 275,000 and 325,000 attended the event. ""Everything indicates this is the biggest rally in Belgrade's history,"" they
said in an online post.
They also published videos from downtown Belgrade showing immense crowds. Unexplained noise startles protesters during solemn silence At least one person was severely injured after being beaten by several people during protests, though circumstances remain unclear. Also an unexplained loud noise, similar to an incoming projectile or a falling aircraft, was heard during 15-minute silence honoring 15 victims of the Novi Sad tragedy, startling the crowd and causing protesters to briefly flee one of Belgrade's streets. While the origin of the noise remains unclear, independent news outlet N1 quoted military analyst Aleksandar Radic as saying that the sound was caused by an acoustic weapon. Radic
described it as a ""sonic cannon,"" which is part of the arsenal available to the Serbian security services. An opposition lawmaker made a similar claim about the source of the noise, N1 reported. ""The only goal of this act is a brutal demonstration of force, a proof of arrogance, motivated by the hatred toward one's own people,"" Radic told N1. However, the police soon denied using
the sonic cannon, saying that this action ""would not have been in accordance with the law."" What are the protests in Serbia about? The Saturday march is seen as a culmination of a monthslong protest movement spearheaded by Serbian students. The protesters are demanding accountability for the deaths of 15 people in Novi Sad who were killed by falling rubble as the outdoor roof section of a train station caved in on them. The train station had been recently renovated under murky circumstances, with the involvement of Chinese companies and businesses with alleged ties to the ruling Progressive Party (SNS). Serbian officials initially claimed no work had been done on the canopy, but later admitted this part of the building was also altered during the reconstruction. The protesters accuse the government of withholding key documents linked to the renovation effort. The government, led by strongman President Aleksandar Vucic, insists all necessary papers have already been made public. In a wider sense, the movement has also encapsulated a whole range of complaints against Vucic and his government, including allegations of widespread corruption, nepotism, mismanaging natural resources, voter fraud, media control and muddled responses to previous deadly incidents linked to government officials. Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Novi Sad mayor Milan Djuric have already resigned amid protests. What did Vucic say? Commenting on the protests on Saturday evening, Vucic said 56 people were injured and 22 detained during the protest on suspicion of vandalism and assault, but no one sustained life-threatening injuries. He said the protest carried ""a huge negative energy, anger and rage directed toward the authorities."" ""We did not raise the nightstick today,"" he told reporters during a press conference. His tone seemed to be more conciliatory
than in recent days, when he
warned of possible violence and repeated his claims that Western intelligence services were behind the unrest. ""I won't allow the street to set the rules,"" he said on Friday. Days ahead of the Saturday march, Vucic warned that officials will ""arrest all troublemakers."" ""We have a state and we will show you the state,"" he said. Rally ends without major clashes Thousands of students and other participants arrived in
Belgrade on Friday evening amid fears that the government would attempt to block transport links to the city. On Saturday, police blocked a major bridge and public transport was suspended. Still, as of Saturday evening, there were no reports of a large-scale police clampdown against protesters, or major clashes between anti-government protesters and mysterious masked men whom the protesters believe are associated with the government. Vucic, who became the country's undisputed political leader in 2014, is considered a nationalist but has pursued a carefully balanced foreign policy and boasts
close working relationships with the US and the EU, as well as with Moscow and Beijing. Edited by: Saim DuÅ¡an Inayatullah",Serbia: Protesters flood Belgrade with Vucic under pressure,Darko Janjevic,Deutsche Welle,2025-03-15T14:08:33,2025-03-17T08:42:52,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/china-g7-maritime-security-2ca16405f82352a62a41eef10866d4f1,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China has lashed out at accusations it is endangering maritime safety made by top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies in a joint statement, saying the G7 members are “filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions.” Even for China’s generally overheated diplomatic language, the statement issued Saturday was unusually vitriolic, although it did not threaten any retaliation. In the Friday statement that sparked the Chinese response, the G7 said, “We condemn China’s illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions that seek unilaterally to alter the status quo in such a way as to risk undermining the stability of regions, including through land reclaimations, and building of outposts, as well as their use for military purpose.” “We reaffirm that our basic policies on Taiwan remain unchanged and emphasize the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to international security and prosperity,” the statement said, referring to the crucial waterway separating China from the self-governing island republic it claims as its own territory. In the response issued through its embassy in Canada, where the two-day G7 meeting was held in La Malbaie, Quebec, China said the statement “repeated the same old rhetoric, ignored facts and China’s solemn position, grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs, and blatantly smeared China.” “The statements are filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions to suppress and attack China. China strongly deplores and opposes	this and has lodged solemn representations with the Canadian side,” the statement said. China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, through which passes around $5 trillion in global trade. It has dismissed and occasionally clashed with other countries that claim parts of the sea, especially the Philippines, a U.S. treaty partner. China is not a member of the G7 but closely follows all comments and references to its international status made by international organizations or in foreign countries, responding to criticism with caustic language. China has firmly rejected a U.N.-affiliated court’s ruling that invalidated most of its claims to the South China Sea and says its claim to Taiwan is non-negotiable, even if China has to use force against the island. China routinely sends ships and warplanes into airspace and waters near Taiwan, built military bases on human-made islands in the South China Sea and recently staged surprise live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand for which it gave no advance notice. Australia’s aviation authority said it learned of the drills just 30 minutes before they began, not from Beijing but from a pilot flying in the area, and 49 commercial flights were forced to alter their flight paths in response. The G7 did not mention the drills in its statement. “We share a growing concern at recent, unjustifiable efforts to restrict such freedom and to expand jurisdiction through use of force and other forms of coercion, including across the Taiwan Strait, and in the South China Sea, the Red Sea, and the Black Sea,” the G7 said. China has the world’s largest navy, including three aircraft carriers, with a fourth on the way. It has a base in Sheikhdom of Djibouti in the Horn of Africa and consistently has expanded the range of the force.",China lashes out at G7 over statements on maritime security,Christopher Bodeen,AP News,2025-03-15T08:41:03,2025-03-15T08:53:03,gemini-2.0-flash

Russia ""does not give the impression it sincerely wants peace,"" Macron said in a statement provided to AFP following a Saturday morning video conference of countries backing Ukraine organised by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. On the contrary, Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""escalating the fighting"" and ""wants to get everything, then negotiate,"" he said. ""Russia must respond clearly and the pressure must be clear, in conjunction with the United States, to obtain this ceasefire,"" he added. In a statement released later Saturday, his office said Macron would Canada's new prime minister Mark Carney on Monday to discuss the war in Ukraine and ""other international crises"". Since returning to the White House in January, US President Donald Trump has stressed his desire to end the three-year old conflict, and has made a spectacular rapprochement with Vladimir Putin. After a very public falling out between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House last month, Kyiv has worked to restore relations. It has backed Washington's proposed a 30-day ceasefire, which Russia has not accepted. 'Moment of truth'""This is a moment of truth because if Russia does not sincerely commit to peace, President Trump will toughen sanctions and retaliation, and so that will completely change the dynamic,"" Macron said in a interview Friday with French regional papers that was posted late Saturday. He said planning was accelerating among countries willing to provide security guarantees for Ukraine following any eventual ceasefire, such as France and Britain. Military leaders from some 30 countries met in Paris on March 11 to discuss plans for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, and will meet again Thursday in Britain. ""Several European countries, and indeed non-European ones, have expressed their willingness to join"" a possible deployment to Ukraine to secure a future peace agreement with Russia, said Macron. This would involve ""a few thousand troops"" per state, deployed at key points, to conduct training programmes and ""show our long-term support"", he told the regional papers. Moscow has firmly opposed such a deployment. But Macron said: ""If Ukraine requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up to Russia to accept or reject them.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-846181,"The United States struck Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday evening in a message to Iran, at a time when the administration is proposing to open negotiations on its nuclear program, a US official told The Jerusalem Post. The strikes will last ""days, possible weeks"" an official told Reuters. The Houthi-run health ministry reported that the US strikes have killed over 23 people and wounded more than 20 others in Yemen on Saturday. An Israeli official told Walla that the US informed Israel in advance of the attacks on Yemen. The air and naval strikes hit the Houthisâ	ms radars, air defenses, and missile and drone systems, The New York Times reported. The Houthi TV channel said that an electrical installation in the city of Dahyan, in the Saada province in northwestern Yemen, was also struck resulting in a loss of electricity across the city. US President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that â	stoday, I have ordered the United States military to launch decisive and powerful military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.â	mtTrump also slammed his predecessor, former president Joe Biden, for his â	mpathetically weakâ	mt handling of the Houthi threat. â	mtFunded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our troops and allies. These relentless assaults have cost the US and world economy many billions of dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,â	mt the president stressed. â	mtThe Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated,â	mt Trump wrote. â	mtWe will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective. The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important waterways of the world, grinding vast swaths of global commerce to a halt, and attacking the core principle of freedom of navigation upon which international trade and commerce depends.â	mt The president concluded the post with a message to the Houthis and to Iran. â	mtTo all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DONâ	mtT, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!â	mt he wrote. â	mtTo Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American people, their president, who has received one of the largest mandates in presidential history, or worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we wonâ	mtt be nice about it!â	mt The strikeâ	ms goal is to open international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, which have been disrupted by the Houthis.Houthi-run Al Masirah TV previously said on Saturday that an attack targeted the Yemeni capital Sanaâ	msa, without providing further details. The Iran-backed Houthi terror group paused attacks on Israel, which it began in support of Hamas, during the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. However, the Houthis announced last week that they would recommence attacks in response to Israelâ	ms blockade on aid in Gaza. This is a developing story.

https://apnews.com/article/trump-yemen-houthis-rebels-attack-airstrike-11b0e080b3982542dd621338a7b18afd,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Iran-backed rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said at least 31 people were killed, and Trump’s national security adviser said Sunday that the strikes had successfully targeted “multiple” Houthi leaders. “Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,” Trump said in a social media post. “No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.” He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S. leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran’s advancing nuclear program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out,” Trump national security adviser Michael Waltz said on ABC’s “This Week.” that aired Sunday. The Houthis reported explosions in their territory Saturday evening, in the capital of Sanaa and the northern province of Saada, the rebels’ stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia, with more airstrikes reported in those areas early Sunday. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The Houthis also reported airstrikes early Sunday on the provinces of Hodeida, Bayda, and Marib. The Houthi-run Health Ministry said early Sunday that the death toll had climbed to 31, including women and children. Anees al-Asbahi, a spokesperson for the ministry, said Sunday that another 101 people were wounded. A U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won’t deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. “Sanaa will remain Gaza’s shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges,” he added on social media. Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump’s claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes “false and misleading.” The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel’s latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of “additional consequences” for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn’t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when this ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemen’s decade-long stalemated war that’s torn apart the Arab world’s poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa’s northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children. “The explosions were very strong,” said Abdallah al-Alffi. “It was like an earthquake.” The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels’ political bureau, located in a densely populated area. The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel’s military declined to comment. However, Saturday’s operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration. Such broad-based missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region.  The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday’s mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. “These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said. ___ Baldor reported from Washington and Magdy reported from Cairo.

https://apnews.com/article/tornadoes-wildfires-deaths-eb53f6b2463a96b18a08ca9e2db266ab,"PIEDMONT, Mo. (AP) — Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 32 people as more severe weather was expected late Saturday. The number of fatalities increased after the Kansas Highway Patrol reported eight people died in a highway pileup caused by a dust storm in Sherman County on Friday. At least 50 vehicles were involved. In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves announced that six people died in three counties and three more people were missing. There were 29 injuries across the state, he added in a nighttime post on the social platform X. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as scattered twisters overnight killed at least 12, authorities said. The deaths included a man whose home was ripped apart by a tornado. “It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field,” said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. “The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.” AP correspondent Julie Walker reports well over a dozen deaths in a monster storm across the US. Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri. “It was a very rough deal last night,” he said the following day, surrounded by uprooted trees and splintered homes. “It’s really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night.” Henderson said they rescued his aunt from a bedroom that was the only one left standing, taking her out through a window. They also carried out a man who had a broken arm and leg. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties. “We have teams out surveying the damage from last night’s tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She, Reeves and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Kemp said he was doing so in anticipation of severe weather moving in later in the day. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths came as the massive storm system unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area that is home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state, and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) burned in the state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. Experts said it’s not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Significant tornadoes continued to hit Saturday, with the region at highest risk stretching from from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the Storm Prediction Center said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched a massive twister from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, away as it struck an area about half a mile (0.8 km) near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded video of snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles. “The amount of damage was catastrophic,” Dillon said. “It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over — everything was destroyed.” Paradise Ranch said via Facebook that all staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the RV park itself. “Homes and everything were destroyed all around it,” she said. “Schools and buildings are just completely gone.” Some imagery from the extreme weather went viral online. Tad Peters and his father, Richard Peters, had pulled over to fuel up their pickup truck in Rolla, Missouri, on Friday night when they heard tornado sirens and saw other motorists fleeing the interstate to park. “Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it’s here. It’s here,” Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. “Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn ...” His father then rolled up the window. The two were headed to Indiana for a weightlifting competition but decided to head back home to Norman, Oklahoma, about six hours away, where they encountered wildfires. Wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. ___ Walker reported from New York, and Reynolds from Louisville, Kentucky.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/15/2003833460,"China and Russia yesterday joined Iran in denouncing US sanctions, and backed efforts to restore a landmark nuclear deal with Tehran that US President Donald Trump abandoned in his first term and now wants to replace. The three countries — all sanctioned by the US to varying degrees — stressed the need to end unilateral restrictions and urged the resumption of international talks over Iran’s atomic activities at a meeting in Beijing, a joint statement said. Russia and China were key participants in the agreement signed during former US president Barack Obama’s administration that restricted Iran’s nuclear activity in exchange for sanctions relief, before Trump’s withdrawal in 2018. Photo: AFP As the standoff drags on, Iran has expanded its stocks of near-bomb grade enriched uranium, while Washington has toughened its sanctions. Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu (馬朝旭) hosted yesterday’s meeting, which was also attended by Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Ryabkov and his Iranian counterpart, Kazem Gharibabadi. A separate meeting included Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi (王毅). “Political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue based on the principle of mutual respect remains the only viable and practical option,” Ma told reporters after the meeting. Last week, Trump reiterated his interest in striking a new nuclear deal with Iran and warned the only alternative for the Islamic republic was to face military action. The Beijing gathering follows a flurry of diplomatic activity on Iran’s nuclear program as world powers try to evade another crisis, at a time when wars in the Middle East and Ukraine are posing risks to energy prices and the global economy. Iran has already had at least two rounds of preliminary nuclear talks with diplomats from the UK, France and Germany in Geneva in recent months. Trump also wrote a letter addressed to the Iranian leadership, which was received in Tehran on Wednesday via a top official from the United Arab Emirates. The contents of the missive are not known and there has been no official response. The participants in Beijing emphasized the need for all countries to abstain from actions that would undermine the inspection activities of the International Atomic Energy Agency monitors still working in Iran. The UN watchdog last month reported a surge in nuclear activity in Iran over the past few months. “The situation has reached a critical juncture again. We must buy time for peace, resolve disputes through political and diplomatic means, and oppose the use of force and illegal sanctions,” Wang told reporters.","China, Russia unite behind Tehran to challenge US plans",Bloomberg,台北時報,2025-03-15T00:00:00,2025-03-14T23:40:13,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/head-of-isis-in-iraq-and-syria-killed-in-airstrike-during-us-iraqi-joint-operation/,"BAGHDAD (AP) — The head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been killed in Iraq in an operation by members of the Iraqi national intelligence service along with US-led coalition forces, the Iraqi prime minister announced Friday. “The Iraqis continue their impressive victories over the forces of darkness and terrorism,” Prime Minister Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said in a statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. Abdallah Maki Mosleh al-Rifai, or “Abu Khadija,” was “deputy caliph” of the militant group and as “one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world,” the statement said. On his Truth Social platform Friday night, US President Donald Trump said: “Today the fugitive leader of ISIS in Iraq was killed. He was relentlessly hunted down by our intrepid warfighters” in coordination with the Iraqi government and the Kurdish regional government. “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!” Trump posted. A security official said the operation was carried out by an airstrike in Anbar province, in western Iraq. A second official said the operation took place Thursday night but that al-Rifai’s death was confirmed Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. CENTCOM Forces Kill ISIS Chief of Global Operations Who Also Served as ISIS #2 On March 13, U.S. Central Command forces, in cooperation with Iraqi Intelligence and Security Forces, conducted a precision airstrike in Al Anbar Province, Iraq, that killed the Global ISIS #2 leader,… The announcement came on the same day as the first visit by Syria’s top diplomat to Iraq, during which the two countries pledged to work together to combat ISIS. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein said at a news conference that “there are common challenges facing Syrian and Iraqi society, and especially the terrorists of IS.” He said the officials had spoken “in detail about the movements of ISIS, whether on the Syrian-Iraqi border, inside Syria or inside Iraq” during the visit. Hussein referred to an operations room formed by Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon at a recent meeting in Amman to confront IS, and said it would soon begin work. The relationship between Iraq and Syria is somewhat fraught after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Al-Sudani came to power with the support of a coalition of Iran-backed factions, and Tehran was a major backer of Assad. The current interim president of Syria, Ahmad al-Sharaa, was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani and fought as an al-Qaida militant in Iraq after the US invasion of 2003, and later fought against Assad’s government in Syria. But Syrian interim Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani focused on the historic ties between the two countries. “Throughout history, Baghdad and Damascus have been the capitals of the Arab and Islamic world, sharing knowledge, culture and economy,” he said. Strengthening the partnership between the two countries “will not only benefit our peoples, but will also contribute to the stability of the region, making us less dependent on external powers and better able to determine our own destiny,” he said. The operation and the visit come at a time when Iraqi officials are anxious about an ISIS resurgence in the wake of the fall of Assad in Syria. While Syria’s new rulers – led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham – have pursued IS cells since taking power, some fear a breakdown in overall security that could allow the group to stage a resurgence. The US and Iraq announced an agreement last year to wind down the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by September 2025, with US forces departing some bases where they have stationed troops during a two-decade-long military presence in the country. When the agreement was reached to end the coalition’s mission in Iraq, Iraqi political leaders said the threat of ISIS was under control and they no longer needed Washington’s help to beat back the remaining cells. But the fall of Assad in December led some to reassess that stance, including members of the Coordination Framework, a coalition of mainly Shiite, Iran-allied political parties that brought current Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani to power in late 2022.",Head of ISIS in Iraq and Syria killed in airstrike during US-Iraqi joint operation,Qassim Abdul-Zahra,The Times of Israel,2025-03-15T05:57:07,2025-03-15T14:15:03,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250315003400315?section=national/diplomacy,"SEOUL, March 15 (Yonhap) -- Seoul takes the U.S. Department of Energy's decision to put South Korea on a ""sensitive country"" list ""seriously,"" the foreign ministry said Saturday, while vowing to actively consult with Washington on the matter. The Department of Energy (DOE) confirmed it designated South Korea in the lowest category of its ""sensitive and other designated countries list"" (SCL) in early January under the previous Biden administration. If the addition goes into effect on April 15 as scheduled, it could make it hard for South Korea to join U.S. initiatives on advanced technologies, such as nuclear energy, artificial intelligence and quantum technology. ""(The government) will actively negotiate with (the United States) to prevent the designation from negatively affecting cooperation on energy and science technology between South Korea and the U.S.,"" the ministry official said. The ministry has faced criticism over its apparent diplomatic failure to avert the DOE designation, as it is believed to have been unaware of the move until recently. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul told the National Assembly on Tuesday that the ministry is working to grasp the situation after having obtained such information through an ""informal"" channel. Apparently mindful of criticism about Seoul's diplomatic incompetency, the official suggested Saturday that it was difficult to learn of related developments, saying the measure was apparently reviewed internally within the DOE with no information shared. But the official declined to answer a question about when the ministry became aware of Seoul's addition to the SCL, reiterating that it informally grasped the DOE's move before a related news report first emerged Monday. ""We will continue to contact high-level officials at the DOE, the State Department and other related agencies and actively consult with them on the matter in order to rectify the list,"" the official said.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-15-2025-b54c0c11c4d7f0ca52653edb033c70f5,"CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Saturday it will only release an American-Israeli and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel implements their ceasefire agreement, calling it an “exceptional deal” aimed at getting the truce back on track. Israeli airstrikes meanwhile killed nine people in the Gaza Strip who the military identified as militants, allegations denied by a U.K.-based aid group that said eight of its workers were killed. A senior Hamas official said long-delayed talks over the ceasefire’s second phase would need to begin the day of the release and last no longer than 50 days. Israel also would need to stop barring the entry of humanitarian aid and withdraw from a strategic corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Israel has said it won’t pull out from the corridor, citing the need to combat weapons smuggling. Hamas would also demand the release of more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. Edan Alexander, 21, who grew up in New Jersey, was abducted from his military base during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. He is the last living U.S. citizen held in Gaza. Hamas still has 59 hostages, 35 believed to be dead. Speaking at a protest camp set up last week outside Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, relatives of hostages said Netanyahu was “violating the agreement he signed and abandoning the hostages in Gaza.” “You want to sacrifice our children for the pleasures of power,” said Itzik Horn, father of hostage Eitan and freed hostage Iair. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late Saturday told negotiators to prepare for the continuation of talks regarding the release of hostages, his office said. Two Israeli airstrikes in the northern town of Beit Lahiya near the border killed at least nine people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Palestinian Journalists’ Protection Center, a local watchdog, said the dead included three Palestinian journalists who were documenting aid distribution. Local health official Fares Awad identified one as Mahmoud Islim, who was operating a drone. The Israeli military said it struck two people operating a drone that it said posed a threat to soldiers in the area. It said it launched another strike at a group of people who came to collect the drone equipment, identifying all those targeted as militants. The army later released the names of six people it said were militants killed in the strikes, including one accused of taking part in the Oct. 7 attack and another who it said had been released as part of the ceasefire. The military said two others, including Islim, were militants posing as journalists. The UK-based Al Khair Foundation said that eight of its workers were killed in the strikes. It denied the Israeli military’s allegations that those killed were militants or had connections to Hamas. Hamas in a statement called the attack a “serious escalation” showing Israel’s attempts to “sabotage any opportunity” to implement the ceasefire agreement. Also Saturday, Israel’s military said it removed a platoon of soldiers from Gaza who were seen in a video on social media opening fire during a celebration of the Jewish holiday of Purim. The video shows soldiers shooting, apparently randomly, while another performs the customary reading of the Book of Esther. The military said the soldiers “will face disciplinary measures.” No major fighting has occurred in Gaza since the ceasefire took hold on Jan. 19, but Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military said had entered unauthorized areas, engaged in militant activities or otherwise violated the truce. The United States said it presented on Wednesday a proposal to extend the ceasefire a few weeks as the sides negotiate a permanent truce. It said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making “entirely impractical” demands. Talks continued in Egypt, which along with Qatar has served as mediators with Hamas in the indirect talks with Israel. Israel and Hamas were to begin negotiations on the ceasefire’s second phase in early February, but only preparatory talks have been held. In Phase Two, Hamas would release all remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting truce. The first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone along Gaza’s border and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid. After the first phase ended early this month, Israel said it had agreed to a new U.S. proposal in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages in return for a vague commitment to negotiate a lasting ceasefire. Hamas rejected that offer. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that he held in-depth discussions with the negotiating team and security officials on Saturday evening. Afterward, he told the negotiating team to prepare for continued talks as per the mediator’s response to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff’s proposal, the statement said. For two weeks, Israel has barred the delivery of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, and cut electricity to the territory a week ago, to pressure Hamas to accept the new proposal. The southern city of Rafah, on the Gaza-Egypt border, said it could no longer provide fuel needed to pump water from dozens of wells. Ahmed al-Sufi, head of the municipality, said fuel shortages caused by the Israeli siege have forced it to “suspend essential services, threatening the lives of thousands.” The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displaced most of the population and left nearly everyone dependent on international aid. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. Most have been released in deals, while Israel rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel’s military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Associated Press writer Natalie Melzer in Nahariya, Israel contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at ",Hamas says it will only release American-Israeli hostage if ceasefire deal is implemented,SAMY MAGDY,AP News,2025-03-15T07:13:24,2025-03-16T02:21:51,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250315001500315,"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Yonhap) -- The placement of South Korea on the U.S. Department of Energy's ""sensitive country"" list might pose a tricky test to the bilateral alliance, experts said Friday, as the decadeslong partnership is facing headwinds, including President Donald Trump's growing tariff pressure. The department confirmed the preceding Biden administration added the Asian ally to the ""lowest"" category of the DOE Sensitive and Other Designated Countries List in early January -- a move that called into question Seoul's diplomatic capacity at a time of political uncertainty triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment over his martial law bid in December. Barring an agreement between the allies, the designation is set to take effect April 15. The list involves a group of countries subject to stricter scrutiny when access is requested to DOE research institutions or other facilities for technology cooperation or other purposes. It includes North Korea, Russia and China. ""Obviously designating South Korea on this 'sensitive' list would be troubling for the alliance, signaling distrust on the part of the U.S. and disbelief from the Koreans that their closest ally would put them in a category usually reserved more for adversaries than allies,"" Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation chair at the Brookings Institution's Center for East Asia Policy Studies, told Yonhap News Agency via email. It remains unknown why the Biden administration put South Korea, long a stalwart treaty ally, to the list. The addition came as South Korea was thrust into political turmoil due to Yoon's short-lived martial law imposition and his subsequent impeachment -- a saga that raised questions over whether Seoul and Washington can maintain as smooth and strong policy coordination as they did before. It also proceeded as public calls for South Korea's own nuclear program have persisted, with North Korea defiantly doubling down on its own nuclear program amid fears Russia will provide nuclear technology to Pyongyang under a bilateral ""comprehensive strategic partnership"" treaty. In early 2023, Yoon hinted at the possibility of South Korea seeking an independent nuclear program, apparently drawing concerns in Washington, as Pyongyang ramped up tensions on the Korean Peninsula with a ratcheted-up frequency of provocative acts. But Yoon reaffirmed Seoul's commitment to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the ""Washington Declaration"" in April that year, as the declaration involved a stronger U.S. nuclear deterrence commitment to South Korea, including the establishment of the Nuclear Consultative Group, the allies' key deterrence mechanism. Public calls for South Korea's nuclear armament, however, did not relent. Last year's survey by the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification found that 66 percent of South Koreans were in favor of their country going nuclear. Patrick Cronin, chair for Asia-Pacific security at the Washington-based Hudson Institute, said that the Biden administration's decision to add Korea to the list might be an effort to guard against the possibility of Trump backing Seoul's potential nuclearization. ""If the Biden administration made this designation, it may have been a way of handcuffing the Trump administration from leaning into possible support for a South Korean nuclear weapon capability,"" Cronin told Yonhap News Agency via email. The designation, albeit not effectuated, spawned concerns that it could serve as a stumbling block to the two countries' efforts to broaden their partnership into a ""global comprehensive strategic"" alliance that covers not only security but also new realms like emerging technologies. Expectations have been growing particularly for nuclear reactor cooperation as Seoul and Washington signed an arrangement on principles concerning nuclear exports and cooperation earlier this year, with the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and U.S.-based Westinghouse settling an intellectual property rights dispute. Cronin voiced his opposition to the designation of South Korea. ""First, I do not think South Korea should be placed on this list. If a South Korean government was determined to create an independent nuclear weapon capability, then there should be a U.S. policy debate about what steps to take. In that context, sensitive country designation is one of several possible responses,"" Cronin said. ""Second, putting South Korea on this list, which complicates permits for technology cooperation, makes little sense while South Korea is dealing with a suspended president and a pending Constitutional Court verdict that could trigger a quick election,"" he added. In response to a question from Yonhap News Agency, a DOE spokesperson said that inclusion on the list does not necessarily indicate an ""adversarial"" relationship with the U.S. But many expect it could pose a psychological impediment to South Koreans seeking closer technology cooperation with the U.S. ""Many designated countries are those we regularly cooperate with on a variety of energy, science, technology, counterterrorism and nonproliferation issues,"" the DOE spokesperson told Yonhap News Agency. The official added: ""The designation does not prohibit scientific or technical cooperation. These visits and cooperation undergo an internal review beforehand."" Many observers said the designation would put to the test Seoul's diplomacy aimed at preventing the designation from going into effect next month, while some pointed out the apparent failure to preemptively avert the designation during the Biden administration. ""It is correct that the preceding Biden administration put South Korea on the list,"" a diplomatic source in Washington said. ""I understand that (South Korean authorities) are in consultations with the U.S. side to redress that before it goes into effect on April 15."" The designation came in the midst of brewing trade tensions between Seoul and Washington. Trump plans to levy ""reciprocal tariffs"" on South Korea and other trading partners on April 2, which will be pegged to countries' tariffs on U.S. products, their non-tariff barriers and other elements like exchange rate policies. Trump recently claimed South Korea's average tariff is four times higher than that of the U.S. -- a remark that laid bare his seeming perception of the Asian ally as an unfair trading partner. He is also moving to impose new tariffs on cars, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber derivatives -- items South Korea exports to the U.S. On top of that, concerns have continued over the possibility of Trump demanding a sharp increase in Seoul's share of the cost for stationing the 28,500-strong U.S. Forces Korea, as he argued that America has helped South Korea ""militarily"" and ""in so many other ways."" sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)",(News Focus) U.S. designation of S.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250315000900315,"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Yonhap) -- Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo said Friday that he has called for the Trump administration to grant South Korea tariff exemptions and ensure the Asian ally will be treated in a ""non-discriminatory"" way. Cheong met U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington earlier in the day, as President Donald Trump plans to roll out ""reciprocal tariffs"" on April 2, which will be pegged to U.S. trading partners' duties on American goods, non-tariff barriers and other elements, including exchange rate policies. ""I have requested tariff exemptions for South Korea, or at least non-discriminatory treatment (to Korea) compared with major countries,"" Cheong said during a meeting with Korean correspondents in Washington. Cheong also said he highlighted that reciprocal tariffs on South Korea should not be based on Trump's recent remark in a congressional address claiming that Korea's average tariff is four times higher than that of the U.S. Seoul has countered Trump's claim by saying South Korea's average tariff rate on U.S. products stands at less than 1 percent under a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA). South Korea's average tariff on its most-favored nations (MFNs) stands at around 13.4 percent -- compared with the U.S.' 3.3 percent on its MFNs -- but that rate is not applicable to countries with free trade deals with Asia's fourth-largest economy. ""The U.S. side was also aware that in accordance with the FTA, both countries' tariffs are near zero percent,"" he said. ""While sharing the understanding about the usefulness of the Korea-U.S. FTA as a framework for comprehensive economic cooperation, (the two sides) agreed to explore a reasonable and mutually beneficial way through continued working-level consultations on tariff measures,"" Cheong said. Moreover, the minister used his meeting with the USTR to underscore the need for exempting South Korean steel products from 25 percent tariffs that went into effect earlier this week. ""I explained that South Korean steel exports do not pose a threat to the security of the U.S. industry, and that they are rather contributing to the supply chain stabilization and downstream industrial competitiveness through the supply of items whose production falls short in the U.S.,"" he said. sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)",Seoul trade minister renews calls for USTR to grant S.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg815277g5o,"Sudan has suspended all imports from Kenya in protest after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are fighting the army in a two-year civil war, were hosted in Nairobi. Last month, the RSF and its allied political and armed groups signed a founding charter in Kenya expressing the intention to form a parallel government in Sudan. Sudan's military government said the import ban was to preserve the country's sovereignty and ""protect its national security"". The war-torn country imports several products from Kenya including tea, food items and pharmaceutical products. ""The import of all products coming from Kenya through all ports, crossings, airports, and ports will be suspended as of this day until further notice,"" a decree issued by Sudan's ministry of trade stated. It ordered ""all relevant authorities to enforce the ban immediately"". Tensions between Kenya and Sudan have been escalating for several months. Kenyan President William Ruto has faced widespread criticism at home for his perceived close ties with the RSF. Last month, Sudan recalled its ambassador to Kenya in protest against Nairobi's  involvement in a ""conspiracy to establish a government"" for the RSF. Sudan called Kenya's hosting of RSF meetings ""tantamount to an act of hostility"". But Kenya defended its role, stating that hosting the meetings was part of efforts to find solutions to end the war in Sudan ""without any ulterior motives"". Both countries have traditionally enjoyed strong trade relations, with Kenya being an important partner for Sudan, particularly in agriculture and manufacturing. Kenya exports a range of goods to Sudan, with tea being its most significant export, followed by coffee, tobacco, and other products such as soaps, electrical equipment, and pharmaceuticals. Tea is one of Kenya's most significant foreign exchange earners, and this move is expected to disrupt both trade flows and the broader economy. ""This ban will be a big blow, and foreign exchange will take a hit. It would mean less foreign exchange and greater exposure to financial services. It has a ripple effect that extends beyond just trade,"" economist Ken Gichinga told the BBC. Sudan is one of the top five destinations for Kenyan tea and producers are worried about the effects of the ban. The East African Tea Trade Association (EATTA) expressed concerns over ongoing contracts and shipments stuck in transit. ""Teas are currently at Port Sudan, and several containers already dispatched are now stranded in the high seas,"" it said. Large stocks in Kenya's port city of Mombasa also cannot be shipped out. ""This will result in unfathomable losses incurred by buyers and will trickle down to producers and farmers,"" the association warned. RSF advisor El Basha Tebeig sought to reassure Kenya, stating on X that the group would ""guarantee the smooth passage of Kenyan goods into Sudan"" in those areas it controls. But Port Sudan is in the hands of the army and has become the seat of the military government because of the fighting in Khartoum. The Kenyan government is yet to comment but Agriculture Minister Mutahi Kagwe recently said his country was exploring diplomatic avenues to address the market access challenges in Sudan. Kenya's tea exports to Sudan have already been affected by the conflict there. A recent report showed a 12% reduction in Kenyan tea exports to Sudan over the past year. The war in Sudan, which began in April 2023, has caused widespread destruction, disrupting supply chains and limiting the ability of businesses to operate normally. Ports and border crossings, vital for trade, have been either damaged or obstructed by the violence, significantly reducing the flow of goods between Sudan and its neighbours, including Kenya. The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including the capital Khartoum - with thousands of people killed and more than 12 million displaced, according to the United Nations.",Sudan bans all Kenyan imports after it hosted RSF,Akisa Wandera,BBC News,2025-03-14T08:18:21,2025-03-14T12:59:37,gemini-2.0-flash

Netanyahu is convening top aides and senior ministers on Saturday night to hear a briefing from Israel’s negotiators, who will return to Israel later today, says his office, and to decide on next steps.","PM’s office blasts Hamas for rejecting ‘Witkoff proposal,’ says hostage team called back from Doha",Lazar Berman,The Times of Israel,2025-03-14T13:12:38,2025-03-14T13:12:38,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-says-it-has-agreed-to-release-us-israeli-hostage-edan-alexander-bodies-of-4-slain-dual-nationals/,"Hamas in an official statement says it has agreed to a proposal to release hostage soldier Edan Alexander, who is a US citizen, as well as the bodies of four other slain captives who are dual nationals. Alexander is a soldier who was stationed near the Gaza Strip on the morning of October 7 when he was taken captive by Hamas. Hamas does not provide the names of the four slain dual nationals. The terror group says it “affirms its complete readiness to initiate negotiations and reach a comprehensive agreement on the issues of the second phase while calling for the occupation (Israel) to fully implement its obligations.” The Hamas statement indicates that the terror group has accepted a proposal thot was discussed during direct talks with US hostage envoy Adam Boehler, which had been held in recent weeks. Those talks infuriated Jerusalem, which wasn’t fully kept in the loop, didn’t like that Boehler was discussing Israeli concessions without its knowledge and feared it would lead Washington to abandon the remaining Israeli hostages after such a deal was reached. But Boehler’s remit is specifically to try and free American hostages worldwide and his effort was approved by US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff when the main track of negotiations was stuck due to Israel’s refusal to accept the terms of the current deal’s second phase. There hadn’t appeared to have been a breakthrough in Boehler’s direct talks — which ended after Israel learned about them and leaked their existence to the media, according to two US officials — and the hostage negotiations had returned to their original channel led by Witkoff with mediation from Qatar and Egypt in Doha. Hamas’s decision to suddenly accept a proposal to release the American hostages points to an attempt to divide the US and Israel by daring Jerusalem to deny an opportunity to free American hostages.","Hamas says it has agreed to release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, bodies of 4 slain dual nationals","Emanuel Fabian, Jacob Magid",The Times of Israel,2025-03-14T07:03:52,2025-03-14T10:37:58,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250314002651320?section=national/politics,"(ATTN: ADDS more info in paras 7-8; CHANGES photo)By Kim Han-joo SEOUL, March 14 (Yonhap) -- Acting President Choi Sang-mok on Friday demanded the National Assembly reconsider an opposition-led bill calling for a special counsel probe into President Yoon Suk Yeol over an alleged influence-peddling scandal linked to the 2022 parliamentary by-elections. The bill, passed by the Democratic Party-controlled parliament on Feb. 27, seeks an investigation into allegations that Myung Tae-kyun, a self-proclaimed power broker, received approximately 76 million won (US$52,300) from former ruling party lawmaker Kim Young-sun in exchange for helping secure her nomination in the by-elections. Acting President Choi Sang-mok speaks during a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on March 14, 2025. (Yonhap) The special counsel would also investigate allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee were involved in the nomination process for both the 2022 local elections and last year's parliamentary elections. ""The scope of the investigation is excessively broad and lacks clarity, raising concerns about potential violations of the constitutional principles of precision and proportionality,"" Choi said while presiding over an extraordinary Cabinet meeting. Myung allegedly secured Kim Young-sun's nomination in return for conducting public opinion polls favorable to Yoon ahead of the 2022 presidential election. Both Myung and the former People Power Party lawmaker, Kim Young-sun, have already been indicted. ""In a situation where a prosecution investigation is gaining momentum, introducing a special counsel probe goes against the fundamental purpose of the special prosecutor system,"" Choi added. Choi urged the prosecution to take the matter seriously, seemingly addressing opposition parties' accusations that the prosecution was downplaying the case. ""The prosecution must stake its credibility on this investigation and conduct a swift and impartial inquiry into the relevant allegations without providing anyone any sanctuary,"" Choi said. It marks the eighth time Choi has exercised veto power since assuming interim leadership in December, including a special counsel probe bill into Yoon over his imposition of martial law. The Democratic Party has intensified its criticism of Choi, accusing him of repeatedly using his veto authority to block key opposition-led bills. Typically, motions of this nature are approved during Cabinet meetings chaired by the prime minister and then sent to the president for endorsement before being returned to the National Assembly for a revote. khj@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) Acting president vetoes bill on special counsel probe into Yoon over election influence-peddling,Kim Han-joo,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-14T09:57:53,2025-03-14T09:57:53,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250314-armenia-azerbaijan-announce-agreement-to-sign-peace-deal,"Armenia and Azerbaijan on Thursday said they had agreed to sign a peace deal after decades of conflict, with Armenia agreeing to surrender its claim over the primarily Armenian-populated Karabakh region. A deal to normalise ties would be a major breakthrough in a region where Russia, the European Union, the United States and Turkey all jostle for influence. Baku and Yerevan fought two wars for control of Azerbaijan's Armenian-populated region of Karabakh, at the end of the Soviet Union and again in 2020, before Azerbaijan seized the entire area in a 24-hour offensive in September 2023. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan have repeatedly said a comprehensive peace deal to end their long-standing conflict is within reach, but previous talks had failed to reach consensus on a draft agreement. ""The negotiation process on the text of the peace agreement with Armenia has been concluded,"" Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov told reporters. Armenia's foreign ministry later confirmed that in a statement, saying: ""Negotiations on the draft agreement have been concluded"" and ""the Peace Agreement is ready for signing."" Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan hailed it as an ""important event"", saying Yerevan was ""ready to begin discussions on the place and time for signing the peace agreement"". France's President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the announcement, writing on X that ""there are now no remaining obstacles to the signing of a peace treaty ... which should pave the way for a lasting peace in the South Caucasus."" But in a hint at enduring tensions, Armenia criticised Azerbaijan for making a statement unilaterally rather than issuing a joint one. Pashinyan has recognised Baku's sovereignty over Karabakh after three decades of Armenian separatist rule, a move seen as a crucial first step towards a normalisation of relations. Armenia also last year returned to Azerbaijan four border villages it had seized decades earlier. Nearly all ethnic Armenians – more than 100,000 people –fled Karabakh after its takeover by Baku. Tensions over the conflict have also driven a wedge between Armenia and Russia, with Yerevan accusing its ally of not doing enough to support it. Armenia last year suspended its participation in the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) over the bloc's failure to come to its aid in the conflict with Azerbaijan. Russia, the United States and the European Union have all tried to play a mediating role at various times in the conflict. Pashinyan said Thursday that two points in the draft peace agreement had remained unresolved up to now. One key issue was ""non-deployment of third-party forces"" along the countries' shared border, he said. There were also disagreements over plans for both sides to mutually withdraw legal cases from international judicial bodies. The two countries have been locked in legal battles at the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court and the European Court of Human Rights over allegations of rights violations committed before, during and after their armed conflicts. Azerbaijan's ""next expectation from Armenia is constitutional amendments"", Bayramov said. Baku is demanding that Armenia remove from its constitution a reference to its declaration of independence, which asserts territorial claims over Karabakh. Any such amendments to Armenia's constitution would require a referendum.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-trump-somaliland-sudan-somalia-575e03aaa0c487bae2fbadfdef8f5ca3,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for moving Palestinians uprooted from the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump’s proposed postwar plan, American and Israeli officials told The Associated Press. The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the U.S. and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal also casts doubt on Trump’s stated goal of resettling Gaza’s Palestinians in a “beautiful area.” Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the U.S., while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told The Associated Press that they were not aware of any contacts. Under Trump’s plan, Gaza’s more than 2 million people would be permanently sent elsewhere. He has proposed the U.S. would take ownership of the territory, oversee a lengthy cleanup process and develop it as a real estate project. The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel’s ultranationalist fringe. But since Trump presented the idea at a White House meeting last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed it as a “ bold vision.” Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Rights groups have said forcing or pressuring the Palestinians to leave could be a potential war crime. Still, the White House says Trump “stands by his vision.” Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed the contacts with Somalia and Somaliland, while the Americans confirmed Sudan as well. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place. Separate outreach from the U.S. and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the U.S. officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions. Israel and the U.S. have a variety of incentives — financial, diplomatic and security — to offer these potential partners. It is a formula that Trump used five years ago when he brokered the Abraham Accords — a series of mutually beneficial diplomatic accords between Israel and four Arab countries. The White House declined to comment on the outreach efforts. The offices of Netanyahu and Ron Dermer, the Israeli Cabinet minister and Netanyahu confidant who has been leading Israel’s postwar planning, also had no comment. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of what he calls “voluntary” emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take in Palestinians. He also said Israel is preparing a “very large emigration department” within its Defense Ministry. Here is a closer look at the places the officials say have been approached. Sudan The North African country was among the four Abraham Accord nations that agreed to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020. As part of the deal, the U.S. removed Sudan from its list of state supporters of terrorism, a move that gave the country access to international loans and global legitimacy. But relations with Israel never took off as Sudan plunged into civil war between government forces and the RSF paramilitary group. The conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the U.N. and rights groups. The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, and then-President Joe Biden’s administration in January said the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide. The U.S. and Israel would be hard-pressed to persuade Palestinians to leave Gaza, particularly to such a troubled country. But they could offer incentives to the Khartoum government, including debt relief, weapons, technology and diplomatic support. Two Sudanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter, confirmed that the Trump administration has approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians. One of them said the contacts began even before Trump’s inauguration with offers of military assistance against the RSF, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives. Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. “This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,” said one official. ”No one opened this matter again.” Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan told an Arab leaders’ summit last week in Cairo that his country “categorically rejects” any plan that aims to transfer “the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name.” Somaliland Somaliland, a territory of over 3 million people in the Horn of Africa, seceded from Somalia over 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognized as an independent state. Somalia considers Somaliland part of its territory. Somaliland’s new president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, has made international recognition a priority. An American official involved in the efforts confirmed that the U.S. was “having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the U.S. in exchange for recognition.” The possibility of U.S. recognition could provide an incentive for Abdullahi to back away from the territory’s solidarity with the Palestinians. The United Arab Emirates, another Abraham Accord country that has developed strong ties with Israel, once had a military base in Somaliland and maintains commercial interests there, including a port. The territory’s strategic location, in the Gulf of Aden waterway near Yemen, home to the Houthi rebel group, could also make it a valuable ally. Over the years, Somaliland has been lauded for its relatively stable political environment, contrasting sharply with Somalia’s ongoing struggles amid deadly attacks by al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab. Since 1991, Somaliland has maintained its own government, currency and security structures. Still, it has one of the lowest income levels in the world. An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said his government has not been approached and is not in talks about taking in Palestinians. Somalia Somalia has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, often hosting peaceful protests on its streets in support of them. The country joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump’s plan and seems like an unlikely destination for Palestinians, even if they did agree to move. Sambu Chepkorir, a lawyer and conflict researcher in Nairobi, Kenya, said it is difficult to understand why Somalia would want to host Palestinians given the country’s strong support for Palestinian self-rule. “The realignments keep changing, and so maybe there is a hidden agenda,” Chepkorir said. A Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the country had not been approached about taking in Palestinians from Gaza and there had been no discussions about it. ___ Lee reported from Washington, and Magdy reported from Cairo.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250314000252315?section=national/diplomacy,"(ATTN: ADDS more details in paras 5-6; CHANGES photo)By Song Sang-ho WASHINGTON, March 13 (Yonhap) -- U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday expressed his desire to reestablish the relationship that he had with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during his first term, boasting that he ""got along great"" with the reclusive leader and still has a ""great"" relationship with him. During a press availability, Trump made the remarks, describing the North Korean leader as a ""nuclear power"" with ""a lot of nuclear weapons,"" as his administration is pursuing the goal of the ""complete denuclearization"" of North Korea. ""Well, I would,"" Trump said, responding to a reporter's question of whether he has a plan to reestablish the relationship he had under his first presidential mandate. ""I had a great relationship with Kim Jong-un (of) North Korea. If I wasn't elected, if Hillary got in, you would have had a nuclear war with North Korea,"" he added, as he sat next to North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House for talks. His remarks added to expectations that he would seek to revive his direct personal diplomacy with Kim, which led to three meetings between the two -- the first in Singapore in June 2018, another in Hanoi in February 2019 and the other in the inter-Korean truce village of Panmunjom in June 2019. Days after his inauguration in January, Trump said he will reach out to Kim again, calling the ruler a ""smart guy,"" though speculation persisted that Pyongyang's appetite for engagement with Washington might have lessened as it has relied on Moscow for food, fuel, military support and other help. Trump claimed he continues to maintain a good relationship with Kim. ""I have a great relationship with Kim Jong-un, and we'll see what happens,"" he said. ""But certainly, he's a nuclear power."" It is not the first time that he has depicted North Korea as a nuclear power -- a term that U.S. officials had mostly refrained from publicly using given that the term could be construed as a U.S. recognition of Pyongyang's possession of nuclear weapons. Shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 20, he used the term to refer to North Korea, spawning speculation about his intentions behind the nuclear power labeling. Speculation eased later as the White House said his administration is pursuing the complete denuclearization of North Korea. Highlighting his hope to bring down the number of nuclear weapons in the world, Trump pointed out North Korea's sizable nuclear arsenal. ""Kim Jong-un has a lot of nuclear weapons by the way ... a lot and others do also,"" he said. ""You have India. You have Pakistan. You have others that have them."" The president credited the first Trump administration with South Korea's successful hosting of the Olympics, where North Korea partook, apparently in reference to the PyeongChang Olympics held in February 2018. ""They (North Koreans) asked for a meeting. And then we met. And the meeting caused the Olympics, which was South Korea, to become a tremendous success,"" he said. ""Nobody was buying tickets for the Olympics because they didn't want to be nuked, and I met and not only did the Olympics become successful, but North Korea participated in the Olympics ... That was something that was an achievement of the Trump administration ... great achievement."" It is unclear what meeting he referred to as his first summit with Kim took place in June 2018 months after the Olympics. sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)","(2nd LD) Trump voices desire to reestablish ties with Kim Jong-un, says Kim has 'a lot of' nuclear arms",Song Sang-ho,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-14T06:31:14,2025-03-14T06:31:14,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20250313-trump-to-dr-congo-s-rescue-what-we-know-about-a-proposed-us-congolese-mining-deal,"The US and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo or DRC) may soon begin formal negotiations on a critical minerals deal. Discussions are under way, the Congolese presidency confirmed to FRANCE 24, on US access to the mineral resources of the vast central African country, which has some of the world's largest reserves of cobalt, coltan, copper and lithium that are vital for cutting-edge technologies in defence, energy transition and other sectors. The US State Department last week said it was open to a mining partnership in DR Congo and has confirmed that preliminary discussions had begun. Congolese authorities hope to block neighbouring Rwanda, which supports the M23 rebels and is accused of plundering their country's mineral resources. Since January, the armed group has been leading a major offensive in eastern DR Congo, which has put the Congolese army under considerable pressure. A Congolese offer to the US secretary of state The prospect of a minerals deal was first outlined by Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi in a February 22 interview with the New York Times. In his first interview since the launch of the 2025 M23 offensive, Tshisekedi “offered the United States and Europe a stake in his country’s vast mineral wealth, a sector currently dominated by China"", the US daily reported. The Congolese president had “pinned his hopes on Western pressure against Rwanda”, calculating that a deal could bring his country security and stability, said the report. Tshisekedi also told The New York Times that the Trump administration had “already shown interest in a deal that could ensure a stream of strategic minerals directly from Congo”. The interview was published a day after a US consultancy, commissioned by Congolese senator and Tshisekedi supporter Pierre Kanda Kalambayi, sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, offering a “strategic partnership” between the two countries. The letter proposed access to Congolese minerals, operational control of a deep-water port to serve as an export hub, and the establishment of a joint strategic mineral stockpile. In return, the US would train and equip Congolese armed forces to “protect mineral supply routes from foreign-backed militant groups”. The strengthened military cooperation could even replace MONUSCO, which the letter described as the “ineffective UN peacekeeping operations” in the central African nation. “Until we have proof to the contrary, this is not an official plan,” explained Jason K. Sterns, a leading US expert on the DR Congo. “Some points seem unrealistic, such as the deployment of American forces on the ground, which runs counter to [President] Donald Trump's promise to bring home the soldiers. But what is certain is that the Congolese army is in a weak position in the east and that the authorities are counting heavily on international pressure, particularly from the United States, to increase the pressure on Rwanda.”  Calls for transparency The possibility of a US-DR Congo agreement raises several questions. “This is symptomatic of the governance problems in our country,” said Jean Pierre Okenda, executive director of the Congolese NGO, La sentinelle des ressources naturelles. Okenda, a mining sector expert, expressed concerns that the negotiations, dictated by the DR Congo’s security emergency, may not benefit the Congolese economy. “Some people here think that the authorities are seeking above all to protect their power. Such an agreement should not be negotiated in backhanded deals, it should be submitted to parliament since it could have a major impact on the population,” he noted. Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya Katembwe claimed last week that the DR Congo was simply seeking to diversify its partners. Meanwhile a Congolese presidency spokesperson refuted the idea that the DR Congo was ready to trade its minerals for security support. “Setting the record straight: President Tshisekedi invites the USA, whose companies source strategic raw materials from Rwanda, materials that are looted from the DRC and smuggled to Rwanda while our populations are massacred, to purchase them directly from us the rightful owners,” said Tina Salama on X. When contacted by FRANCE 24, Salama asserted that Congolese Senator Kalambayi's move was a “personal initiative”. “We are seeking to stop the Rwandan predation of our resources,” she explained, holding out the hope that a strategic agreement with the US could help “stop the war”. Western hardening towards Rwanda Salama also made it clear that the initiative was specifically directed at the US “because what has been hidden and fostered for 30 years has just been revealed by Donald Trump's administration”. It was a reference to the US sanctions, announced on February 20, on James Kabarebe, Rwanda’s minister of state for regional integration, and Lawrence Kanyuka, spokesman for the M23 rebellion. “It's clear that the recent US sanctions are seen as an important step,” explained Okenda. “This is the first time a Rwandan minister has been directly targeted. What's more, this is just one stage in the sanctions that Washington could impose against Rwanda,” she noted. In its statement, the US Treasury Department described Kabarebe as “a Rwandan government liaison to M23” who has “coordinated the export of extracted minerals from mining sites in the DRC for eventual export from Rwanda”.  According to UN experts, the M23 levies substantial taxes on mining activities, generating around $800,000 a month from coltan taxation alone, in the Rubaya area of North Kivu, which it has controlled since May 2024. On February 21, the UN Security Council unanimously approved a resolution “strongly condemning” the M23 offensive in the DR Congo and the advances it is making in North and South Kivu provinces with the support of the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF). Read moreUN Security Council demands Rwanda withdraw troops from eastern DR Congo A snub to China Congolese appeals for Western mining investments are seen as a snub to China, which alone controls between 75 and 80% of mining operations in DR Congo, particularly in the copper and cobalt sectors. But this does not necessarily mean the Congolese president has made a diplomatic U-turn, according to Sterns. “Félix Tshisekedi has always had a tendency to look to the West, he has spent much of his life in Belgium and was supported by the United States during his disputed election in 2018,” he noted. Since coming to power, the Congolese president has made two bilateral visits to China, aimed at developing, but also rebalancing, the partnership with Beijing. In January 2024, he concluded the renegotiation of a major mining agreement between the DRC and a Chinese consortium dubbed “the contract of the century”. Originally signed in 2008 under then-president Joseph Kabila, the renegotiation was meant to yield additional benefits for the DRC. But it failed to appease many Congolese and was slammed by NGOs and civil society groups. “China has not respected its part of the 2008 agreement concerning its infrastructure investments. On the ground, there is no real engagement with local communities, and Chinese companies have no regard for workers' rights or respect for the environment,” said Okenda. “Today, many of these workers think, rightly or wrongly, that it would be better to deal with the US.” An American mirage? Inspired by the much-discussed, but yet to be signed Ukraine-US mining deal, the Congolese counterpart has several attractions for Washington DC. It presents a nod to Trump's “America first” agenda, while countering the interests of his rival, China. But operationally, such a project presents enormous challenges, warns Okenda. “Most of the mining concessions have already been handed over to private companies in the southeast of the country, the part richest in copper, cobalt and lithium ores. This seems to leave little room for a large-scale agreement with the US. Of course, many exploration projects are under way. But they represent huge investments, with no guarantees on arrival, which are not factored into the balance when it comes to obtaining emergency security aid,” he noted. Negotiations with Washington DC seem even more risky given that no US mining company currently operates in the DRC. The last American venture on Congolese soil left a sour taste and bad memories in the central African country. Freeport-McMoRan's departure caused a stir in 2016, when the company was accused of selling its assets to a Chinese company without consulting Congolese authorities. Nonetheless, the US retains an interest in DR Congo's mining resources. This was demonstrated by former president Joe Biden's active support for the Lobito Corridor, a rail project designed to link the mines of northern Zambia and southeastern DRC to the Angolan port of Lobito, in order to strengthen US supplies and counteract Chinese influence. “US mining companies could return to DR Congo as a result of the current discussions. But the idea that the United States could seriously compete with or even replace China is a fallacy, as it no longer possesses the industrial capacities for metal processing and refining that Beijing does,” explained Sterns.   Behind the scenes, however, Congolese and US officials are busy trying to find common ground. On Tuesday, Congolese presidential spokeswoman Salama welcomed the fact that “discussions are going well”, while explaining that she wanted to “wait until they are concluded before revealing their content”. Salama also confirmed reports that André Wameso, Tshisekedi’s deputy chief of staff, had visited Washington in early March, accompanied by a delegation. Congolese government spokesman Katembwe explained last week that “daily exchanges” were taking place with the US. For his part, Trump is reportedly preparing to appoint a special envoy to the Great Lakes region, tasked with a priority mission to study Congolese mineral deals. US reports say Massad Boulos, whose son Michael is married to Trump’s daughter Tiffany, has been picked for the job.

https://apnews.com/article/brussels-european-parliament-arrests-corruption-belgium-bribery-b02bc4aa12f312dcbd360070f3853c1b,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgian federal prosecutors on Thursday announced the arrests of several people in a corruption probe linked to the European Parliament and the Chinese company Huawei, which is suspected of bribing EU lawmakers. The arrests came as an investigation by Le Soir newspaper and other media said lobbyists working for the Chinese telecoms giant were suspected of bribing current or former European Parliament members to promote the company’s commercial policies in Europe. The prosecutor’s office confirmed in a statement that the alleged bribery “is said to have benefited Huawei.” About 100 federal police officers carried out 21 searches in Brussels, the Flanders and Wallonia regions, and Portugal. The investigating magistrate in charge of the case also asked for seals to be placed on offices inside the EU Parliament allocated to two parliamentary assistants allegedly involved. Prosecutors said one person was arrested in France. The suspects would be questioned over “alleged involvement in active corruption within the European Parliament, as well as for forgery and use of forgeries,” prosecutors said. “The offences were allegedly committed by a criminal organization.” The company said in a statement that “Huawei takes these allegations seriously and will urgently communicate with the investigation to further understand the situation.” “Huawei has a zero tolerance policy towards corruption or other wrongdoing, and we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations at all times,” it added. The European Parliament said only that the assembly “takes note of the information” and “always cooperates fully with the judicial authorities.” Huawei, which makes cellphones and is the biggest maker of networking gear for phone and internet carriers, has been caught in tensions between the United States and China over technology and trade. Some European nations have followed Washington’s lead and banned Huawei’s equipment from next-generation mobile networks over allegations that it poses a security risk that could help facilitate Chinese spying. The company has repeatedly denied this. European Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said the EU’s executive branch had no comment regarding the investigation but underlined the commission’s security concerns about Huawei and Europe’s fifth-generation mobile phone networks. “The security of our 5G networks is obviously crucial for our economy,” Regnier told reporters. “Huawei represents materially higher risks than other 5G suppliers.” EU member states should swiftly “adopt decisions to restrict or to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks,” Regnier said. “A lack of swift action would expose the EU as a whole to a clear risk.” The prosecutor’s office said it believes there was corruption “from 2021 to the present day” in various forms, “such as remuneration for taking political positions or excessive gifts such as food and travel expenses or regular invitations to football matches.” Prosecutors also believe payments might have been disguised as business expenses and in some cases may have been directed to third parties. They said they would also look to “detect any evidence of money laundering.” Police seized several documents and objects during the searches. Staff at Huawei’s offices in Brussels declined to comment and turned the lights off inside to avoid photographs taken through the window. This is the second corruption case targeting the EU Parliament in less than three years. In December 2022, the legislature was shaken by a corruption scandal in which Qatari officials were accused of bribing EU officials to play down labor rights concerns ahead of the soccer World Cup. The scandal scarred the reputation of the EU’s only institution comprised of officials elected directly in the 27 member countries. It undermined the assembly’s claim to the moral high ground in its own investigations, such as into allegations of corruption in member country Hungary. EU Greens lawmaker Daniel Freund — who supervised the work of the assembly’s ethics body during the scandal, dubbed Qatargate — said Thursday the parliament’s reputation is again under threat. “The risk of corruption in Brussels is high because the EU is so influential,” he said. “We need a complete investigation quickly, and finally reforms that will make the Parliament more resistant to corruption.” According to Follow The Money, an investigative journalism platform, one of the main suspects in the probe is 41-year-old Valerio Ottati, a Belgian-Italian lobbyist who joined Huawei in 2019. Before becoming Huawei’s EU public affairs director, Ottati was an assistant to two Italian MEPs who were both members of a European Parliament group dealing with China policy, Follow the Money reported. ___ Petrequin reported from Paris.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/witkoff-reportedly-presents-new-proposal-for-gaza-truce-extension-to-israel-hamas/,"After arriving in Doha earlier this week, US special envoy Steve Witkoff presented Israel and Hamas with a new outline to extend the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip by several weeks in exchange for Hamas releasing five living and 10 dead hostages, according to reports on Thursday. The reports on the new proposal drew concern from the families of the hostages, who said the deal, if agreed upon, would leave many of their loved ones in captivity for a “long and undetermined length of time.” Fifty-nine hostages are still held in Gaza, with 24 of them believing to be alive. The existence and details of the new US outline were first reported by Axios, which cited sources familiar with the matter. The proposal, which differs from a previous outline put forward by Witkoff, would extend the current ceasefire by several weeks, until the end of both Ramadan and Passover, in exchange for the release of additional hostages, according to the Axios report. At the same time, Israel would also be required to resume the flow of humanitarian aid into the war-torn Palestinian enclave. Hebrew media outlets reported later Thursday that the US proposal provides for five living and 10 dead hostages to be returned, and extending the ceasefire for a further 42-50 days. Citing two unnamed sources, Axios reported that the extension, should all parties agree to implement it, would give the US additional time to negotiate a more concrete, long-term truce agreement. Should a long-term ceasefire agreement be reached, the report said that Hamas would be required to hand over all remaining hostages, living and dead, on the last day of the temporary truce extension, before the concrete ceasefire came into effect. Israel gave “a positive response” to Witkoff’s latest proposal, the Axios report said, while Qatar and Egypt were still awaiting Hamas’s response after delivering the details of the outline to the terror group on Wednesday night. According to a Channel 12 report late Thursday, Israel has demanded that a larger number of living hostages be freed. Hamas, for its part, has demanded that the US guarantee that there will be discussions on phase two of the current deal, which provides for the full withdrawal of the IDF and the end of the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to hold negotiations on the second phase despite the agreement’s stipulations. Netanyahu will reportedly convene top aides and security chiefs on Saturday night for a “situational assessment” on the latest developments of the hostage talks in Doha, and if no breakthrough is achieved by then, the premier will bring his negotiating team home. If the sides cannot reach an agreement based on the new Witkoff proposal, the Channel 12 report said that mediators were expected to push Israel and Hamas toward a smaller interim arrangement, under which a “solitary few” living hostages would be freed and the ceasefire maintained. The purpose of the smaller arrangement would be to buy more time for negotiations and avoid the complete collapse of the talks and a return to fighting. In the course of the extended ceasefire, discussions would take place on “final summations” — an apparent reference to the end of the war. “If there is no progress in the next 48 hours, the Israeli delegation will return to Israel,” Channel 12 quoted a senior Israeli source as saying. The network also said that Israel’s demand for Hamas leaders to go into exile is “off the agenda” given the “stubborn opposition” from Hamas’s leaders in Gaza, quoting sources in Israel’s negotiating team as saying the demand was not going to be raised as an option in the ongoing talks. However, Netanyahu’s office firmly denied that claim, calling it “fake news,” saying Israel still wants Hamas’s Gaza leaders sent into exile while confirming that the prime minister is open to extending safe passage abroad for them. “Fake news once again,” the Prime Minister’s Office said. “In contrast to the false report from Channel 12 this evening, the exile of senior Hamas officials has not been taken off the agenda.” Following the flurry of reports, the families of the Gaza hostages expressed “serious concerns” about Witkoff’s proposal, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. “The reports about the outline for the return of just a few hostages raise serious concerns among the families of the hostages that their loved ones will be left in captivity for a long and undetermined length of time,” the forum said. The forum demanded a “comprehensive and immediate agreement that will return all 59 hostages in one fell swoop and leave nobody behind.” “Otherwise, the living hostages who remain in the tunnels will be sentenced to death, and we will not be able to locate and return the dead for burial,” it added. MK Benny Gantz, who heads the opposition National Unity party, expressed similar concerns, saying that Netanyahu was either making “concessions” to Hamas or “stalling.” “In the first hostage outline, we returned 10 living hostages per day; in the current outline, four per week, and now we are discussing a plan to return five live hostages per month,” he said. “The conclusion is simple — either Netanyahu is making concessions, or Netanyahu is stalling,” Gantz wrote, adding that “Israel’s interest is to return all the hostages as quickly as possible.” “What is happening now is that Netanyahu is allowing Hamas to rehabilitate instead of dismantling it, endangering the hostages instead of returning them, and preserving his coalition instead of national interests,” he concluded. Hamas has so far released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire that began in January. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. Eight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014. The body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas and is counted among the 59 hostages.","Witkoff reportedly presents new proposal for Gaza truce extension to Israel, Hamas",ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-03-13T21:28:13,2025-03-13T21:28:13,gemini-2.0-flash

— Greenland’s likely new prime minister on Wednesday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to take control of the island, saying Greenlanders must be allowed to decide their own future as it moves toward independence from Denmark. Jens-Frederik Nielsen’s Demokraatit, a pro-business party that favors a slow path to independence, won a surprise victory in Tuesday’s parliamentary election, outpacing the two left-leaning parties that formed the last government. With most Greenlanders opposing Trump’s overtures, the campaign focused more on issues like healthcare and education than on geopolitics. But on Wednesday Nielsen was quick to push back against Trump, who last week told a joint session of Congress that the U.S. needed Greenland to protect its own national security interests and he expected to get it “one way or the other.” “We don’t want to be Americans. No, we don’t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders, and we want our own independence in the future,” Nielsen, 33, told Britain’s Sky News. “And we want to build our own country by ourselves.” That didn’t stop Trump from suggesting during a Thursday Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte that Greenland’s election that it was “very good” for “us” and “the person who did the best is a very good person, as far as we’re concerned.” Greenland, a self-governing region of Denmark, has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009, when the government in Copenhagen recognized its right to self-determination under international law. Four of the five main parties in the election supported independence, though they disagreed on when and how to achieve it. The island of 56,000 people, most from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds, has attracted international attention since Trump announced his designs on it soon after returning to the White House in January. Trump is focused on Greenland because it straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and is home to the U.S.’s Pituffik Space Base, which supports missile warning and space surveillance operations. Greenland also has large deposits of the rare-earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology. Trump said during the meeting with Rutte that “Denmark’s very far away” from Greenland and questioned whether that country still had a right to claim the world’s largest island as part of its kingdom. “A boat landed there 200 years ago or something. And they say they have rights to it,” Trump said. “I don’t know if that’s true. I don’t think it is, actually.” Trump said U.S. control of Greenland could be important for national security reasons and even suggested NATO should be involved, but Rutte demurred. Trump nonetheless noted that the U.S. already has a considerable military presence in Greenland and added, “Maybe you’ll see more and more soldiers going there. I don’t know.” Despite that, Trump’s overtures weren’t on the ballot. The 31 men and women elected to parliament on Tuesday will have to set priorities for issues such as diversifying Greenland’s economy, building infrastructure and improving health care, as well as shaping the country’s strategy for countering the president’s America First agenda. Demokraatit won 29.9% of the vote by campaigning to improve housing and educational standards while delaying independence until Greenland is self-sufficient. Four years ago, the party finished in fourth place with 9.1%. Nuuk resident Anthon Nielsen said the party’s victory would be good for the country. “Most politicians want Greenland to be independent,” he said. “But this party who won, they don’t want to hurry things so everything must be done right.” Carina Ren, head of the Arctic program at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, said the results show that Greenlanders tried to ignore Trump and focus on issues that were important to them. “The voters have been able to drag down all the drama, all the alarmist talk from the outside to say, ‘Well, this is about our everyday lives, our everyday concerns as citizens. Where are we going, how are we going to develop our society from the inside.’” Now Demokraatit will have to turn its attention to forming a governing coalition. Naleraq, the most aggressively pro-independence party, finished in second place, with 24.5% of the vote. It was followed by Inuit Ataqatigiit, which led the last government, at 21.4%. “What approach to independence will win the day will ultimately depend on if Demokraatit decides to form a coalition government, and if so, with which party,” said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative. Nielsen appeared to be surprised by Demokraatit’s gains as the results came it, with photos showing him sporting a huge grin and applauding at a post-election party. He later said Demokraatit would reach out to all the other parties to negotiate Greenland’s future political course. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen congratulated Demokraatit and warned that Greenland’s new government would likely have to “deal with massive pressure” from Trump. “It’s not the case that you can just take part of the Danish Realm,” Danish broadcaster DR quoted him as saying. “The future of Greenland is based on what the Greenlandic people and government want.” Greenland Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede last month called early elections, saying the country needed to be united during a “serious time” unlike anything Greenland has ever experienced. On Wednesday, after the results were known, Egede used a Facebook post to thank voters for turning out and said the parties were ready to turn to negotiations to form a government. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Washington.", Greenland elections: Center-right Demokraatit Party wins most votes,Danica Kirka,AP News,2025-03-12T05:36:07,2025-03-13T14:45:38,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/13/trumps-steel-aluminium-tariffs-how-are-targeted-countries-responding?traffic_source=rss,"Some countries are fighting back with retaliatory tariffs, others are seeking exemptions and are trying to negotiate. President Donald Trumpâ	ms tariffs on the imports of steel and aluminium by the United States are sending shockwaves through global markets and escalating tensions with key trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Some countries are fighting back with retaliatory tariffs, others are seeking exemptions, and a few are trying to negotiate their way out of the 25 percent tariffs. So, who is escalating the trade war, who is trying to avoid it, and what does this mean for the industries that rely on these metals? Canada, Brazil, and Mexico are the top three suppliers of steel to the US, collectively accounting for about 49 percent of its imports between March 2024 and January 2025, according to the International Trade Administration. The remaining leading suppliers are South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Germany, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and China, which together make up 30 percent of US steel imports. Here is a breakdown: For aluminium, the biggest suppliers are Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Mexico. Canada is the dominant supplier, responsible for nearly 40 percent of US aluminium imports, followed by the UAE, Russia and Mexico. The tariff war will have a widespread effect on manufacturers and consumers in the US as steel and aluminium are crucial in the making of home appliances, cars, planes, phones and buildings, among others. Steel is a backbone material for construction, manufacturing, transport, and energy, with the construction sector using one-third of all steel imports. It will push up costs for infrastructure projects, including airports, schools and roads. Aluminium, being lightweight and corrosion-resistant, is essential for the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as food and beverage packaging. The US is particularly dependent on aluminium imports, with roughly half of the metal used in the country coming from foreign sources. The US import of steel and aluminium last year was $31bn and $27bn, respectively, according to the US Department of Commerce data. Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, said the tariffs are especially damaging because there is â	clittle economic or genuine national security rationale for themâ	. â	The US canâ	 realistically onshore enough of these commodities, so the duties mainly create economic pain for American consumers and key trading partners,â	 Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera. They instead introduce a level of â	unpredictability and volatility we havenâ	 seen in decadesâ	. By undermining established trade norms, the US â	effectively encourages other nations to respond in kind, with devastating impact for the stock markets and investor and consumer confidence across North America and beyondâ	, Nadjibulla said. The biggest steel and aluminium supplier to the US has taken a strong stance against the tariffs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the tariffs â	unjustifiableâ	 and a â	cdumb thing to doâ	. Canada announced 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on $20.6bn worth of US goods, including $8.8bn on steel and $2bn in aluminium imports. It has also imposed an additional tariff of nearly $10bn on US goods such as computers and servers, display monitors, water heaters and sports equipment, among others. These countermeasures take effect on Thursday. â	We are going to stand up for our workers, and we are going to make sure the American people understand that their leadershipâ	ms decisions have consequences,â	 Trudeau said earlier this week. Mark Carney, who will succeed Trudeau as prime minister, has pledged to maintain the tariffs until the US commits to fair trade practices. He said he is willing to take â	ca much more comprehensive approach for tradeâ	. â	We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,â	 he said on Wednesday. The latest tariffs are in addition to the 25 percent counter-tariffs on $20.8bn of US imports, imposed on March 4 in retaliation to the previous Trump levy that has since been delayed by a month. The EU has also announced retaliatory measures targeting more than $28bn worth of US goods such as motorcycles, peanut butter, and jeans, among others. These measures will roll out in two phases: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned that these tariffs will increase prices and threaten jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. â	We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and even worse for consumers,â	 she said, adding that the EU â	will always remain open to negotiationâ	. Mexicoâ	ms response remains unclear. President Claudia Sheinbaum has indicated that any retaliatory tariffs would be implemented only if negotiations fail. However, she has already struck a temporary waiver deal with Trump, securing an exemption until April 2 for Mexican imports under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade agreement signed under Trumpâ	ms first term. However, analysts say goods that do not comply with the USMCA could still attract the new 25 percent tariffs. This comes after Mexico and Canada negotiated a one-month delay in the tariffs, during which both countries agreed to boost border security measures. Trump has followed through with his campaign promise to impose tariffs on Mexico until it stopped immigration and drug trafficking through its borders. Despite being one of the hardest-hit nations, Brazil has chosen diplomacy over retaliation. Brazilian officials are engaging in talks with Washington in hopes of securing an exemption. The government led by left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued a statement regretting the â	unjustifiableâ	 move by the US. â	President Lula told us to remain calm, noting that in the past we have negotiated under conditions that were even more unfavourable than the current ones,â	 Finance Minister Fernando Haddad told reporters on Wednesday. Trump has accused South Korea of taking advantage of the US, adding that Seoulâ	ms average tariff is four times higher, without providing proof. The trade between the two close allies is almost tariff-free due to a free trade agreement. â	And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea. But thatâ	ms what happens,â	 Trump said during his address to the US Congress earlier this month. He also promised to scrap the CHIPS and Science Act, under which several Korean companies, including Samsung Electronics, receive US assistance. South Korea has opted for negotiation rather than confrontation. It has also activated a â	full emergency response modeâ	 to protect local industries. On Tuesday, South Koreaâ	ms acting President Choi Sang-mok said Trumpâ	ms â	America Firstâ	 policy had started targeting his country. South Korean officials have actively sought dialogue with their US counterparts to negotiate potential exemptions and address mutual concerns. Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo is scheduled to visit Washington, DC, on March 13-14, aiming to discuss reciprocal tariffs and investment opportunities. The visit seeks to influence the Trump administrationâ	ms trade policy report and to present South Koreaâ	ms stance on tariffs. Beijing is not a leading steel supplier to the US. However, it has taken the tariffs as a direct economic attack and responded aggressively. Mao Ning, spokesperson at the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters the move was in violation of World Trade Organization rules, and that China, the worldâ	ms largest steel producer and the second-largest economy, will take all necessary measures to safeguard its rights and interests. â	No one wins in a trade war or a tariff war,â	 the spokesperson said. China has already slapped tariffs on the US in retaliation to the 20 percent blanket tariff imposed by Trump. Australia, another key US ally which has been affected by Trumpâ	ms tariffs, said it would not retaliate. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the tariff â	centirely unjustifiedâ	, but ruled out reciprocal tariffs as it would affect Australian consumers. Canberra had managed to get an exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs under Trumpâ	ms first term. According to Nadjibulla, these tariffs paint an image that the US is becoming â	can unreliable partner for its closest alliesâ	. She said countries such as Canada, Australia, and South Korea â	will look to minimise their vulnerabilitiesâ	 and pursue strategies like diversifying trade partners. â	When large economies engage in tit-for-tat tariff escalations, the risk of a global trade slowdown looms larger,â	 she said. â	These measures donâ	 just hurt the near-term bottom line â	 they threaten the entire framework of open trade that has underpinned much of the worldâ	ms economic growth and stability.â	 Follow Al Jazeera English:","Trump’s steel, aluminium tariffs: How are targeted countries responding?",Al Jazeera,Al Jazeera,2025-03-13T10:16:44Z,2025-03-13T19:27:30Z,gemini-2.0-flash

The Russia-Ukraine war is on the agenda Thursday as foreign ministers from the G7 group of leading industrial nations meet in Canada amid a push to secure a ceasefire in the conflict. The talks in Quebec follow U.S.-Ukraine talks that included a U.S. proposal for ""an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire,"" which Ukrainian leaders said they were ready to accept. ""We must move toward peace. We must move toward security guarantees,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during his nightly address Wednesday. ""The key factor is our partners’ ability to ensure Russia’s readiness not to deceive but to genuinely end the war."" The Kremlin has said it was waiting to hear about the ceasefire proposal from U.S. officials. The White House said Wednesday that national security adviser Steve Witkoff was heading to Moscow for talks in the coming days. The G7 talks bring together ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly, who is hosting the meetings, said Canada welcomes the U.S. proposal to halt the fighting in Ukraine and that a ceasefire is ""the first step toward a just and lasting peace."" ""The ball is now in Russia’s court to show that it is likewise ready for a ceasefire and to put an end to the bloodshed. The world is watching,"" Joly said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters en route to Canada on Wednesday that the U.S. will have ""multiple points of contact"" with Russia to assess its willingness for the peace deal. ""Now, we all eagerly await the Russian response, and urge them strongly to consider ending all hostilities … so a process can begin to find a permanent peace,"" Rubio told VOA on Wednesday. Rubio added there is a need for monitors if Russia agrees to a ceasefire. ""If they [Russians] say yes, one of the things we'll have to determine is who do both sides trust to be on the ground to sort of monitor some of the small arms fire and exchanges that could happen,"" Rubio told reporters. At the White House on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said it was ""up to Russia now"" to respond. ""And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia,"" he said. ""And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished."" Trump is hosting NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for talks Thursday at the White House.

His comments come amid NATO's warnings that Russia may be ramping up hybrid operations in the region. Several undersea cables were damaged in recent months, leading the alliance to increase its presence in the Baltic Sea. Speaking to National Defense, a Russian military and political magazine, Patrushev alleged that NATO's naval forces are working to ""block""Russia in the Baltic while ignoring diplomatic engagement withMoscow. Patrushev further accused thealliance, particularly the U.K., of provoking instability in the region. ""The forecast of the situation in the Baltic allows us to draw attention to the deliberate fomentation of regional tensions by the naval forces ofEuropeancountries of the alliance,"" he said. Patrushev also claimed, without evidence, that NATO is conducting cyberattacks onRussian ships' navigation systems to create maritime emergencies, including accidents and infrastructure failures.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-845901,"Israel has transferred some 10,000 packages of humanitarian aid to Syrian Druze in recent weeks, the Foreign Ministry announced on Thursday. The ministry noted that the transfer was carried out in conjunction with Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze in Israel. Most of the packages were transported to As-Suwayda, while others were delivered to Druze communities near the border with Israel. The packages include basic food supplies, such as salt, oil, flour, and rice. ""We have a bold alliance with our Druze brothers. It is a privilege to help them,"" Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar noted. In a region in which we will always be a minority, it is both necessary and the right thing to do to assist other minorities,"" he added. The move comes as Israel has been in contact with Syrian Druze leaders, promising to protect them from harm following the toppling of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad by Â
Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the subsequent ascension to power of Ahmed al-Sharaa. On March 1,Defense Minister Israel Katzand Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement saying, ""We will not allow the terrorist regime of radical Islam in Syria to harm the Druze."" ""If the regime harms the Druze, it will be harmed by us. We are committed to our Druze brothers in Israel to do everything to prevent harm to their Druze brothers in Syria, and we will take all necessary steps to maintain their security.""

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250313002400320,"SEOUL, March 13 (Yonhap) -- Acting President Choi Sang-mok on Thursday directed officials to take measures to prevent any possible disruption in the domestic market caused by a sudden rise in steel products that have failed to be shipped to the United States due to increased tariffs. The U.S.' sweeping 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all countries took effect as President Donald Trump pushed for increased levies on the metals to bolster domestic manufacturing. During a meeting with ministers and officials, Choi emphasized the need to prioritize negotiations with Washington while ensuring that the sudden surplus of steel does not flood the domestic market. Given the significant potential impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) dealing with steel and aluminum-related products, Choi directed authorities to provide tailored support measures. Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals while also raising aluminum tariffs from 10 percent. His latest move, based on a directive issued in February, is expected to disrupt and reshape the global trade landscape. khj@yna.co.kr(END)",Acting president orders measures to prevent market disruption from 'unexported' steel,Kim Han-joo,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-13T09:36:56,2025-03-13T09:36:56,gemini-2.0-flash

Last Thursday, two KF-16 fighter jets dropped eight MK-82 bombs outside a training range in Pocheon, some 40 kilometers north of Seoul, during live-fire drills, injuring 38 people, including 24 civilians. ""The Criminal Investigation Command has confirmed in the probe to date that the pilots' erroneous entry of target coordinates was the direct cause of the accident,"" the defense ministry said in a notice to reporters.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) The pilots, booked as of Thursday, have been charged with professional negligence resulting in injury, according to the ministry. In an interim probe released Monday, the Air Force pointed to pilot error for the accidental bombing, saying the pilots had at least three opportunities to catch their mistake after entering the wrong target coordinates prior to takeoff.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y02jexjxxo,"Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected the idea of negotiations with the US over its nuclear programme, as Tehran confirmed receiving a letter from President Donald Trump. Last week, Trump said the letter proposed talks on a deal that would prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons and avert possible military action. Although Khamenei said he had not seen the letter, which was delivered by an official from the United Arab Emirates, he dismissed it as a ""deception of public opinion"". ""When we know they won't honour it, what's the point of negotiating?"" he asked, referring to Trump's decision to abandon the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal during his first term. He warned that Iran would retaliate in the event of strikes on its nuclear facilities. ""Iran is not seeking war, but if the Americans or their agents take a wrong step, our response will be decisive and certain, and the one who will suffer the most harm is America,"" he said. The supreme leader, who has the final say on all state matters, also reiterated that Iran was ""not interested in nuclear weapons"". Ten years ago, the country agreed a historic deal with six world powers - China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US - to limit its nuclear activities and allow monitoring by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in return for sanctions relief. However, Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the accord in 2018 and reinstated crippling US economic sanctions. He labelled it ""the worst deal in history"", saying it did too little to stop Iran's potential pathway to building a nuclear bomb. Iran responded by increasingly breaching the terms of the deal, particularly those limiting the production of enriched uranium, which can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants but also to build nuclear weapons. The IAEA said last month that Iran had stockpiled almost 275kg (606lb) of uranium enriched to 60% purity, which is near weapons grade. That would theoretically be enough, if enriched to 90%, for six nuclear bombs. Both the US and Israel have warned that they will never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Israel has threatened to strike Iranian nuclear facilities if necessary. Last year, Israel said it hit part of Iran's nuclear programme during strikes that it carried out in response to an Iranian missile attack. In a TV interview broadcast last Friday, Trump said: ""There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because I'm not looking to hurt Iran. They're great people."" ""I have written them a letter saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate,' because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for them,"" he added. The White House has not given any details about the contents of the letter, which Iran said was handed to Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi by UAE presidential adviser Anwar Gargash. Although the supreme leader dismissed the idea of negotiations with the US, Iran's mission to the UN did say in a statement on Sunday that it might consider talks ""if the objective is... to address concerns vis-Ã	-vis any potential militarisation of Iran's nuclear programme"". Araqchi also said on Wednesday that nuclear talks with the UK, France and Germany were ""ongoing"", while the Chinese foreign ministry said China, Russia and Iran would discuss the ""Iranian nuclear issue"" at a trilateral meeting in Beijing on Friday.",Iran rejects nuclear talks as UAE delivers Trump's letter,David Gritten,BBC News,2025-03-12T16:58:48,2025-03-12T16:58:48,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/un-reform-initiative-funding-challenges-guterres-trump-6c8318f9a129064ec69a179244ce4a3e,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. chief launched a new initiative Wednesday to reform the United Nations as it approaches its 80th anniversary, saying the 193-member global organization needs an urgent update to deal with major funding reductions and still tackle the world’s challenges. Secretary-General António Guterres dismissed any relationship between his UN80 Initiative and cuts to foreign aid and other programs that U.S. President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk say will make the U.S. government more efficient. “We are talking about completely different processes, methodologies and objectives,” Guterres told reporters. “This is a continuation and an intensification of work that we have always been doing.” He said the U.N. initiative’s objective will be to present member states with proposals for improving the way the organization works, reviewing the increasing number of mandates from the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly, and making structural changes to streamline operations. One key problem is that while the secretary-general is the U.N.’s chief executive, power rests with the 193 member nations that have very different ideas about the U.N. and the world. The United Nations also has faced sharp criticism for its failure to preserve international peace and security — its key mission — with critics pointing to the wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and Congo, to name a few. The U.N. has been key to providing humanitarian aid to millions of people and for its work helping refugees and children. Trump signed an executive order saying some U.N. agencies and bodies have drifted from their mission to promote peace and prevent future global conflicts and ordered a review of their operations. “I’ve always felt that the U.N. has tremendous potential,” Trump has said. “It’s not living up to that potential right now. ... They’ve got to get their act together.” Stressing that the United Nations reflects the world, Guterres said these are times of intense uncertainty and unpredictability. He said the U.N.’s work is affected by multiplying conflicts, inadequate progress in reducing poverty, widespread flouting of international law, violations of human rights and the lack of guardrails for new technologies, including artificial intelligence — to name a few. “And all of them are aggravated by major reductions of funding for humanitarian aid and development cooperation,” the secretary-general said. “In many cases, these obstacles are fueling dangerous levels of geopolitical tensions and divisions.” Guterres didn’t name any countries, but the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was in charge of humanitarian aid, and cut 83% of USAID’s programs. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, also are reducing humanitarian aid. He said the U.N.’s resources have been shrinking, pointing to its liquidity crisis for at least the past seven years because not all member states pay their yearly dues, and many don’t pay on time. Guterres said the UN80 Initiative is not only about reforming the U.N. but about “better serving people whose very lives depend on us” and “taxpayers around the world who underwrite everything we do.” The initiative will cover not only the U.N. Secretariat but all its funds and agencies and offices in Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna. It will be led by U.N. Undersecretary-General for Policy Guy Ryder, who will head a task force of top officials from the U.N. system, Guterres said. The U.N. budget for 2025, which was adopted last December, is $3.72 billion. The U.S., with the world’s biggest economy, is expected to pay 22%. China, with the second-largest economy, just had its share raised to 20%. Guterres said he hopes to move as soon as possible to take action in areas where he has authority and will urge member states “to consider the many decisions that rest with them.”",UN launches reform initiative as it nears its 80th anniversary and faces funding cuts,Edith M.

https://apnews.com/article/trump-eu-tariffs-countermeasures-806a3b9bcc9cd4e45817e672d95f0070,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Major trade partners swiftly hit back at President Donald Trump’s increased tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, imposing stiff new taxes on U.S products from textiles and water heaters to beef and bourbon. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminum to the U.S., said Wednesday it will place 25% reciprocal tariffs on steel products and also raise taxes on a host of items: tools, computers and servers, display monitors, sports equipment, and cast-iron products. Steel on coil cars ahead of transport at the main factory of struggling steel producer thyssenkrupp in Duisburg, Germany, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025. (AP Photo Meissner, File) Across the Atlantic, the European Union will raise tariffs on American beef, poultry, bourbon and motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans. Combined, the new tariffs will cost companies billions of dollars, and further escalate the uncertainty in two of the world’s major trade partnerships. Companies will either take the losses and earn fewer profits, or, more likely, pass costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices. Prices will go up, in Europe and the United States, and jobs are at stake, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers,” von der Leyen said. President Donald Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising that the taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown. The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. EU officials have made clear that the tariffs — taxes on imports — are aimed at products made in Republican-held states, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska and wood products from Alabama and Georgia. The tariffs will also hit blue states such as Illinois, the No. 1 U.S. producer of soybeans, which are also on the list. Spirits producers have becomecollateral damagein the dispute over steel and aluminum. The EU move “is deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild U.S. spirits exports in EU countries,” said Chris Swonger, head of the Distilled Spirits Council. The EU is a major destination for U.S. whiskey, with exports surging 60% in the past three years after an earlier set of tariffs was suspended. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the world’s biggest trading bloc, the EU, was expecting U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Von der Leyen said in a statement that the EU “will always remain open to negotiation.” Canada’s incomingPrime Minister Mark Carneysaid Wednesday he’s ready to meet with Trump if he shows “respect for Canadian sovereignty″ and is willing to take ”a common approach, a much more comprehensive approach for trade.″ Carney, who will be sworn in Friday, said workers in both countries will be better off when “the greatest economic and security partnership in the world is renewed, relaunched. That is possible.” “We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,” she said. The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures “will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.” “The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,” the chamber said Wednesday. Bourbon barrels with product in them are seen inside of the Brough Brothers Distillery in Louisville, Ky., Saturday, March 8, 2025. (AP Photo Cherry) Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. TheEU also imposed countermeasuresin retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items. This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First on April 1, the commission will reimpose taxes that were in effect from 2018 and 2020, but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc. EU Trade CommissionerMaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄtraveled to Washington last month in an effort to head off the tariffs, meeting with U.S. Commerce SecretaryHoward Lutnickand other top trade officials. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick speaks with reporters after President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (AP Photo Curtis) He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip “that the EU is not the problem.” “I argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,” Å efÄoviÄ told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Canada is imposing, as of 12:01 a.m. Thursday 25% reciprocal tariffs on steel products worth $12.6 billion Canadian (US$8.7 billion) and aluminum products worth $3 billion Canadian (US$2 billion) as well as additional imported U.S. goods worth $14.2 billion Canadian ($9.9 billion) for a total of $29.8 billion (US$20.6 billion.) The list of additional products affected by counter-tariffs includes tools, computers and servers, display monitors, water heaters, sport equipment, and cast-iron products. These tariffs are in addition to Canada’s 25% counter tariffs on $30 billion Canadian (US$20.8 billion) of imports from the U.S. that were put in place on March 4 in response to other Trump tariffs that he’s delayed by a month. The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports. The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services. ___ McHugh reported from Frankfurt and Gillies from Toronto.

https://apnews.com/article/kuwait-detainees-released-trump-united-states-f71e0c3fb7690926ac5c3678346fb54f,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Kuwait has released 10 American prisoners, including veterans and military contractors jailed for years on drug-related charges, in a move seen as a gesture of goodwill between two allies. “President Trump has made it a priority to bring home Americans detained overseas. We are pleased that Kuwait has released Americans from prison,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement Thursday that said the detained Americans had been pardoned by the country’s ruling emir in recognition of Kuwait’s National Day. “Kuwait is a vital ally in the region, and we look forward to continuing to work with Kuwait and other partners in these efforts across the world,” the spokesperson added. The statement confirms earlier Associated Press reporting about the releases that cited a representative for some of the 10 who were freed. The release follows a recent visit to the region by Adam Boehler, the Trump administration’s top hostage envoy, and comes amid a continued U.S. government push to bring home American citizens jailed in foreign countries. Six of the newly freed prisoners were accompanied Wednesday on a flight from Kuwait to New York by Jonathan Franks, a private consultant who works on cases involving American hostages and detainees and who had been in the country to help secure their release.

“My clients and their families are grateful to the Kuwaiti government for this kind humanitarian gesture,” Franks said in a statement. He said that his clients maintain their innocence and that additional Americans he represents also are expected to be released by Kuwait later. The names of the released prisoners were not immediately made public. Kuwait did not acknowledge the release on its state-run KUNA news agency and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and its upcoming Eid al-Fitr holiday typically see prisoner releases across Muslim-majority nations. Kuwait, a small, oil-rich nation that borders Iraq and Saudi Arabia and is near Iran, is considered a major non-NATO ally of the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio paid tribute to that relationship as recently as last month, when he said the U.S. “remains steadfast in its support for Kuwait’s sovereignty and the well-being of its people.”The countries have had a close military partnership since America launched the 1991 Gulf War to expel Iraqi troops after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded the country, with some 13,500 American troops stationed in Kuwait at Camp Arifjan and Ali al-Salem Air Base. But Kuwait has also detained many American military contractors on drug charges, in some cases, for years. Their families have alleged that their loved ones faced abuse while imprisoned in a country that bans alcohol and has strict laws regarding drugs. Others have criticized Kuwaiti police for bringing trumped-up charges and manufacturing evidence used against them — allegations never acknowledged by the autocratic nation ruled by a hereditary emir. The State Department warns travelers that drug charges in Kuwait can carry long prison sentences and the death penalty. Defense cooperation agreements between the U.S. and Kuwait likely include provisions that ensure U.S. troops are subject only to American laws, though that likely doesn’t include contractors.Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, his Republican administration has secured the release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel in a prisoner swap with Russia and has announced the release by Belarus of an imprisoned U.S. citizen.The Americans released Wednesday had not been designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained. The status is applied to a subsection of Americans jailed abroad and historically ensures the case is handled by the administration’s special presidential envoy for hostage affairs — the office that handles negotiations for a release. But advocates of those held in foreign countries are hopeful the Trump administration takes a more flexible approach and secures the release of those not deemed wrongfully detained.“The sad reality is that these Americans were left in prison for years due to a misguided policy that had, before President Trump took office, effectively abandoned Americans abroad who hadn’t been designated wrongfully detained,” Franks said in a statement.“These releases,” he added, “demonstrate what is achievable when the U.S. government prioritizes bringing Americans home.”___Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.",Kuwait frees jailed Americans held on drug charges,"ERIC TUCKER, JON GAMBRELL",AP News,2025-03-12T21:17:36,2025-03-13T17:40:02,gemini-2.0-flash

https://abc7.com/post/3-suspected-fentanyl-traffickers-arrested-charged-55-million-drug-bust-downey/16008095/,"DOWNEY, Calif. (CNS) --Authorities announced the arrests of three suspected fentanyl traffickers and the seizure of 14 million lethal doses of the drug with an estimated street value of about $55 million, along with heroin and methamphetamine. ""To say that this investigation has saved thousands of lives is an understatement,"" Downey Police Chief Scott Lougher said at a news conference in downtown Los Angeles Tuesday, where he was joined by State Attorney General Rob Bonta and Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman. Priscilla Gomez, 43, of Torrance; her brother, Gustavo Omar Gomez, 47, of Huntington Park; and Carlos Manuel Mariscal, 38, of Huntington Park, are facing felony counts in connection with the investigation, according to Hochman. Bonta said investigators had ""reliable information"" that led them to Priscilla Gomez, whom he described as a ""courier"" who was stopped by Downey police in a traffic stop. ""She acknowledged the possession of some drugs and also a K-9 was activated at the stop,"" the attorney general said. Investigators subsequently served a search warrant at an apartment in Downey, Hochman said. Downey police found more than 50 pounds of fentanyl and nearly 12 pounds of opium in a car and in the apartment Jan. 22, according to the District Attorney's Office. The attorney general said investigators also saw ""indicia of a Mexican cartel."" ""Some cartels are known for certain decor symbols, insignias. They were present,"" Bonta said. The district attorney noted that the 50-pound seizure of fentanyl in one afternoon exceeded the total amount seized at the U.S.-Canada border in an entire year by seven pounds. ""This one seizure could have killed literally every resident in L.A. County by itself,"" Hochman said. Priscilla Gomez -- who is currently in federal custody -- is charged with three counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance and one count sale to sell controlled substance. Her brother is charged with two counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance, while Mariscal is charged with two counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance and one count each of possession of a silencer and unlawful possession of ammunition prohibited by a prior conviction, Hochman said.

https://www.riotimesonline.com/von-der-leyen-pushes-eu-defense-spending-above-3-as-time-of-illusions-ends/,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urged member states Tuesday to increase defense spending beyond 3% of GDP during a European Parliament debate in Strasbourg. “Today we spend just short of 2% of our GDP on defense. Every analysis agrees that we need to move north of 3%,” declared von der Leyen. She reminded lawmakers how Europe reduced defense spending from an average of 3.5% to less than half after the Cold War. The Commission President emphasized the EU budget alone cannot solve the challenge. “The EU budget only reaches 1% of GDP. The bulk of new investments must come from member states,” she stated. Her ambitious “ReArm Europe” plan aims to mobilize €800 billion over four years for defense. Member states would contribute approximately €650 billion through increased national spending. The Commission proposes €150 billion in loans specifically for defense investments. The plan activates the “national escape clause” of the Stability and Growth Pact. This allows countries to exceed the 3% deficit threshold without penalties when spending on defense. Member states could raise defense expenditure by 1.5% of GDP on average. Von der Leyen Pushes EU Defense Spending Above 3% as “Time of Illusions” Ends. (Photo Internet reproduction) Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine drives this dramatic shift in security policy. “Putin has proven time and again he is a hostile neighbor. He cannot be trusted, he can only be deterred,” von der Leyen remarked. Europe Ramps Up Defense Spending Current defense spending varies dramatically across Europe. Poland dedicates 4.12% of GDP to defense while Spain spends just 1.12%. Von der Leyen warned Russia’s military production now outpaces Europe’s. Other European leaders support the initiative. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen emphasized, “The most important thing now is to rearm Europe, and we don’t have much time.” Poland’s Donald Tusk called the €150 billion proposal “a massive step, but not enough.” He believes raising national defense spending to 3% will become “inevitable.” The Commission recommends investing in air and missile defense, artillery systems, ammunition, drones, and cyber capabilities. Von der Leyen stressed contracts should prioritize European producers to strengthen the domestic defense industry. Germany plans to suspend its national debt limit to invest heavily in defense. Chancellor Olaf Scholz supports additional budgetary flexibility for states to strengthen military capabilities.",Von der Leyen Pushes EU Defense Spending Above 3% as “Time of Illusions” Ends,Lachlan Williams,The Rio Times,2025-03-11T19:19:28,2025-03-11T19:21:56,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-seeks-postponement-as-trumps-25-steel-tariffs-take-effect/,"The Brazilian government has formally requested the United States to delay implementing the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports. The tariff took effect on March 12, 2025. Brazilian Vice President Geraldo Alckmin made this request during a video conference with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week. Brazil exported 4.3 million metric tons of steel to the US last year, representing nearly 48% of its total steel exports. The South American nation argues that its steel shipments do not harm US industry but serve as essential raw materials for American manufacturers. Lutnick reportedly told Alckmin he would relay the postponement request to President Trump. The Brazilian government seeks at least a one-month delay to continue negotiations and avoid damage to its export sector. President Trump’s proclamations, issued on February 10, ended all country exemptions and raised aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%. The tariffs also expanded to include downstream products like nuts, bolts, containers, and household items. The European Union swiftly announced retaliatory measures. It imposed tariffs on approximately $28 billion worth of American goods. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated these countermeasures would be implemented in two phases, completing by April 13. Trump initially threatened to impose 50% tariffs on Canadian steel but backed down after Ontario suspended electricity surcharges to three US states. This concession led to scheduled discussions between Canadian officials and US Commerce Secretary Lutnick. The reinstated tariffs terminate previous arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. All steel and aluminum imports now face the same 25% duty. Economic analysts warn these tariffs will increase production costs for US manufacturers of automobiles, home appliances, solar panels, and construction materials. This price increase could potentially slow the American economy and trigger inflation. Brazilian officials continue technical bilateral meetings with US counterparts this week. Washington has not yet officially responded to Brazil’s postponement request, leaving Brazilian exporters in uncertainty. Copyright Â© 2025 The Rio Times All Right Reserved Forgot your password?

https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-lawmakers-object-to-eus-multibillion-defense-proposal/a-71897342,"The Netherlands' parliament on Tuesday narrowly voted against a multibillion-euro European Union defense plan presented by Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof last week. The motion was introduced by the right-wing populist JA21 party, also known as the Conservative Liberals. It was supported by three of the four coalition parties. The motion passed in a 73-71 vote, with the opposition Socialists (SP) also voting in favor. Though the motion is not legally binding, it raises uncertainty about how the government will proceed. What is the ReArm Europe plan? The EU's ReArm Europe plan, presented by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, seeks to mobilize nearly €800 billion($872 billion) to strengthen European defense. The funding structure includes a €150 billion loan scheme secured against unused EU budget funds, as well as relaxed fiscal rules that could unlock €650 billion in additional spending.  EU leaders met in Brussels last week to significantly increase defense investments after Donald Trump halted US military support for Ukraine. Von der Leyen stressed that the plan is essential for Europe's security, stating, ""ReArm Europe could mobilize close to €800 billion for a safe and resilient Europe. We will continue working closely with our partners in NATO. This is a moment for Europe.” However, critics in the Netherlands argue that financing the plan would increase national debt, further dividing the government on the issue. NATO and its economic considerations NATO Secretary General and former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has publicly backed the plan, with members of his party warning that it would be ""irresponsible” for the Netherlands to withdraw support.

According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), the country's GDP grew by 0.4% in Q4 2024, outperforming the EU's overall growth rate of 0.1% for the same period.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrjg1d7z1o,"Ireland is ready to work with the United States to bring ""just, lasting and sustainable peace"" to Ukraine and the Middle East, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has said. The comments come as MicheÃ¡l Martin presented US President Donald Trump with a bowl of shamrocks in the White House as part of St Patrick's Day celebrations. It follows a bilateral meeting between the two leaders where the president raised a ""massive"" trade imbalance with Ireland and accused the European Union of treating the US ""very badly"". Earlier on Wednesday, the EUannounced it will impose counter tariffs on â
26bn ($28bn) worth of US goods from next month. At the shamrock presentation ceremony on Wednesday evening, Martin referenced the US intervention during in the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and its role in the creation of the Good Friday Agreement. ""The story of peace in Ireland is one that we wrote together,"" the taoiseach said. ""We know that building peace is a difficult and painstaking task but when the mighty United States of America puts its shoulder to the wheel, there is no mountain it cannot move."" Martin also praised Trump's ""unrelenting focus and energy"" in bringing peace to Ukraine and the Middle East. ""In my view, there is nothing more noble than the pursuit of peace and this is what you are doing,"" he added. In remarks beforehand, President Trump said he ""loves the Irish"". ""We're always going to have that special friendship,"" he said. ""The bond between our nations is as old as our country itself."" Earlier, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump addressed the ""massive deficit"" with Ireland. ""We want to sort of even that out as nicely as we can, and we'll work together."" Martin told President Trump that foreign investment is a two-way street, adding that Ireland is ""investing a lot more in America now"". The EU's move is in retaliation toPresident Trump's 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports into the US, which came into effect overnight. Trump said it had caused ""ill will"". ""The European Union's been very tough, and it's our turn too. We get a turn at that also,"" he said. ""I'm not knocking it, they are doing what they are doing for the EU, but it does create ill will and you know we are going to do reciprocal tariffs,"" he added. Official figures from Ireland's statistics agency suggest the country had a goods-trade surplus with the US of just over â
50bn (Â
41.6bn) in 2024. Ireland's goods exports to the US were â
72.6bn (Â
60.4bn) in 2024 while its imports from the US were â
22.5bn (Â
18.7bn). Trump said that the EU was ""set up in order to take advantage of the United States"". When asked if Ireland was also taking advantage of the US, Trump said: ""Of course."" ""I have great respect for Ireland, for what they did and they should have done just what they did. But the United States shouldn't have let that happen. We had stupid leaders, we had leaders who didn't have a clue."" He added: ""All of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies, this beautiful island of five million people has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasps. ""The Irish are smart, smart people and you took our pharmaceutical companies - and other companies - but you know, through taxation, proper taxation, they made it very, very good for companies to move up there,"" he added. Trump also said that if he drained Ireland of all the US companies ""maybe I'd lose the Irish vote"". ""We don't want to do anything to hurt Ireland, but we do want fairness and [Martin] understands that,"" he added. However, Martin said the pharmaceutical companies ""are doing very well in Ireland"", and that there was room to discuss a deal. ""I think there's room for those companies to grow in America and many of them, by the way, have already announced fairly significant manufacturing investments now [in the US],"" the taoiseach added. Martin said Ireland had served the US companies well with a strong, educated workforce and access to the EU single market. The president said Ireland's housing crisis was caused by the country ""doing so well"". Housing availability and cost is a major political and social issue in Ireland, with reportsstating thousands of new homes every yearare needed to keep up with demand. ""You know why they have a housing crisis? Because they're doing so well, they can't produce houses fast enough,"" Trump said. Martin added it was a ""good answer"". However the remark has drawn criticism from opposition parties, with Sinn FÃ©in stating that joking about the housing crisis is ""never a good answer"". Trump also praised Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy and MMA fighter Conor McGregor during the visit. He called McIlroy ""talented"", adding he had played a round with him three weeks ago. The president also complimented McGregor's tattoos: ""He's got the best tattoos I've ever seen"". After the bilateral meeting, both Trump and Martin travelled to Capitol Hill to attend the Friends of Ireland luncheon hosted by the US House speaker, Mike Johnson. Addressing the luncheon, Martin said Trump is a ""great friend of Ireland"" and ""we hope to welcome you back to our small island... very soon"". The United States has been a ""place of welcome and opportunity for Irish people"" for centuries, the taoiseach added. ""Our nation's green has been threaded through the rich tapestry of the United States by almost 32 million Irish-Americans."" Also speaking at the event, Trump said the ""Irish spirit is truly alive and thriving in America"". Prior to the meeting, Martin attended a breakfast hosted by Vice-President JD Vance. Speaking at the breakfast he said that the US ""has been a steadfast friend of Ireland for centuries"". He said the peace process was a ""signature achievement of US foreign policy"", adding that Ireland is ""ready to play our part in supporting work to end conflict and to secure peace in the Ukraine or in the Middle East or wherever"". Martin welcomed the ""progress that has clearly been made"" as a result of the Trump administration's ""unrelenting focus and effort"" to secure peace. Vance described the US-Ireland relationship as ""one of the great alliances and great friendships between nations"". He added that Ireland is a country with ""incredible communityâ
beautiful landscape and also a lot of interesting technological growth"". ""One of the more robust areas for us to work on with our Irish friends in the years to come is going to be technology and particularly artificial intelligence,"" he said. The taoiseach was the first EU leader to return to the Oval Office sincethe president's bust-up with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The bilateral meeting came amid heightened concern over the future of Ireland's economy, which is heavily reliant on US multinationals. Trump sees this as a trade imbalance and is keen to entice those companies back to the US. However, Martin said he would use his visit to the Oval Office to highlight an ""increasingly two-way"" trade and investment relationship. Speaking ahead of Martin's visit to the Oval Office, Democrat member of the House of Representatives Brendan Boyle told BBC News NI's The View that ""what the Trump administration is doing with respect to tariffs makes no economic sense, and it makes no sense in terms of our national security"". Boyle said that imposing tariffs on Canada suggests that no country is ""safe fully from this sort of madness"", including Ireland. He added that Martin should ""remind President Trump that Ireland, despite its small size, is one of the largest investors in the United States and one of the largest job creators in the United States"". ""On the one hand, [Trump] likes to say, you know, we're the best, he's the best, He's the greatest. Everything is a superlative. ""But then in the next breath, he says, we're suckers, we're losers, we're being taken advantage of by every other country."" Trump-appointed judge rules use of act to remove Venezuelans is unlawful. The BBC's analysis editor looks at what has been agreed in the much-anticipated agreement. Waltz was under pressure after a journalist was mistakenly added to a group chat in which senior officials were discussing military strikes.

https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202503120011,"Taipei, March 12 (CNA) Premier Cho Jung-tai (å	8d	93æ¦®æ³°) told lawmakers on Wednesday that Taiwan's government ""does not have the capacity"" to spend 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) annually on national defense. ""It is impossible [for the government] to allocate more than NT$2 trillion (US$60.73 billion) for defense spending, given the current central government's budget scale,"" Cho said at the Legislature. Taiwan's central government budgets for both 2024 and 2025 are nearly NT$3 trillion, with social welfare spending the largest expenditures. The premier was responding to questions from Kuomintang legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi (å	82	85å´	90è	90	81) about how the government would react if the United States urged Taiwan to increase its defense budget to 10 percent of GDP. Fu said 10 percent would be NT$2.68 trillion, based on a government 2025 GDP estimate of NT$26.88 trillion. U.S. President Donald Trump had previously touched upon the issue during his presidential campaign, calling on Taiwan to raise its defense spending to as much as 10 percent. The calls were renewed earlier this month by Trump's pick for undersecretary of defense for policy Elbridge Colby in a Senate hearing. Trump ""has made the same demand [for defense budget increases] not only of Taiwan but also of many other countries,"" Cho said. ""Currently, the Republic of China (Taiwan's official name) does not have the capability to allocate a defense budget of NT$2.6 trillion,"" he said, adding that the budget would be determined based on the country's financial capacity and military needs. Taiwan's Cabinet had earmarked NT$647 billion for defense spending in 2025, equal to 2.45 percent of GDP, some of which was later cut or frozen by the opposition-controlled Legislature. President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸	85å¾·) later pledged to propose a special budget to raise defense spending to over 3 percent of GDP, though that, too, would require legislative approval. On Wednesday, Cho denied claims made by former legislator Kuo Cheng-liang (é	83	adæ	ad£äº®) in a recent political talk show that Washington had urged Taipei to extend compulsory military service from the current one year to two. There were no such discussions in the government or requests from the U.S., Cho said, stressing that ""the status quo remains unchanged.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gdjd57lro,"Somali security forces have ended a deadly 24-hour siege by Islamist fighters who stormed a popular hotel in the central city of Beledweyne, authorities said. The attack by al-Shabab began with a car bomb exploding, followed by gunmen entering the hotel, leading to intense clashes with security forces. ""The attackers have been neutralised. Some detonated themselves while others were killed by police forces,"" Omar Osman Calasow, the mayor of Beledweyne district, told the BBC. The mayor said seven people had been killed in the attack but witnesses said the death toll could be higher. The raid at the Qahira Hotel took place as politicians, security officials and traditional elders were meeting to discuss plans for an offensive against al-Shabab in central Somalia. Police officer Ali Mahad told AFP news agency that most of those in attendance had been rescued. A federal lawmaker from Beledweyne, Dahir Amin Jesow, told the BBC that about seven gunmen had attacked the hotel. It is unclear how many people have been wounded, but the lawmaker said they were trying to organise planes to fly victims to Mogadishu for treatment. Parts of the hotel were reduced to rubble as government forces and gunmen exchanged fire, shopkeeper Ali Suleiman, who witnessed the attack, told the Reuters news agency. ""We first heard a huge blast followed by gunfire, then another blast was heard,"" he said. Calasow said the 24-hour siege ended on Wednesday morning, leaving ""significant damage"". ""Among those killed in the attack were military officers, traditional elders, and soldiers,"" Calasow added. Al-Shabab said it had killed 20 people, including government officials and leaders of a pro-government clan militia. The federal government said it was still investigating and has not commented on the reported killing of the officials. In a statement, Ali Abdullahi Hussein, the president of Hirshabelle state, praised the security forces for their bravery in neutralising the extremist militants. ""Let us unite to complete the elimination of these brutal extremists,"" Hussein added.

https://apnews.com/article/trump-eu-tariffs-countermeasures-806a3b9bcc9cd4e45817e672d95f0070,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Major trade partners swiftly hit back at President Donald Trump’s increased tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, imposing stiff new taxes on U.S products from textiles and water heaters to beef and bourbon. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminum to the U.S., said Wednesday it will place 25% reciprocal tariffs on steel products and also raise taxes on a host of items: tools, computers and servers, display monitors, sports equipment, and cast-iron products.

(AP Photo Meissner, File) Across the Atlantic, the European Union will raise tariffs on American beef, poultry, bourbon and motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans. Combined, the new tariffs will cost companies billions of dollars, and further escalate the uncertainty in two of the world’s major trade partnerships. Companies will either take the losses and earn fewer profits, or, more likely, pass costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices. Prices will go up, in Europe and the United States, and jobs are at stake, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers,” von der Leyen said. President Donald Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising that the taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown. The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. EU officials have made clear that the tariffs — taxes on imports — are aimed at products made in Republican-held states, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska and wood products from Alabama and Georgia. The tariffs will also hit blue states such as Illinois, the No. 1 U.S. producer of soybeans, which are also on the list. Spirits producers have becomecollateral damagein the dispute over steel and aluminum. The EU move “is deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild U.S. spirits exports in EU countries,” said Chris Swonger, head of the Distilled Spirits Council. The EU is a major destination for U.S. whiskey, with exports surging 60% in the past three years after an earlier set of tariffs was suspended. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the world’s biggest trading bloc, the EU, was expecting U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Von der Leyen said in a statement that the EU “will always remain open to negotiation.” Canada’s incomingPrime Minister Mark Carneysaid Wednesday he’s ready to meet with Trump if he shows “respect for Canadian sovereignty″ and is willing to take ”a common approach, a much more comprehensive approach for trade.″ Carney, who will be sworn in Friday, said workers in both countries will be better off when “the greatest economic and security partnership in the world is renewed, relaunched. That is possible.” “We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,” she said. The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures “will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.” “The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,” the chamber said Wednesday.

(AP Photo Cherry) Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. TheEU also imposed countermeasuresin retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items. This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First on April 1, the commission will reimpose taxes that were in effect from 2018 and 2020, but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.

(AP Photo Curtis) He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip “that the EU is not the problem.” “I argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,” Å efÄoviÄ told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Canada is imposing, as of 12:01 a.m. Thursday 25% reciprocal tariffs on steel products worth $12.6 billion Canadian (US$8.7 billion) and aluminum products worth $3 billion Canadian (US$2 billion) as well as additional imported U.S. goods worth $14.2 billion Canadian ($9.9 billion) for a total of $29.8 billion (US$20.6 billion.) The list of additional products affected by counter-tariffs includes tools, computers and servers, display monitors, water heaters, sport equipment, and cast-iron products. These tariffs are in addition to Canada’s 25% counter tariffs on $30 billion Canadian (US$20.8 billion) of imports from the U.S. that were put in place on March 4 in response to other Trump tariffs that he’s delayed by a month. The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports. The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services. ___ McHugh reported from Frankfurt and Gillies from Toronto.

The two sides held the second round of rare metal cooperation committee meetings in Seoul earlier in the day as a follow-up measure to the agreement on rare metals supply cooperation reached between their prime ministers in 2023, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. The cooperation will help Mongolia develop its mineral resources, while allowing South Korea to stabilize its supply chain, the ministry explained. Mongolia has various rare metal reserves, including rare earth elements. It is the world's eighth-largest producer of molybdenum, a key metal used to make steel alloy. By November, the two countries will complete installing necessary equipment and infrastructure for the operation of their joint cooperation center on rare metals.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-to-hold-talks-with-lebanon-on-border-dispute-releases-detainees-as-gesture/,"Israel and Lebanon agreed on Tuesday to open negotiations to delineate the border between the two countries, the Prime Ministerâ	 Office said. After a four-way meeting with the US and France at the United Nations peacekeeping force headquarters in Naqoura, the two sides also announced that three joint working groups would be established. The teams will focus on the five points Israel still occupies inside of Lebanon, the Blue Line that marks the de facto border between Israel and Lebanon, the points that are under dispute, and Lebanese citizens held by Israel. Israel also agreed to release five Lebanese detainees as a â	gesture to the new Lebanese president,â	 Joseph Aoun, the PMO said, adding that the release is coordinated with the US. Lebanon said it had received the four Lebanese â	 according to a statement by the Lebanese presidentâ	 office on X. Citing two US officials, Axiosreportedthat one of the Lebanese nationals released by Israel is a member of Hezbollah. According to reports in Lebanon, a total of 11 Lebanese nationals are currently being held by Israel. The working groups could meet as early as next month, according to Axios. Jerusalem and Beirutnegotiateda maritime boundary in 2022 â	 an agreement brokered by the US â	 but the two countries have yet to adopt an official land border. A November 27, 2024, truce in Lebanon largely halted more than a year of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, including two months of full-blown war during which Israel sent in ground troops. The fighting began with attacks by the terror group on the Jewish state on October 8, 2023, in support of ally Hamas, which had invaded Israel from Gaza a day earlier. Persistent rocket fire from Lebanon displaced some 60,000 Israeli civilians. â	 US Deputy Presidential Special Envoy Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. â	We look forward to quickly convening these diplomat-led working groups to resolve outstanding issues, along with our international partners.â	 Despite the diplomatic breakthrough, combat continued in Lebanon on Tuesday, with an Israeli drone strike in the southern part of the country killing a Hezbollah operative, a military source said. The strike on a car in the Nabatieh area in southern Lebanon on Tuesday targeted a Hezbollah commander in the terror groupâ	 aerial defense unit, said the IDF. He was identified by the military as Hassan Abbas Izzedine. Lebanese media outlets published images of the vehicleâ	 remains between the villages of Deir Zahrani and Humin al-Fawqa in Southern Lebanon. The IDF said he was a â	 in Hezbollahâ	 aerial defense unit and led attempts to rebuild the unitâ	 infrastructure that was decimated during the war. Izzedine also worked to procure new equipment for the unit, which posed a threat to Israeli military aircraft, the IDF added. Another Israeli Air Force strike in southern Lebanon targeted a group of Hezbollah operatives who were identified at a facility belonging to the Iran-backed group, according to the IDF. The IDF also carried out airstrikes on Friday night in southern Lebanon, saying it targeted a Hezbollah operative and sites used to store weapons and rocket launchers, adding that the strikes were carried out due to the threat they posed to Israel. Separately on Tuesday, the IDF carried out an airstrike on suspects in Gaza that were threatening Israeli forces, it said in a statement. The territoryâ	 Hamas-affiliated civil emergency service said the strike killed four people. According to the IDF, the drone strike targeted a group of Gazans near the Netzarim checkpoint, south of Gaza City. The military said the strike was ordered â	 The suspects were planting a bomb, a military source said. IDF troops are still deployed inside a buffer zone along the Gaza border amid an uncertain ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that officially ended at the beginning of the month. The IDF has repeatedly warned Palestinians against approaching the area. Over the weekend, the IDFcarried outairstrikes in Gaza, targeting operatives planting a bomb and another group operating a drone. In recent weeks, there have been several attempts to smuggle contraband into the Gaza Strip, with the IDF saying suspects on the Israeli side load up drones with weapons or drugs and fly them over the border. The strikes in Lebanon and Gaza came during ceasefires on both primary war fronts, but Israel has said it will continue to act against terror operatives who are in breach of the truces and who pose a threat to its forces. Last month, Israel withdrew all its forces from southern Lebanon, except five strategic points, saying it had received a green light from the US to remain at those posts and citing the need to prevent Hezbollah from returning to the area and threatening Israel. In Gaza, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that began on January 19, which has seen 33 Israelis returned. They are now in talks to extend it, though Jerusalem has warned it could soon resume fighting if Hamas does not continue to release hostages. Agencies contributed to this report.

https://apnews.com/article/greenland-trump-arctic-election-7d7fb1f07e1df2f28924e010073318e5,"NUUK, Greenland (AP) — The polling station in Greenland’s capital closed Tuesday in a parliamentary election that will determine the leaders who will confront U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to take control of the strategically placed Arctic country. Huge crowds streamed into the polling station in the capital, Nuuk, throughout the day, warmed by sunny skies. Exhausted voting officials closed the polls well after the planned 8 p.m. local time (2200 GMT) to make sure everyone in line got a chance to cast their ballot. Unofficial election results should be available in the coming hours, but they won’t be certified for weeks as paper ballots make their way to the capital from remote settlements by boat, plane and helicopter. Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede in February called elections a bit early, saying the country needed to be united during a “serious time” that is unlike anything Greenland has ever experienced. Greenland, a self-governing region of Denmark, straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and has rich deposits of the rare earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology. Trump has been outspoken about his desire to control Greenland, telling a joint session of Congress last week that he thought the U.S. was going to get it “one way or the other.” While the island of 56,000 people has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009, a break from Denmark isn’t on the ballot — even though it’s on everyone’s mind. Voters will instead elect 31 lawmakers who will shape the island’s future at a defining moment in history: Should Greenland declare independence? The mood was festive Tuesday at the sole polling station in Greenland’s capital city, Nuuk, as election workers opened the doors to cheers at 1100 GMT. Opinion polls show most Greenlanders favor independence. Most say they don’t dislike Americans, pointing to the good relations they have with the local Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, where U.S. military personnel have been stationed since 1951. But Greenlanders show no sign of wanting to become Americans. Even some of Trump’s biggest fans cling to the principle that they should control their destiny: their mantra is that Greenland is open for business, but not for sale. “The situation has changed because of Trump and because of the world,” said Doris Jensen, representative of the social democratic Siumut party who said she has always favored independence. “So we have decided in our party that we have to do (it) more quickly.” Trump’s attention has transformed the deeply local process of democracy. Suddenly, the presence of journalists from as far away as Japan and Croatia are reminders that these are far from normal times. Voter Sofia Rossen had a message for Trump: “Stop talking about Greenland. Stop,” she said in the polling station in Nuuk. The island and the U.S. previously had a positive relationship, but that doesn’t mean they want to be part of the United States, she told The Associated Press. Greenland’s future must be decided by its people, she said. “It is us, we are living here and we know what to do,” she said. “We are not for sale. We are not American, we won’t be Americans. We are not (Danes), but we are part of the Danish community.” “I think most of us have been scared since the new year because of (Trump’s) interest,” Pipaluk Lynge, a member of parliament from the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit, or United Inuit party, told The Associated Press. “So we’re really, really looking to Europe right now to see if we could establish a stronger bond with them to secure our sovereign nation.” After one of the final televised debates at a school auditorium in Nuuk, Prime Minister Egede was greeted by about 75 supporters who were almost outnumbered by photographers and cameramen. “All these reporters are frightening to us,’’ said Aviaja Sinkbaek, who works at the school. “It means that something must be happening soon.” She added: “I wonder what Trump has up his sleeve.” Politics in Greenland have a different rhythm. Debates during campaigning rarely got heated. People who became too animated were asked to step outside. Issues included building a skilled workforce and how to decorate the new airport, which in November opened a runway long enough to handle jumbo jets. On Tuesday, political parties pitched tents outside the polling station at the Nuuk sports hall, offering hot drinks and Greenlandic cake — a raisin-laced bread served with butter — in hopes of swaying voters. Certifying results will take weeks as ballot papers make their way to Nuuk. That’s because there are no roads connecting communities across the island’s 2.16 million square kilometers (836,330 square miles). Now the vast size has drawn outsize attention. Greenlanders know what they have. They hope the rare earth minerals will help diversify an economy where government jobs account for 40% of employment. But the government has imposed strict rules to protect the environment on the island, most of which is covered by ice year-round. The harsh atmospheric conditions raise questions about whether mineral extraction is commercially feasible. SUVs caused a traffic jam on the main road to the hall. Elderly people with canes tromped up the icy roads. A lot was at stake. And so the people came. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Any vessel that violates the group's ""ban on the passage of all Israeli ships"" will be targeted. This will continue ""until the crossings to the Gaza Strip are reopened and aid, food, and medicine are allowed in,"" the Houthi terror group's military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said on behalf of the Houthi leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi. This announcement follows al-Houthi's Friday statement that the terror group would resume its naval operations against Israel if Israel did not lift a blockage of aid into Gaza within four days. The Houthis, who control most of Yemen, also said in February that they would take military action if the US and Israel tried to displace Palestinians from Gaza forcibly. Iran's state news agency, IRNA, noted on Friday that al-Houthi warned ""that Yemen cannot tolerate the escalation of tension, the prevention of aid entry into Gaza, or the return of famine to this region of Palestine.

https://apnews.com/article/portugal-government-collapse-confidence-vote-2e081d0d60954cb1449636e420e0e687,"LISBON, Portugal (AP) — Portugal’s minority government lost a confidence vote in parliament Tuesday, forcing its resignation and bringing the European Union country’s third general election in three years. The government’s fall marks the worst spell of political instability since Portugal adopted a democratic system more than 50 years ago in the wake of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, which ended a four-decade dictatorship. A string of minority governments has been unable to forge alliances that might ensure the administration completes its constitutional four-year term without opposition parties teaming up to bring it down. A new election, likely in May, pitches the country of 10.6 million people into months of political uncertainty just as it is in the process of investing more than 22 billion euros ($24 billion) in EU development funds. The European continent, meanwhile, is facing immediate challenges to its security and economy. Voter discontent with a return to the polls could play into the hands of the radical-right populist party Chega (Enough), which has fed off frustration with mainstream parties. Portugal has been caught up in the rising European tide of populism, with Chega surging into third place in last year’s election. The government asked for the confidence vote, saying it was needed to “dispel uncertainty” about its own future amid a simmering political crisis that has focused on Social Democrat Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and distracted attention from government policy. After more than three hours of at times loud debate and following dramatic late twists as the government tabled proposals to avoid its defeat, the government called an hourlong recess and lawmakers went into a huddle. The government said it made a last-minute offer to the Socialists. Silence fell on the chamber after the result was announced. “Things are how they are. We gave our all,” Montenegro, the prime minister, told reporters as he left the National Assembly, Portugal’s parliament. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos, the leader of the largest opposition party, described the government’s conduct as “shameful,” saying it resorted to “maneuvers, games, tricks” to survive. The controversy has revolved around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Montenegro’s family law firm. Montenegro, who says he’ll stand for reelection, has denied any wrongdoing. He said he placed control of the firm in the hands of his wife and children when he became Social Democratic leader in 2022 and has not been involved in its running. It recently emerged that the firm is receiving monthly payments from a company that has a major gambling concession granted by the government, among other sources of revenue. The exact vote count wasn’t immediately available, but the speaker of parliament Jose Pedro Aguiar-Branco said the center-right government was defeated. The government, a two-party alliance led by the Social Democratic Party in power for less than a year, had just 80 seats in the current 230-seat legislature. An overwhelming majority of opposition lawmakers had vowed to vote against it. The center-left Socialists and Chega, which together hold 128 seats, voted against the government.

https://apnews.com/article/congo-goma-m23-mpox-disease-outbreak-97ce140be2d7069aa0428a25011bba99,"MITI MURHESA, Congo (AP) — Hospitals across eastern Congo that were once at the forefront of the country’s response to the mpox outbreak are facing a setback in detecting the disease and offering treatment following the advance of Rwanda-backed rebels in the region. The mpox global health emergency is worsening as the fighting between the M23 rebel group and Congolese troops escalates in eastern Congo, which has been the epicenter of the health crisis. Many patients have fled and can’t be found. Recently arrived vaccines are running short as supplies can’t reach combat zones. Hospitals have been under attack. The Associated Press visited one of the mpox hot spots, which is now under control of M23 rebels backed by neighboring Rwanda. Health workers and remaining patients described a growing disaster. “The situation has been very difficult. Insecurity has disrupted everything,” said Dr. Serge Munyahu Cikuru, medical officer in charge of the Miti Murhesa health zone in South Kivu province’s Kabare territory. The country, meanwhile, continues to battle other diseases in the east, including cholera and measles, in addition to mysterious outbreaks that recently started in the northwestern region. Cases are not being reported as before Congo saw a 31% weekly increase in mpox cases last week, bringing the total to 16,255, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, that is only one side of the story: Only seven out of the 26 provinces reported cases last week, the public health agency said at its last briefing, partly blaming the security crisis. Although Congo has seen a surge in the current vaccination phase as compared to the previous one, much of that success is in other regions while eastern Congo remains cut off. The Miti Murhesa treatment center is fast running out of supplies. Mubake Buroko Patrick, an mpox patient at the facility, said it was difficult to get drugs in the weeks following the fighting. “The war has complicated our access to medicines,” he said. “I’m feeling a little better, but the treatment needs to be improved.” Africa CDC’s mpox incident manager Dr. Ngashi Ngongo told reporters last week that authorities have started negotiations for a humanitarian corridor, which would require the suspension of hostilities to allow for humanitarian access in conflict zones. Patients are fleeing in fear More than 600 mpox patients fled different hospitals in eastern Congo as the fighting escalated, the Africa CDC said. Many of the fleeing patients were in the Miti Murhesa health zone, one of the hardest hit in the mpox outbreak. At least 4,700 cases were reported there as of the end of 2024, according to the zone’s chief medical officer Dr. Cikuru. Only two of the four treatment centers in the zone are currently functional while others are among numerous health facilities affected by the fighting between government forces and M23, he said. As M23 seized Goma and Bukavu, their fighters were expanding their presence in the region, including in other parts of North Kivu and South Kivu provinces where they had been present for years. Many patients in Miti Murhe have had to “choose between staying under fire or fleeing” the rebels, Dr. Cikuru said. Tracing patients to prevent spread of mpox has become more difficult and health workers are running out of options on how to make the best of remaining medical supplies, he said. “Our fear is an increase in the number of cases due to the current situation,” the doctor said. “Patient care in the treatment centers continues, but the shortage of medicines is a major concern.” —— Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria.

https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-begs-ukraine-to-spare-russian-oil-pipelines-after-drone-strike-cuts-off-flow/,"Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary were interrupted on Tuesday after Ukraine launched a major wave of drone strikes against Moscow, just months after Budapest secured a sweetheart deal with Kyiv that allows it to keep buying supplies of fuel despite the invasion. In a video statement posted online, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said that ""oil deliveries on the Druzhba oil pipeline to Hungary had to be temporarily suspended"" following the drone attack. ""I have just spoken to Russia's deputy energy minister, who said that a drone hit at a measuring station has made deliveries impossible for the time being, but that repair work is underway and, unless something extraordinary happens, oil deliveries to Hungary could resume in the late afternoon or early evening."" Szijjártó called on Ukraine ""not to attack the energy infrastructure directed to Hungary"" as Kyiv works to weaken Russia's war machine. Kyiv's armed forces said Tuesday that they had ""struck a number of strategic objects of the Russian Federation involved in ensuring armed aggression against Ukraine."" Budapest has used what was supposed to be a temporary exemption to an European Union ban on Russian oil to step up its purchases of crude via the overland pipeline network, making major profits from discounted crude. In September, Ukraine signed off on an agreement that would allow Hungary to continue buying Russian oil despite having itself imposed sanctions on one of its major suppliers. Under the arrangement, the fuel is considered to be Hungarian the moment it crosses the border into Ukrainian territory, allowing it to transit the country. Hungary has repeatedly threatened to veto any efforts by the EU to further reduce its dependency on Russian energy. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán
last week blocked what would have otherwise been unanimous approval for a statement by European leaders affirming support for Ukraine and tougher sanctions on Moscow. In a
message posted online
on Tuesday, Ukraine's sanctions envoy, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, accused Hungary of using the ""Druzhba pipeline problem as an argument to block the continuation of sanctions"" at an EU level, arguing Budapest is undermining ""the unity of the EU.""",Hungary begs Ukraine to spare Russian oil pipelines after drone strike cuts off flow,"Gabriel Gavin, Csongor Körömi",POLITICO,2025-03-11T10:57:21,2025-03-11T11:26:46,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/north-sea-oil-tanker-fire-still-raging-us-probes-causes/,"LONDON — A 59-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter after a cargo ship collided with an oil tanker carrying jet fuel for the U.S. military off the coast of eastern England. United States, Portuguese and British authorities are currently probing the North Sea crash that set both vessels alight and triggered a major rescue operation. There is ""no evidence"" of foul play, the British government said Tuesday, as it confirmed its ""working assumption"" is that one of the sailors involved had died. The U.S. Stena Immaculate chemical tanker was carrying around 35 million liters of aviation fuel for the U.S. Navy’s	Military Sealift Command. The fuel has a high boiling point, meaning it evaporates slowly and is relatively toxic. It collided with the Portuguese Solong vessel, which, according to its German owners Ernst Russ AG, included containers that had previously held the toxic material sodium cyanide. The company stressed in a statement Tuesday that those containers were empty at the point of impact and ""will continue to be monitored."" CBS News cited an unnamed American sailor on board the Stena Immaculate who said “a massive ship came from out of the blue"" and collided with the tanker. In a fresh development Tuesday afternoon, Humberside Police announced that a 59-year-old man had been taken into custody. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Nicholson said: ""Extensive work has already been carried out and we are working closely with our partners to understand what happened, and to provide support to all of those affected. ""Following inquiries undertaken by my team, we have arrested a 59-year-old man on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision, this follows the conclusion of search operations by HM Coastguard for the missing crew member of the Solong."" The man remains in custody, the force said, and police will ""continue speaking with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident."" One crew member from the Solong is still missing, and now believed dead, with a search called off Monday night. Its other 13 members are accounted for, with all 23 crew members on the Stena Immaculate also accounted for. Updating the House of Commons Tuesday, Maritime Minister Mike Kane said: ""Our working assumption is that, very sadly, the sailor is deceased. The coast guard has informed the company, and it has been advised to inform the next of kin."" But he stressed: ""Whether there was foul play, I think, is speculation. There is no evidence to suggest that."" A spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday that the Marine and Coast Guard Agency — which leads counter-pollution work in British waters — had ""a range of equipment"" at its disposal to ""contain and disperse"" spills. They added: ""I understand that there doesn't appear to be any suggestions of foul play at this time."" As the flag states for the ships involved, U.S. and Portuguese authorities are leading the investigation into the collision. Fellow government minister Matthew Pennycook said Tuesday that they were being assisted by U.K. authorities to assess the potential environmental impact. He vowed the three countries would “get to the bottom of why this incident happened."" The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed Monday night it was sending investigators to the U.K. to assist the probe. A Coast Guard spokesperson said it was ""actively engaged with the United Kingdom’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch and Portugal’s Marine Safety Investigation Authority to coordinate joint evidence-collection efforts” at the scene of the crash. ""Investigators from the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are deploying to the United Kingdom to conduct the investigation over the coming days,” they added. “Our team is actively engaged with all local authorities, and we will work with clean-up teams to ensure every effort is made to mitigate further impacts on the marine environment,"" said a spokesperson for Ernst Russ AG.

Rescue teams and security forces arrived at the scene, launching an operation to track down the assailants.

https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250311-european-nato-paris-ukraine,"French President Emmanuel Macron
on Tuesday called on military chiefs from across Europe and beyond to draw up a plan ""to define credible security guarantees"" for Ukraine
in the event of a ceasefire, the presidency said. His appeal, in a closed-door Paris meeting of top brass from more than 30 allied states, came as Ukraine endorsed an American proposal for a month-long ceasefire and agreed to immediate negotiations with Russia, in pivotal talks in Jeddah. Macron has sought to rally a European response to Washington's shock policy shift in US-Russia relations. The Paris meeting gathered representatives from 34 countries
– most of them from Europe and NATO, but also from Australia, New Zealand and Japan. There was no representative from the United States, which is the leading member of NATO. ""This is the moment when Europe must throw its full weight behind Ukraine, and itself,"" Macron told the meeting, according to the Élysée. France pushes shift to ‘wartime economy’ as US turns its back on Ukraine ""In view of the acceleration of peace negotiations,"" it was necessary to start planning to ""define credible security guarantees"" to make a lasting peace in Ukraine a reality, the French presidency reported Macron saying. Macron has teamed up with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to lead efforts to form a ""coalition of the willing"" to enforce an eventual ceasefire in Ukraine. According to the Élysée, the military chiefs of staff from European and NATO
nations
– including Britain and Turkey
– agreed that the security guarantees ""should not be separated from NATO and its capabilities"". Such guarantees should be ""credible and long-term, and should be accompanied by unfailing support for the Ukrainian army"", according to the Élysée. More than three years since Russia invaded its neighbour, Europe is scrambling to boost its defences and break free from dependence on the United States. It has been unsettled by Trump renewing contacts with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and criticising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, raising fears that the US president may try to force Ukraine to accept a settlement favouring Russia. Trump has also suspended military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. Ahead of the meeting, French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said: ""We will reject any form of demilitarisation of Ukraine."" ""It is simply a question of looking ahead and thinking about what the Ukrainian army should be in the future,"" Lecornu added. Full address: Macron calls for major European rearmament Rearmament of Europe On Friday, the French president, who has pushed his country's defence industry to switch to ""war economy mode"", is set to meet with defence manufacturers, according to a member of his team. After Tuesday's talks, defence ministers from Europe's five main military powers
– France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Poland
– are to meet in the French capital on Wednesday. EU and NATO representatives and the Ukrainian defence minister will also take part. Those talks will centre on the ""necessary rearmament of Europe"" and military support to Ukraine, one of Lecornu's aides has said. Starmer will, in turn, host virtual talks on Saturday with leaders of the nations willing to help support the ceasefire. Macron has said any European troops in Ukraine would be deployed only ""once a peace deal is signed, to guarantee it is fully respected"". He has also said he would be ready to discuss extending France's nuclear deterrent to European partners. Last week, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen unveiled a plan to mobilise around 800 billion euros ($843 billion) for Europe's defence and help provide ""immediate"" military support for Ukraine. France also plans to raise defence spending, with Lecornu referring to a target of around 100 billion euros a year, compared to 50.5 billion in 2025.

https://apnews.com/article/canada-ontario-us-trump-tariffs-electricity-834dc3d9defd314923912f9bd8540e31,"TORONTO (AP) — Ontario’s premier, the leader of Canada’s most populous province, announced that effective Monday it is charging 25% more for electricity to 1.5 million American homes and businesses in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war. Ontario provides electricity to Minnesota, New York and Michigan. “I will not hesitate to increase this charge. If the United States escalates, I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference in Toronto. “Believe me when I say I do not want to do this. I feel terrible for the American people who didn’t start this trade war. It’s one person who is responsible, it’s President Trump.” Ford said Ontario’s tariff would remain in place despite the one-month reprieve from Trump, noting a one-month pause means nothing but more uncertainty. Quebec is also considering taking similar measures with electricity exports to the U.S. Minnesota receives only a small share of its electricity from Ontario, but Democratic Gov. Tim Walz was sharply critical of Trump’s actions that led to Monday’s announcement from Ford. “The first victims of Trump’s Trade war? Minnesotans struggling to pay their skyrocketing electric bill,” Walz said on X with a link to a story about Ontario’s move. “Minnesotans cannot afford Trump’s billionaire-run economy. We have to put a stop to this madness.” In a brief press availability later Monday, Walz acknowledged that Minnesota doesn’t get a lot of electricity from Ontario, but he’s worried about Manitoba following suit. “So look, even if it were one megawatt, this is totally unnecessary. And the fact of the matter is, it doesn’t impact Donald Trump one bit. It impacts ratepayers in Minnesota. For what? These are our friends,” he said. Walz said he’s even more worried about the impact on Minnesota if Canadian potash fertilizer gets caught up in the trade war. “If it starts with this, the one that I’m really worried about is potash, when it comes behind it. If they do potash, that’s a big one on agriculture,” he said. Walz said he discussed these concerns last week when he spoke with the premiers of Ontario and Manitoba. He said they told him the dispute is broader than just their trading relations with Minnesota. “They were very clear that it’s not Minnesota -- we’re huge trading partners.” Minnesota Power, the main electrical utility serving the part of Minnesota that borders Ontario, gets only a “very small” proportion of its power from the province, company spokesperson Amy Rutledge said. Minnesota Power bought only about $300,000 worth of electricity from Ontario last year, and only for four months out of the year. The utility serves over 150,000 customers, mostly with power it generates itself in Minnesota, she said. While it gets about 11% of its power supply from Manitoba Hydro, she said, that’s not affected by Ontario’s announcement. At a news conference, Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he’s putting a 25 percent tax hike on electricity exports. “We really expect any impact on our customers to be negligible,” Rutledge said. Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the organization that manages a regional power grid that stretches from Manitoba to Minnesota to Louisiana, also expects little effect, spokesman Brandon Morris said. MISO gets under half its power from Canada, and less than half of that comes from Ontario, he said. Matt Helms, public information of officer for the Michigan Public Service Commission, said the impact on Michigan customers is likely to be “small” and most of Michigan’s electricity is produced by utility companies in the state or through long-term contracts. Of greater concern to the commission is the reliability of the electric grid, as electricity flows between the U.S. and Canada as part of an interconnected grid. “Any action to limit or disrupt these flows would remove a layer of protection and make all of us — Canadians and Americans alike — more vulnerable to grid-scale outages,” Helms said. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she has ordered state energy officials to conduct a review on how much the tariffs could drive up electricity and other energy costs in the state. “These federal tariffs have been poorly conceived from the start: crafted in secret with no transparency and no clear economic rationale, they’ve only served to destabilize our capital markets and create uncertainty among New York families and businesses,” said Hochul, a Democrat. The new surcharge is in addition to the federal government’s initial $30 billion Canadian dollars ($21 billion) worth of retaliatory tariffs applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products. Trump launched a new trade war last week by imposing tariffs against Washington’s three biggest trading partners, drawing immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China and sending financial markets into a tailspin. “It needs to end. Until these tariffs are off the table, until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario will not relent,” Ford said. ___ Associated Press writer Steve Karnowski in St. Paul, Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan and Anthony Izaguirre in Albany, New York contributed.

If placed, researchers from countries on the list undergo more stringent scrutiny when joining research facilities or projects affiliated with the department, potentially making it harder for them to participate in U.S. research on advanced technologies, such as atomic energy, artificial intelligence or quantum technology. Cho said his ministry received an ""unofficial tipoff"" about the DOE's review of South Korea and is working to ""grasp the situation"" based on this information. The DOE does not appear to have finalized South Korea's designation yet, the foreign minister also noted. Based on the unofficial information it has, South Korea has raised an issue with the DOE, which is now looking into the matter again, according to Cho. ""As far as I know, once the United States grasps the situation internally, it may come to us and discuss it,"" he said. Asked whether growing public calls for South Korea's nuclear armament may have influenced Washington's review, Cho acknowledged that such speculation exists. ""It is understandable that such a view is circulating as one possible explanation,"" he said. ""However, we need to see whether it is the only factor. Since the internal circumstances remain unclear, we cannot rule out the possibility that this is a one-time occurrence caused by a less significant factor than we assumed."" Once more information becomes available, the government will conduct a thorough review of the situation and take necessary measures, he added.

https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-845564,"Iranhas launched a large-scale joint naval exercise with Russia and China in the northern Indian Ocean, days after its supreme leader dismissed an offer from the US president for nuclear negotiations. The Combined Maritime Security Belt drill aims to improve maritime security and enhance coordination between the three nations while also involving observers from several other countries. Iranian Navy Deputy Operations Commander Admiral Mustafa Tajaldini described the primary goal of the exercise as strengthening naval cooperation and securing major maritime routes. â	The primary goal of this exercise is to enhance maritime security in the northern Indian Ocean and strengthen naval cooperation between the Iranian, Chinese, and Russian navies,â	Tajaldini said, as quoted by theTehran Times. He further noted the broader regional significance, pointing to critical trade routes such as the Straits of Malacca, Hormuz, and Bab el Mandeb. â	Our goal is to strengthen collective security, and weâ	ve invited Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) nations and regional countries to contribute to this effort,â	 he added. Chinaâ	’s Defense Ministry stated that the exercise includes drills on striking maritime targets, damage control, and joint search-and-rescue operations. Russiaâ	’s TASS news agency reported that the exercise features 15 combat ships, support vessels, and helicopters. Iranian media reported that observers from Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates were present in Chabahar, Iranâ	’s key port on the Gulf of Oman, for the drills. Security analysts see the exercise as a clear signal of growing military ties between Iran, Russia, and China as they seek to counterbalance US influence in the region. The Gulf of Oman, where the drills are taking place, serves as a crucial maritime passage linking the Indian Ocean to the Strait of Hormuz, through which over a quarter of the worldâ	’s seaborne oil trade passes. When asked about the naval exercises,US president Donald Trumpdismissed concerns, telling Fox News aboard Air Force One: â	Weâ	’re stronger than all of them. We have more power than all of them.â	 The exercise comes at a time of heightened tensions following Iranâ	’s rejection of nuclear talks with Washington, signaling a continued standoff in diplomatic efforts. Meanwhile, the US 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, maintains a strong presence in the region, keeping a close watch on maritime security developments.","Iran holds joint naval drill with Russia, China after rejecting US talks on nuclear program",THE MEDIA LINE STAFF,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-11T04:45:00,2025-03-11T04:49:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d4z4lnxvxo,"South Sudan's government has denied earlier reports that Uganda had deployed special forces to its capital, Juba. Uganda's military chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba said the soldiers had gone to the neighbouring country to help South Sudanese President Salva Kiir ""secure"" the city. The statement came amid escalating tensions between Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, raising fears that their fragile peace deal could collapse and a conflict could resume.  ""We shall protect the entire territory of South Sudan like it was our own,"" Gen Kainerugaba had written on the social media platform X.  Uganda's army spokesperson Felix Kulayigye also confirmed the deployment to the BBC but declined to reveal details. South Sudan's government did not immediately respond to the reports on Tuesday morning, but speaking to local media later Information Minister Michael Makuei said Ugandan troops were not in Juba. Concern about the security situation in South Sudan has been mounting, with the US on Saturday ordering the evacuation of all its non-emergency staff from the country.  Last week, the deputy chief of the army and two ministers - all allies of Machar - were arrested by the security forces, which an opposition spokesman called a ""grave violation"" of the peace deal. One of the ministers has since been released. The arrests followed clashes in the Upper Nile state between government forces and a militia known as the White Army. It had fought alongside Machar during the civil war that broke out in 2013 following  a power struggle between him and Kiir. It led to heavy fighting in Juba, with Kiir accusing Machar of plotting a coup. Machar denied the allegation, but South Sudan then plunged into a civil war that killed more than 400,000 people. A 2018 power-sharing agreement between the two stopped the fighting, but key elements of the deal have not been implemented - including a new constitution, an election and the reunification of armed groups into a single army.

https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-reports-largest-drone-attack-on-10-regions-as-ukraine-to-meet-united-states-peace-talks/,"KYIV — Ukraine launched its biggest drone attack on Moscow since the start of the war with Russia on Monday night, hours before a delegation from Kyiv was due to meet with United States representatives for peace talks in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine's armed forces ""struck a number of strategic objects of the Russian Federation involved in ensuring armed aggression against Ukraine,"" they said in astatementTuesday. TheRussian military saidit shot down 337 Ukrainian drones over 10 Russian regions. Three people were killed and 18 injured, and several residential buildings damaged, according to Russian officials. “The most massive drone attack on Moscow has been repelled tonight. Some 74 drones were shot down near Moscow, and hundreds at different frontiers,” the city's Mayor Sergei Sobyaninsaid in a statement. Russia has launched a criminal investigation into “terrorism.” Ukraine's armed forces said the attack targeted strategic facilities involved in Russia's aggression, and said that Russian air defenses were to blame for damage to ""a number of civilian infrastructure facilities."" Officials in Kyiv said the attack was a signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “All the drone strikes in Russia tonight — on Moscow, on airports and so on — are the signal to Putin that he also must be interested in a truce in the sky that Ukraine is going to offer today during talks. Not only oil refineries,"" Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Ukrainian government’s center for countering disinformation,\u00a0said in a video statement. ""Drones can also massively attack Moscow. Of course, air defense shoots down those drones. But this does not save Russians from panic.” In Jeddah on Tuesday, a Ukrainian delegation headed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov are meeting representatives from U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The talks are now underway, with Yermak writing on Telegram that they began ""very constructively,"" and they are ""working to bring about a just and lasting peace."" Asked whether Ukraine’s overnight attack was perceived as an attempt to compromise peace negotiations, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said “there is nothing to disrupt yet” as negotiations with Ukraine haven't yet started. “For now, the Americans, in their own words, are trying to understand how ready Ukraine is for peace negotiations. There are no negotiations yet, so there is nothing to disrupt here,"" said Peskov. The Trump administration, however, had a different reading of the talks' progress on Monday. The White House included bringing ""Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table through historic peace talks in Saudi Arabia in pursuit of peace,"" in alist of Trump's achievementssince taking office. The Ukrainians say they are hoping for “constructive dialogue” and a resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing, while the Americans want to determine whether Kyiv is serious about peace with Russia and\u00a0what concessions it is prepared to offer\u00a0to achieve it. “Among other things, we will offer truce in the sky and at sea. But Russians also have to agree to it. Because it is about mutual actions, but from our side it is a serious proposal,” a Ukrainian official told POLITICO, granted anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations. “We hope for constructive dialogue. And, in general, the composition of the Ukrainian delegation demonstrates that Ukraine is serious about this meeting and its goal. It is a truly high-level delegation.” Meanwhile on Tuesday, NATO leaders from 30 countries are gathering in Paris — without the U.S. — to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine and shore up support for Kyiv should Washington further withdraw. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have been leading efforts to convene a ""coalition of the willing"" that would support Ukraine with peacekeeping troops in the event of a peace deal.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/asia/iran-china-russia-joint-navy-drills-intl-hnk/index.html,"Warships from Iran, China and Russia kicked off their annual joint exercises in the Gulf of Oman on Monday, showing off their military ties as US President Donald Trump upends longstanding Western alliances. The “Security Belt-2025” drills, taking place near the Iranian port of Chabahar, is the fifth joint naval exercise Iran, China and Russia have held since 2019, according to Chinese state media. Analysts have long seen the drills as a demonstration of the growing partnership among the three authoritarian powers as they seek to counterbalance US influence and challenge the Western-led global order. But this year, the optics are even more pronounced as Trump disrupts the transatlantic alliance – a cornerstone of Western security for decades – by embracing Russia at the expense of Ukraine, and pushes Asian allies to pay more for US protection. Asked about the drills on Sunday, Trump said he is “not at all” concerned about the show of force by the three US adversaries. “We’re stronger than all of them. We have more power than all of them,” he told Fox News aboard Air Force One. Concerns have been mounting in Washington about the emerging strategic partnership among China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, which US lawmakers have described as an “axis of authoritarianism,” “axis of autocrats” and “axis of dictators.” The fear is that a shared animosity toward the US is increasingly driving these countries to work together – amplifying the threat that any one of them alone poses to Washington or its allies, not just in one region but perhaps in multiple parts of the world at the same time. At the same time, Trump has openly embraced Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a bid to end the war in Ukraine by talking directly to Moscow while leaving Kyiv and European allies on the sidelines. Russia and North Korea’s military relationship has strengthened considerably over the last year, with the two signing a mutual defense agreement and Pyongyang sending its troops to fight for Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine. The drills also come amid heightened tension between US and Iran. Related articleChina’s warships are turning up in unexpected places and alarming US allies. Is this the new normal? Since returning to the White House, Trump has restored what he calls his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in an attempt to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon – a move denounced by Tehran as “bullying” tactics. The Gulf of Oman is a crucial gateway connecting the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Hormuz, through which more than one-quarter of the world’s seaborne traded oil passes. The US maintains its own significant presence in the region via the Fifth Fleet which is based out of nearby Bahrain. Russia’s Defense Ministry said the joint naval exercises will involve 15 combat ships, support vessels and gunboats, as well as helicopters, according to state news agency TASS. “The Russian side is represented by the Rezky and Russian Hero Aldar Tsydenzhapov corvettes, and the Pechenega tanker of the Pacific Fleet,” the ministry is quoted as saying. China, meanwhile, deployed the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Baotou and supply ship Gaoyouhu from a nearby naval escort task force to take part in the exercise, the Chinese Defense Ministry said in a statement. The drills, with an aim to “enhance military trust and strengthen practical cooperation,” will include simulated strikes on maritime targets, visit-board-search-seizure operations and search and rescue drills, the ministry added. Iran has sent a stealth missile corvette and a patrol ship, according to Iranian state media.","Iran, China and Russia launch annual joint naval drills as Trump upends Western alliances",Nectar Gan,CNN,2025-03-10T06:50:01,2025-03-10T06:50:01,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/north-sea-ship-collision-coastguard-d9c97c9968d04907fb9d9e94145e9072,"LONDON (AP) — A cargo ship hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military off eastern England on Monday, setting both vessels ablaze and sending fuel pouring into the North Sea. All but one of the 37 crew of the two ships were brought safely ashore. One crew member from the cargo ship, Solong, was missing, the vessel’s owner Ernst Russ said in a statement. The ship owner said “13 of the 14 Solong crew members have been brought safely (to) shore.” The owner of the fuel tanker said all 23 of its crew members were safe. The two ships were still ablaze 12 hours after the collision, British coast guards said. They said they had ended the search for the missing crew member. They confirmed 36 others had been brought ashore, one of whom was hospitalized. The collision triggered a major rescue operation by lifeboats, coast guard aircraft and commercial vessels in the foggy North Sea. The British government said it was assessing “any counter-pollution response which may be required over the coming days.” The Marine Accident Investigation Branch was investigating the cause of the collision. The U.S.-flagged chemical and oil products tanker MV Stena Immaculate was at anchor near the port of Grimsby on Monday morning after sailing from Greece, according to ship-tracking site VesselFinder. The Portugal-flagged container ship Solong was sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands when it struck the tanker’s side. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports an oil tanker, and a cargo ship have collided off the coast of eastern England, setting both vessels on fire and triggering a major rescue operation. U.S.-based maritime management firm Crowley, which operates the Stena Immaculate, said the tanker “sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel,” when the container ship struck it, triggering a fire and “multiple explosions onboard,” with fuel released into the sea. The Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government’s Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed. The Solong’s cargo included sodium cyanide, which can produce harmful gas when combined with water, according to industry publication Lloyd’s List Intelligence. It was unclear if there had been a leak. Britain’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the alarm was raised at 9:48 a.m. (0948 GMT). Humber Coast Guard asked vessels with firefighting equipment and those who could help with search and rescue to head to the scene about 155 miles (250 kilometers) north of London. Video footage aired by British broadcasters and apparently filmed from a nearby vessel showed thick black smoke pouring from both ships. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said details of the collision and its cause “are still becoming clear.” Abdul Khalique, head of the Maritime Center at Liverpool John Moores University, said it appeared the crew of the cargo ship had not been “maintaining a proper lookout by radar” as required by international maritime regulations. Greenpeace U.K. said it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage from the collision, which took place near busy fishing grounds and major seabird colonies. Scientists said the environmental impact might be less severe than with a spill of heavier crude oil. “Whilst the images look worrying, from the perspective of the impact to the aquatic environment, it’s less of a concern than if this had been crude oil because most of the jet fuel will evaporate very quickly,” said Mark Hartl of the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Biotechnology at Scotland’s Heriot-Watt University. Mark Sephton, professor of organic geochemistry at Imperial College London, said jet fuel disintegrates more quickly than crude oil, and warmer temperatures speed biodegradation. “In the end, it all depends on the rate of introduction of fuel and the rate of destruction by bacteria,” he said. “Let’s hope the latter wins out.” ___ Associated Press journalist Krutika Pathi in London contributed.","A cargo ship hits a tanker and they catch fire off England, with one crew member missing",Jill Lawless,AP News,2025-03-10T12:15:42,2025-03-10T18:18:16,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-war-news-ba90f0de3d4f64a1762d1a39f787817f,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, officials said Sunday, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory. Hamas called it part of Israel’s “starvation policy.” Israel last week suspended supplies of goods to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of the war. Israel is pressing the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. The militant group — which has warned that discontinuing supplies would affect the hostages — said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position. Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday in an effort to “advance” the negotiations. Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The letter from Israel’s energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza. The territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam said that Israel has ”practically” cut off electricity since the war began and called the latest decision part of Israel’s “starvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.” The desalination plant was providing 18,000 cubic meters of water per day for central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah area, according to Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement. Executive director Tania Hary said that it’s expected to run on generators and produce around 2,500 cubic meters per day, about the amount in an Olympic swimming pool. Israel’s restrictions on fuel entering Gaza have a larger impact, Hary said, and water shortages are a looming issue, because fuel is needed for distribution trucks. Israel has faced sharp criticism over suspending supplies. “Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,” the U.N. human rights office said Friday. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used “starvation as a method of warfare” when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the United Nations’ inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid. The leader of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid doesn’t resume to Gaza. The Houthis described their earlier attacks as solidarity with Palestinians there. The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies. US envoy describes talks with Hamas The White House on Wednesday made the surprise confirmation of direct U.S. talks with Hamas. On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. The militant group has previously called disarming unacceptable. A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss contacts with the U.S., said that the group had expressed its longstanding position that it would lay down its arms in return for a “fair and just solution” that includes an independent Palestinian state. Boehler also told CNN that “I think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they’re not part of the political party going forward. I think that’s a reality. It’s real close.” When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, “You never know.” He added: “I think something could come together within weeks,” and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones. Boehler has said four of the five American hostages in Gaza are dead, with Edan Alexander alive. Hamas on Sunday didn’t mention the talks, but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections. Hamas’ attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Many Israelis are pressing for a deal to bring everyone home. “We are here to send a clear message to the Israeli government: stop stalling,” Zahiro Shahar Mor, nephew of slain hostage Avraham Munder, said in front of tents set up outside Israel’s defense ministry in one demonstration. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t say how many of the dead were militants. With the cutoff of supplies to Gaza, Palestinians are reporting sharp price increases for dwindling items during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. “Since the ceasefire began, the situation has improved a little. But before that, the situation was very bad,” said Fares al-Qeisi in the southern city of Khan Younis. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Follow developments at  Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250310007500315,"SEOUL, March 10 (Yonhap) -- The National Assembly kicked off a bipartisan parliamentary organization aimed at strengthening the nation's alliance with the United States on Monday, as South Korea seeks to navigate through economic fallout and reaffirm the alliance under U.S. President Donald Trump. During the meeting, acting U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Joseph Yun and Jeon Jae-sung, professor of international relations at Seoul National University, discussed the significance of the alliance and inter-parliamentary cooperation. The body, comprised of 162 lawmakers from the ruling People Power Party (PPP) and opposition parties, will have one chairperson and one secretary appointed from each side. PPP Rep. Cho Kyung-tae and Rep. Chung Dong-young of the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) will serve as chairs and PPP Rep. Cho Jung-hun and DP Rep. Kim Young-bae as secretaries. ""It is highly meaningful that this is the first official body within the National Assembly dedicated to promoting exchanges with the U.S. Congress,"" chairperson Cho said. ""We will play a crucial role in further advancing the Korea-U.S. alliance."" Unveiling his vision for strengthening parliamentary diplomacy and a roadmap for advancing high-tech industries, Cho added that the union will seek to boost bipartisan cooperation and ""maximize the strategic value of the South Korea-U.S. alliance."" National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik also stressed the importance of bolstering parliamentary cooperation at the meeting, noting that countries and businesses worldwide are paying keen attention to the policies of the new U.S. administration. ""Many countries are putting in full efforts, playing 'good cop and bad cop,'"" Woo said. ""If necessary, our government and parliament should divide our roles too.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36wkg47z1po,"Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump. The former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. In much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. ""Americans should make no mistake,"" he said. ""In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win."" Carney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks. Carney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. The Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. Carney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland. Loud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital. The party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. Carney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month. The governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country At the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls. They have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party. Much of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's ""unjustified tariffs"" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. The US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement. Canada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy. Carney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was ""attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses"". ""We can't let him succeed,"" he added, as the crowd booed loudly. He said his government would keep tariffs on US imports ""until the Americans show us respect"". Canada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed. ""I know these are dark days,"" Carney said. ""Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. ""We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead."" Carney also pledged to ""secure our borders"" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south. The US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre. ""Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,"" said Carney. ""Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him."" Shortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader. He warned that Canada was facing an ""existential challenge"" from the US under Trump. The Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being ""just like Justin"". They accuse the Liberals of a ""sneaky"" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader. Poilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. Carney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December. Federal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he ""embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues"". ""I'm really, really excited for what's coming. And frankly, it's time for an election."" The Liberals will face Poilievre's Conservatives, who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons; the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats; and the New Democrats, who have 24, when Canadians next go to the polls. The former central banker has run on a broadly centrist agenda, a shift from Trudeau, who moved the Liberals to the left. A major promise is to push forward major energy projects like pipelines, which have faced political roadblocks in recent years. He has promised major investments in housing and clean energy projects, and to liberalise trade within Canada, where barriers remain between provinces, as well as diversifying the economy away from the US. During the leadership race, Carney promised to cap the size of the federal government, which expanded 40% under Trudeau.",Mark Carney: Canada's next PM vows to win trade war with Trump,Jessica Murphy,BBC News,2025-03-09T19:05:30,2025-03-09T23:13:48,gemini-2.0-flash

Communities in southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales (NSW) were beginning the clean-up on Sunday after the storm caused widespread flooding and knocked down power lines and trees. A 61-year-old man's body was recovered from floodwaters on Saturday, while in a separate incident, 12 soldiers were taken to hospital after their convoy crashed en route to rescue operations. The storm had weakened by the time it made landfall near Brisbane on Saturday night, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday warned locals of the continued wild weather and risks from flooding. ""The situation in Queensland and northern New South Wales remains very serious due to flash flooding and heavy winds,"" Albanese said. ""Heavy rainfall, damaging wind gusts and coastal surf impacts are expected to continue over coming days."" Cyclone Alfred had hovered for days off the country's east coast as a category two cyclone before weakening into a tropical depression on Saturday. By Sunday evening, emergency services had conducted over a dozen rescues in Queensland and NSW - most involving people trapped by rising waters in their cars or homes. The NSW State Emergency Service reported receiving more than 6,000 calls for help. Almost 290,000 properties in the affected regions remain without power, and energy companies have warned residents the blackouts could persist for days. Police said on Saturday they had discovered a body in the search for a 61-year-old man who went missing on Friday after his car was caught in floodwaters in Dorrigo, northern NSW. Emergency responders witnessed the man escaping his car and climbing onto a tree near the riverbank, but rescuers were not able to reach him before he was swept away. In a separate incident on Saturday, 12 soldiers were injured in a convoy crash in Lismore, about 200km south of Brisbane, as they were on their way to rescue and recovery efforts. The soldiers were still in hospital on Sunday, two of them in a serious condition, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told a news conference. ""We wish a speedy recovery for all of those young soldiers,"" he said. Queensland's police authorities said they had not recorded any fatalities or missing people in the state so far as a result of the weather event.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250309000453315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, March 9 (Yonhap) -- Tens of thousands of people were expected to gather in Seoul on Sunday to rally for or against impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol a day after his surprise release from detention. Sarang Jeil Church, led by conservative activist pastor Jeon Kwang-hoon, held a Sunday service outdoors near the presidential residence in central Seoul. Around 4,500 people had gathered as of noon, according to an unofficial police estimate. ""With President Yoon's release, the impeachment trial has become meaningless. It's over,"" Jeon said. ""In the event the Constitutional Court does something funny, we will exercise the people's right to resist and get rid of them with a single slash."" On Saturday, Yoon was released from the detention center where he had been held since mid-January over his failed martial law bid in December, after a court ruled that his detention was invalid. Even in the absence of physical detention, Yoon still has to stand trial on charges of leading an insurrection and is awaiting the verdict of the Constitutional Court on whether to uphold or dismiss his impeachment. Conservative civic group Angry Blue was scheduled to hold a separate rally, opposing Yoon's impeachment at Bosingak Pavilion at 1 p.m. before marching along Jongno 3-ga street. An opposing rally by a group of activists calling for Yoon's immediate ouster was held overnight just outside of Seoul's Gyeongbok Palace, and the group held a press conference outside the nearby government complex Sunday to declare a week of ""emergency action"" urging Yoon's removal from office. At 2 p.m., the group will begin a march from the National Palace Museum, with the reported attendance of 100,000 people, leading to partial road closures in the area. At 7 p.m., the group held another rally near Gyeongbokgung Station, with an estimated 5,000 people taking to the streets to criticize the prosecution for letting Yoon walk without appealing the court's ruling. Representatives from the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) attended the rally, and DP Chairman Lee Jae-myung drew loud cheers when his image appeared on the screen on the stage. The activists marched toward the Constitutional Court, a little over 1 kilometer east of the subway station. They plan to gather for a rally near the station at 7 p.m. every evening until the Constitutional Court hands down its verdict on Yoon. Jeon had also said his group would also hold a daily rally in front of the court starting Monday. Meanwhile, DP demanded Prosecutor General Shim Woo-jung resign immediately to take responsibility for the prosecution's release of Yoon following the court ruling. The party threatened to consider all possible measures, including his impeachment, should the top prosecutor refuse. ""The Democratic Party will immediately file a complaint against Prosecutor General Shim Woo-jung,"" floor leader Park Chan-dae said after an emergency general meeting of lawmakers. ""Prosecutor General Shim released Yoon Suk Yeol, the ringleader of an insurrection, after voluntarily giving up the opportunity to immediately appeal the court decision (to release him) and receive the judgment of a higher court."" Also on Sunday, the DP and four other minor opposition parties -- the Rebuilding Korea Party, the Jinbo Party, the Basic Income Party and the Social Democratic Party -- agreed at a meeting of their leaders to jointly call for Shim's resignation and push for his impeachment should he refuse. The five parties also agreed to file a complaint against Shim with the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials. The ruling People Power Party stepped up its calls on the Constitutional Court to dismiss Yoon's impeachment and reinstate him. ""The Constitutional Court must keep in mind that it will face unbearable backlash in the event it hastily removes the president from office and he is later acquitted of the insurrection charges,"" a party spokesperson said. hague@yna.co.kr(END)",(3rd LD) Massive rallies held in Seoul one day after Yoon's release,Yoo Jee-ho,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-09T20:54:53,2025-03-09T20:54:53,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/09/for-the-first-time-an-election-in-greenland-will-be-closely-watched,"Greenland is the world's largest island - it's larger even than France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, and Belgium combined. But despite its size, Greenland remains a self-governing territory of Denmark and its foreign, defence and monetary policies are all decided in Copenhagen. Since 80 percent of it is permanently covered in ice, much of it remains uninhabitable. It has a tiny population of just 56,000 people, most of them indigenous Inuits. They've long taken pride in a culture and traditions that's helped them survive for centuries in some of the most rugged conditions. They have a close link to nature and belong to one of the most beautiful, remote, untouched places on Earth. But Greenlanders now find their voices greatly amplified on the world stage after President Donald Trump's outlandish claimed that the US would take over their island. Most say they donâ	 want to be American, and many are both worried and overwhelmed by the comments and the attention Trump's comments have brought. But many also see the global spotlight on them as an opportunity to promote their longstanding push for independence from Denmark, which is a key issue in Tuesday's legislative elections. Since 1979, Greenland has had its own prime minister who is able to govern at a local level. He or she has to come from the party with the most seats, which is currently the left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit party. Currently the prime minister is MÃºte Egede, who coincidentally will celebrate his 38th birthday on the day of the election. The parliament - the Inatsisartut - has just 31 MPs who will be chosen from six political parties, two of whom are in the governing coalition of the Inuit Ataqatigiit and the Simiut parties. Since few opinion polls take place on the North Atlantic island, it is less clear than in other European elections as to what the outcome might be. But one poll conducted by Verian in January asked 497 Greenlanders who they would vote for. It suggested that the Inuit Ataqatigiit party could gain about 31% and beat the Siumut party by about 9%. The Simiut party has promised a vote on independence after the election, which may help it attract more voters, and perhaps allow it to choose the next prime minister. But Naleraq is the largest opposition party, and it's been growing in popularity with its pro-independence policy and its apparent willingness to collaborate with the United States. Qupanuk Olsen, who is Greenland's most popular influencer, is running for Naleraq, and with more than 500,000 followers on TikTok and 300,000 on Instagram, she has the best online platform to campaign from. Unsurprisingly, Greenlanders are not keen for the US to take them over. Just hours after Trump declared in his speech to a joint session of Congress that he intends to gain control of the island â	 one way or the other,"" Greenlandâ	 prime minister Egede posted a simple message on Facebook: â	 Greenland is ours.â	 â	 Kalaallit Nunaat is ours,â	 Egede said in the post, using the Greenlandic name for his country. â	 We donâ	 want to be Americans, nor Danes; We are Kalaallit. The Americans and their leader must understand that. We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,â	 he said. The post ended with a clenched fist emoji and a Greenlandic flag. Since taking office six weeks ago, Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in mineral-rich Greenland, which sits along strategic sea lanes in the North Atlantic off the northeastern coast of Canada, closer to Washington than to Copenhagen. Trump made a direct appeal to Greenlanders in his speech to US Congress, just a week before the countryâ	 voters cast their ballots in parliamentary elections. â	 We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America,â	 Trump said. â	 We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before,â	 he added. Greenlanders voted overwhelmingly in favour of self-government in a 2009 referendum that also established a pathway to independence whenever the people of the island support such a move. Under the terms of that referendum, Denmark remains responsible for Greenlandâ	 defence and foreign affairs, with the local government controlling other matters. Asked about Trumpâ	 comments, Denmarkâ	 Foreign Minister Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen said he doesnâ	 think Greenlanders want to separate from Denmark only to become â	 an integrated part of America.â	 Rasmussen said he believed Trumpâ	 reference to respecting Greenlandersâ	 right to self-determination was the most important part of his speech. â	 Iâ	 m very optimistic about what will be a Greenlandic decision about this,â	 he said during a trip to Finland. â	 They want to loosen their ties to Denmark. Weâ	 re working on that, to have a more equal relationship.â	 He added that it was important for next weekâ	 elections to be free and fair â	 without any kind of international intervention.â	 Greenland is vital to the world, though much of the world may not realise it. The U.S and other global powers covet its strategic location in the Arctic; its valuable rare earth minerals trapped under the ice needed for telecommunications; its billions of barrels of untapped oil. Thereâ	 s also potential for shipping and trade routes as the ice that covers most of Greenland keeps retreating because of climate change. If that ice melts, it would reshape coastlines across the globe and potentially shift weather patterns. Denmark colonised Greenland 300 years ago and still exercises control over foreign and defence policy, though Greenland won self-rule in 1979 and runs itself through its parliament. Trumpâ	 comments about Greenland also set off a political crisis in Denmark. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen went on a tour of European capitals to garner support, saying the continent faced â	 a more uncertain reality,â	 while her country moved to strengthen its military presence around Greenland. Greenlandâ	 economy depends on fisheries and other industries as well as on an annual grant of about 554 million euros from Denmark. Aka Hansen, an Inuk filmmaker and writer, is suspicious of Trumpâ	 intentions - but still thanks him for turning the worldâ	 attention to her homeland. Like many other Greenlanders, she wants her homeland and people to be respected and she doesnâ	 want to be ruled by another colonial power. But she feels Trumpâ	 rhetoric has increased the momentum for independence from Denmark. Denmark has been accused of committing abuses against Greenlandâ	 Inuit people, including removing children from their families in the 1950s with the excuse of integrating them into Danish society and fitting women with intrauterine contraceptive devices in the 1960s and 1970s â	 allegedly to limit population growth in Greenland.

https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-insists-us-still-an-ally-despite-ukraine-aid-cutoff/,"The United States remains an ally for Europe, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen insisted on Sunday, following Washington's decision to cut off aid to Ukraine. But the top EU official chose not to include the U.S. in a list of ""like-minded"" countries with which she said Europe could entertain deeper partnerships, instead name-checking Canada, Norway and Britain. In the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to halt all military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, the European Commission chief was pressed repeatedly by reporters on whether she considered America, as well as the Trump administration, to still be among the allies of European countries. ""My position is clear: The United States are an ally in the transatlantic alliance,"" von der Leyen told a press conference marking the first 100 days of her second term in office. The German politician also insisted that Europe's relationship with the U.S. was ""totally different"" from the one it has with China, brushing aside the need for ""de-risking"" with the United States. But von der Leyen, who is yet to meet Trump in person since he was sworn in on Jan. 20, did point to a number of problems in world affairs that can be linked to Trump's actions, without naming the U.S. president or his country. ""We see that sovereignty but also ironclad commitments are called into question,"" she said, adding that ""everything"" had become ""transactional."" She touted the EU's recent push to sign new trade deals with third countries, including the Mercosur bloc in South America, as signaling openness and praised Europe's ""predictability."" ""We have learned the very hard way that sourcing products we need from partners we trust is the best way to avoid over-dependencies or to avoid vulnerabilities and blackmail,"" she said. Indeed, the EU has been forced to wean itself mostly off Russian gas following years of dependency via the now-destroyed Nord Stream II pipeline. European countries that have bought billions of euros worth of American weaponry now face questions about how dependable those arms are given the U.S. decision to limit its weapons' capabilities in the midst of Ukraine's defensive war with Russia. Von der Leyen underscored the EU's new push to spend some €800 billion on its defense industry, saying that the share of military kit sourced from Europe would have to increase ""gradually."" Currently, the EU is heavily dependent on U.S.-made weapons. As von der Leyen was speaking in Brussels, Poland's foreign minister sent a tweet suggesting Warsaw could look for alternatives to Elon Musk's Starlink ""if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider."" Von der Leyen was asked if she planned to meet with Trump in the near future. ""I think we will have a personal meeting when the time is right and this is the state of play at the moment,"" she said.",Von der Leyen insists US still EU ‘ally’ despite Ukraine aid cutoff,Nicholas Vinocur,POLITICO,2025-03-09T11:11:24,2025-03-09T12:47:12,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-845315,"Defense Minister Israel Katz on Sunday confirmed reports that Israel intends to allow Syrian Druze and Circassians to work in the Israeli side of the Golan Heights. The unusual move of allowing foreign citizens of a hostile state, such as Syria, to work in Israel could have geopolitical ripples across the region and is a testament to how radically the Middle East has changed in just a few months. Assad regime was toppled by rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is led by Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, last December 7-8. Until then, the regime had abided by a 1974 ceasefire with Israel. Nevertheless, it was formally in a state of war with Israel, while it served as a critical link in the chain of smuggling Iranian weapons to Hezbollah. This also presented a direct threat to Israel from Iranian militias that might invade and from the Syrian military’s air force, long-range missiles, and chemical weapons. The Syrian Druze were a minority in the Assad era who mostly kept to themselves, with some past positive history with Israel, especially with the Israeli Druze community. But it still mostly considered Israel to be a hostile party. Sharaa changed all of that. His ascent to power sowed fear within Israel of a jihadist invasion and among Syrian Druze that they would be oppressed or attacked, even though he said he wants quiet within Syria and along its borders. Not trusting Sharaa due to his jihadist background, Israel moved quickly to create a buffer zone in southern Syria to prevent even the possibility of a new invasion; included in this zone were large segments of the Syrian Druze population. IDF in Syria Throughout the three months that IDF Division 210 has been in southern Syria, there have been efforts to build stronger relations with the Syrian Druze to keep them calm about Israel’s presence there and to avoid friction. Katz’s move, even though it is restricted to the Golan, is a major step in seeking to deepen relations between Israel and that community. It is also a sign that Israel plans to remain in southern Syria for an extended period. The timing of the announcement follows internal tensions within Syria that turned into deadly clashes with about 1,000 casualties. The top commander of a Syrian Kurdish armed group, whose forces are in a separate battle with Turkey, blamed Turkish-backed Islamist factions for some of the most disturbing violence, including the reported executions of civilians belonging to Assad’s Alawite sect. Sharaa’s office said it was forming an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings by both sides. The clashes have pitted Assad loyalists against the country’s new Islamist rulers. The violence has led much of the West to question whether the new Syrian regime can be trusted and integrated into the Western economic system. Technically, there is no clear basis in international law for Israel to remain in Syria indefinitely or for Israel’s argument that its presence in Syria benefits the local Syrians and justifies the legitimacy of the IDF’s continued presence there. Katz credited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich with facilitating the move. Israel would protect the Syrian Druze community from threats by the new regime, he said.

https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pledges-to-resurrect-shipbuilding-as-china-seen-outpacing-us-/8004070.html,"When President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he had created a new White House office to ""resurrect"" American military and commercial shipbuilding, he elevated long-standing calls to fix the struggling industry that he said is vital to national security. His clarion call to build more ships ""very fast and very soon"" comes at a time of rising strategic competition with China. ""Our shipbuilding industry is shrunk down to bare minimum right now,"" Marine Corps Commandant General Eric Smith told VOA in an exclusive interview at the Pentagon late last year. The anemic state of American shipbuilding and ship maintenance, and the risks they raise for the military, was shared with VOA through more than a dozen interviews with U.S. military and industry officials spanning several months and conducted ahead of Trump's announcement. The U.S. Navy is still considered the most powerful in the world when it comes to firepower and tonnage, but the number of Navy ships has fallen behind China’s. The United States has 296 ships in its fleet, while China’s is on pace to surpass 400 ships this year. Shrinking fleet Despite the U.S. Navy’s goal of increasing the size of its fleet, in recent years the number of ships has been shrinking. Last year’s budget funded just six new Navy ships, while decommissioning 15 from the fleet, for a net loss of nine. The fiscal 2025 budget plan funds six new ships while decommissioning 19, for a net loss of 13. The lifeblood for maritime industry titans like British-based BAE, U.S.-based Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) and Fairbanks Morse Defense runs almost exclusively through the U.S. military. Industry leaders say they have the space to build and repair more ships but that Navy contracts have been scarce. ""We’re operating at about half-capacity,"" said Brad Moyer, vice president of BAE Systems Ship Repair. Although the company is one of the largest for ship repair in the United States, when VOA toured BAE’s Norfolk yard in Virginia in November, most of the docking spaces for ships were empty. Shipbuilding demand has fluctuated wildly based on Navy budgeting strategies, creating an industry atmosphere of feast or famine that is shrinking the supply chain. ""There's thousands and thousands of suppliers that have gone out of business, and it's a real risk,"" George Whittier, the CEO of Fairbanks Morse Defense, told VOA. The company is the largest engine manufacturer in North and South America and the sole U.S. company supplying the biggest engines used in the military’s amphibious warfare ships. Each engine is about the size of a small school bus. ""We should have two engine suppliers. But the reality is, if the Navy is only going to build six ships a year, it's a struggle to keep one engine supplier in business, let alone two. We're going to have to grow our way out of this, and that’s the only way we're going to do it,"" Whittier said. He is not alone. VOA found multiple examples of companies that were the only supplier of specific ship parts. The U.S. military and other industry leaders say they are worried there will not be a backup for parts should more industry businesses go under. And those suppliers who have survived say when business is not steady, it takes longer to provide the parts, and it costs more to procure the materials. Acting Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jim Kilby, while advocating for a bigger fleet, says he has not had the budget to replace all of his aging ships and submarines, much less grow the force. ""When we get a new ship, we'll replace an old ship, because that old ship is more expensive and harder to maintain,"" he said in a recent interview. Maintenance delays, layoffs Military contracting delays and project cancellations have led to layoffs. Even though BAE is one the largest companies in the industry, its West Coast shipyard laid off nearly 300 employees in 2023 due to a shortage of work. In the city of Norfolk, on America’s East Coast, the number of Navy ships available for repair work dropped from 44 ships about a decade ago to fewer than 30 today. About 60% of the workforce was furloughed in that time, officials said. The result, General Smith says, is a hollowed-out workforce that is not centered on shipbuilding. ""There's no one who grew up as a shipbuilder. There's welders and steam fitters and electricians, but if there's not steady work for them, they'll go to work for Harley-Davidson or Ford Motor Company or Chevy or whoever,"" he said. Whittier and Moyer blame the budgeting process in Congress, along with the way the Navy structures its ship maintenance. ""The system is broken,"" Whittier says. Congress has not passed a budget on time since 2019. When continuing resolutions (CRs) are used to fund the government, new projects cannot be started. In the case of the fiscal 2024 budget, Congress funded government with CRs for half a year, which Whittier says gave companies six months to do 12 months of work. ""It ends up being not just a big challenge in how to run a company, but it's a big challenge for the Navy in trying to figure out how are they getting their maintenance done. … It's frustrating all around for everybody,"" the Fairbanks Morse Defense CEO told VOA. Senator Mark Kelly, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, agrees that CRs are bad, adding that the only thing worse would be shutting down the government. ""People are always going to try to blame somebody else, but I’d just say collectively, we’ve taken our eye off the ball here,"" he added. Shipbuilding struggles There is also a shortage of skilled workers needed to keep the shipbuilding industry afloat. Huntington Ingalls Industries’ shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, along the coast of the Gulf of America is the only yard in the United States that builds the Navy’s two types of amphibious warfare ships: Landing Helicopter Assault ships (LHAs) that look like mini-aircraft carriers, and smaller landing platform docks (LPDs). HII also builds Navy destroyers and Coast Guard cutters. Kari Wilkinson, executive vice president at HII, says that keeping staffing levels around the more than 11,000 workers needed to build cutters, destroyers and amphibious ships is getting more difficult, particularly in the post-pandemic economy. Just a few years ago, the shipyard was able to offer wages much higher than other jobs in the area that do not require a college degree. Now, Wilkinson says they are competing with everyone from coffee providers to fast food restaurants. ""The wage circumstance has changed. There is not that big gap anymore,"" she told VOA. As a result, Wilkinson says, HII now loses workers at roughly double the rate of its pre-pandemic levels. To save money on materials, Congress authorized the military to buy four amphibs from HII at once, a move known as a multi-ship block buy. Buying them in bulk saved the Pentagon $900 million. ""That was a huge win for us,"" General Smith said. Now, HII must figure out how to better retain its workforce. To make the worksite more attractive, HII has invested in air conditioning and giant shades to shield workers from the elements like the hot Mississippi sun. The Pascagoula shipyard hired 7,000 people in the last two years, Wilkinson says, but it will need about 1,000-2,000 more hires each year to complete the new ship orders. ""We've got to find ways to pay people competitive wages that are in accordance with the type of work they're doing,"" Kelly told VOA. Commercial shipping Congress is expected to increase the military’s budget to surge resources for its shipbuilding shortfalls. But Kelly tells VOA that U.S. commercial shipping is also in need of saving. ""We went from 10,000 ships during World War II to 85 today. So, in case of an emergency, in case of a conflict with a near peer adversary, we're quite limited to getting all those supplies and equipment and troops across the ocean,"" he said. The United States builds about five commercial ships each year. China builds more than 1,000. ""They have one shipyard, just one shipyard, that's bigger than all of our shipyards put together,"" the senator told VOA. Kelly in December introduced bipartisan legislation called the Ships for America Act. The bill aims to increase the U.S. commercial fleet by 250 ships in 10 years, which will also increase the supply chain for military ships. ""You wouldn’t really think those two things are connected. But they are very closely connected,"" he said. ""A lot of the parts that go into a U.S. aircraft carrier, some of those same parts for those systems go in merchant ships.","China far outpacing US in military, commercial ship numbers",Carla Babb,Voice of America (VOA News),2025-03-09T07:35:15,2025-03-12T17:01:56,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/trump-deportations-migrants-panama-costa-rica-darien-rights-afghanistan-70f79684ac9e0701bc34e3e7144944c5,"PANAMA CITY (AP) — After weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism, Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after being deported from the United States, telling them they have 30 days to leave the Central American nation. It thrust many like Hayatullah Omagh, a 29-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban took control, into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward. “We are refugees. We do not have money. We cannot pay for a hotel in Panama City, we do not have relatives,” Omagh told the Associated Press in an interview. “I can’t go back to Afghanistan under any circumstances ... It is under the control of the Taliban, and they want to kill me. How can I go back?” Authorities have said deportees will have the option of extending their stay by 60 days if they need it, but after that many like Omagh don’t know what they will do. Omagh climbed off a bus in Panama City alongside 65 migrants from China, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal and other nations after spending weeks detained in poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration “to send a signal of deterrence” to people hoping to migrate. Human rights groups and lawyers advocating for the migrants were waiting at the bus terminal, and scrambled to find the released migrants shelter and other resources. Dozens of other people remained in the camp. Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border, but not allowed to make an asylum claim. “Once I get off the bus, I’ll be sleeping on the ground tonight,” Gaponov said. Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S. The deportees, largely from Asian countries, were part of a deal stuck between the Trump administration and Panama and Costa Rica as the U.S. government attempts to speed up deportations. The administration sent hundreds of people, many families with children, to the two Central American countries as a stopover while authorities organize a way to send them back to their countries of origin. Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process. The agreement fueled human rights concerns when hundreds of deportees detained in a hotel in Panama City held up notes to their windows pleading for help and saying they were scared to return to their own countries. Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution. Those that refused to return home were later sent to a remote camp near Panama’s border with Colombia, where they spent weeks in poor conditions, were stripped of their phones, unable to access legal council and were not told where they were going next. Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into “black holes” for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism. Upon being released Saturday night, human rights lawyers identified at least three people who required medical attention. One has been vomiting for over a week, another deportee had diabetes and hadn’t had access to insulin in the camp and another person had HIV and also didn’t have access to medicine in detention. Those who were released, like Omagh, said they could not return home. As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban — which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country — would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas. Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied. “My hope was freedom. Just freedom,” he said. “They didn’t give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me ‘No, no, no, no, no.’” Still, he said that leaving the camp was a relief. Omagh and other migrants who spoke to the AP detailed scarce food, sweltering heat with little relief and aggressive Panamanian authorities. In one case, Omagh and others said, a Chinese man went on a week-long hunger strike. In another, a small riot broke out because guards refused to give a migrant their phone. The riot, they said, was suppressed by armed guards. Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and cancelled a planned press visit last week. While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn’t want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help. Omagh said he was told in the camp he could be sent to a third country if it gives people from Afghanistan visas. He said that would be incredibly difficult because few nations open their doors to people with a Afghan passport. “None of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,” said Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama’s deputy foreign minister, in an interview with the AP last month. That was the case for some, like one Chinese woman who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions from Panamanian authorities. Upon getting off the bus, the first thing she wanted to do was find a Coca-Cola. Then, she’d find a way back to the U.S. “I still want to continue to go to the United States and fulfill my American dream,” she said. ___ Janetsky reported from Mexico City.",Panama releases dozens of detained deportees from US,"MEGAN JANETSKY, Alma Solís, MATÍAS DELACROIX",AP News,2025-03-09T04:53:39,2025-03-09T12:53:20,gemini-2.0-flash

https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2025/03/09/erdogan-ally-warns-of-pkk-affiliated-groups-must-disarm-as-well,"A key ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday that all “affiliated groups” of the Kurdish militant group PKK must disarm as well, as part of a historic ceasefire deal with Ankara. Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), had last month called on his group to disband and end more than four decades of armed struggle against Turkey. For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app. But Ankara also wants all PKK fighters disarmed wherever they are, notably those in the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the bulk of which is made up of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG). The SDF leadership welcomed Ocalan’s call on February 27 to disband, but said it did not apply to its forces. “The PKK terrorist organization and its affiliated groups must immediately and without preconditions lay down their weapons,” said Devlet Bahceli, head of the hardline nationalist MHP party. Bahceli is considered the key sponsor of the talks between Ankara and PKK, after he offered a surprise peace gesture if Ocalan rejected violence. “The fact that the YPG and other similar terrorist groups claim to be exempt from this call ... is completely contradictory to the leadership of the organization,” Bahceli said in a statement. The PKK announced a ceasefire after the call by Ocalan, who has been imprisoned for the past 26 years, saying that “none of our forces will carry out any armed operation unless they are attacked.” Since 2016, Turkey has carried out three major military operations in northern Syria, targeting PKK militants, which it sees as a strategic threat along its southern border. The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU, has waged an insurgency since 1984. Its original aim was to carve out a homeland for Kurds, who make up about 20 percent of Turkey’s 85 million people. Since Ocalan's incarceration in 1999, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed that has left more than 40,000 dead.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gx52xqqpo,"Three Bulgarian nationals have been found guilty of spying for Russia, in what police have described as ""one of the largest"" foreign intelligence operations in the UK. Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, who were all living in London, were part of a group who travelled Europe carrying out surveillance on journalists, a former politician and a US military base in Germany between 2020 and 2023. While the trio had day jobs as a beautician, a healthcare worker, and a decorator, the cell they were part of plotted to kidnap and kill targets, as well as planned to ensnare them in so-called honeytraps. The methods they used were the sort of thing you would ""expect to see in a spy novel"", said the Metropolitan Police's Cdr Dominic Murphy. How spy ring living double lives did Kremlin's dirty work Gaberova, of Euston, north London, Ivanova, of Harrow, north London, and Ivanchev, of Acton, west London, were convicted of conspiracy to spy, while Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents. They were working for fellow Bulgarian Orlin Roussev, 47, who ran the spy ring from a 33-room former guest house in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Here police found a ""treasure trove"" of spying gadgets and equipment, including cameras hidden in ties, a camera hidden in a fake rock, and glasses containing recording equipment. They also found a number of Minions cuddly toys, including one which contained a spy camera. Roussev had referred to those working for him as his ""minions"", like the yellow sidekicks of dastardly villain Gru in the Despicable Me children's film franchise. Roussev previously admitted conspiracy to spy, alongside Biser Dzhambazov, 43, of Harrow, while a sixth defendant, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, of Greenford, west London, admitted spying before the trial. The cell's key targets were investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov, whose work includes exposing Russia's role in the nerve agent attacks on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018. As part of the surveillance, Gaberova was instructed to befriend Mr Grozev, with Roussev describing him as ""hooked and in love"" with her in WhatsApp messages. Another operation included carrying out surveillance to identify Ukrainian soldiers at a military site where they were being trained, around the time of Russia's invasion of the country in 2022. During the trial, prosecutor Alison Morgan KC said the spy cell was ""sophisticated in their methodology; carrying out surveillance activity of individuals and places; manufacturing and using false identities and deploying advanced technology to acquire information"". The police investigation received 221 mobile phones, 495 sim cards, 11 drones, and devices allowing data to be extracted from phones and eavesdropping on wi-fi activity. Met counter-terrorism chief Cdr Murphy said the case was an ""extremely sophisticated"" operation that ""posed a threat to national security and individuals"". Roussev received instructions from Jan Marsalek, who is wanted in Germany for his alleged fraud linked to the financial services company Wirecard. The Austrian national was described by prosecutors as an ""intermediary for the Russian intelligence services"". Roussev and Marsalek met a decade ago, with Roussev subsequently recruited as a spy. He then recruited other Bulgarians to undertake espionage operations. Orlin Roussev was arrested by police in a guesthouse in Great Yarmouth. Roussev was at one stage the chief technology officer for a city of London financial firm. Stoyanov worked as a medical courier, but also fought in mixed martial arts fights using the nickname ""The Destroyer"". Dzhambazov and Ivanova lived together as a couple and worked in healthcare jobs, but also ran a Bulgarian community organisation that provided courses on ""British values"". But Dzhambazov was also in a relationship with Gaberova – they were found in bed together when police made arrests – and Ivanchev had separately been in a relationship with her in the past. During their trial, Ivanova and Gaberova admitted undertaking surveillance operations but denied knowing it was for the benefit of Russia. Ivanchev did not give evidence during the trial but outlined a similar position during police interviews after being arrested. He was arrested a year after the other five defendants and told police he had several conversations with MI5. The prosecution case focused on six operations carried out by the spies: Operation 1 This targeted the Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev. Marsalek and Roussev exchanged messages discussing their options in relation to Mr Grozev, including the placing of team members in seats next to him on planes. He was followed throughout Europe and properties connected to him were watched in Austria and Bulgaria. The spy cell also discussed potentially robbing him of his laptop and phone and taking it to the Russian Embassy, burning his property, kidnapping him and taking him to Moscow, or killing him. Operation 2 This targeted journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, a Russian national. The cell followed him in various countries, and discussed kidnapping him in the UK and smuggling him out of the country using a small boat. At one stage, Ivanova was so close to him on a plane that she could see the Pin code for his phone. Operation 3 This targeted a man called Bergey Ryskaliyev in November 2021, the court heard. Mr Ryskaliyev is a Kazakhstan national and former politician. He fled to the United Kingdom where he was later granted asylum. There is and was a clear motive for Russia to develop relations with Kazakhstan, the court heard. Prosecutors said that targeting a political dissident on behalf of Kazakhstan cultivates those relations by providing Kazakhstan with what it might consider to be assistance. Operation 4 This involved plans for disruptive activity at the Kazakh embassy in London in September 2022. The court heard that the plan was to stage a demonstration outside the embassy - a ""fake protest"" - to create a pretence that they were in possession of genuine intelligence about those responsible, which they would then pass on to the Kazakhstan intelligence to try to gain favour with Kazakhstan on behalf of Russia. Operation 5 This involved surveillance at the Patch Barracks, a US Military Base in Stuttgart in late 2022. This is a US military airbase, which jurors heard was believed by the defendants to be a location where Ukrainian forces were being trained in the use of surface to air weapons, at the very time of Russia's invasion into Ukraine. Prosecutors say the defendants' plan was to target the airbase using a range of highly sophisticated technology designed to capture key intelligence about those present on the base. Operation 6 Jurors were told this plan was targeting a man called Kirill Kachur. He is a Russian national who spent time in Montenegro who was employed by the Investigative Committee of Russia but left the country in 2021 and was designated as a ""foreign agent"" by Russia in November 2023.",Bulgarians guilty of spying for Russia in the UK,"Daniel De Simone, Amy Walker",BBC News,2025-03-07T14:48:02,2025-03-07T14:59:37,gemini-2.0-flash

https://abc7ny.com/post/suffolk-county-brush-fire-breaks-sunrise-highway-long-island/15993587/,"SUFFOLK COUNTY, Long Island (WABC) -- Massive, wind-whipped brush fires are raging across parts of Long Island's Pine Barrens region on Saturday, prompting a large emergency response to control the blazes that led to a local State of Emergency in the town of Southampton in Suffolk County. Flames from the brush fires started around 1 p.m. Saturday along Sunrise Highway and continued to burn into the evening. The Southampton Town Police Department said Sunrise Highway reopened just before 9:30 p.m. Saturday after the blaze forced roads to be shut down. Patty Lucci had been driving along Sunrise Highway and ventured into the woods because she is a retired police officer and was worried a car had veered off the road and caught fire. She realized minutes later what this really was. ""It's jumping trees at this point, and it's moving pretty fast,"" Lucci said, ""The winds were insane. It got to a point where I had to walk backwards away from the smoke coming towards me because I couldn't breathe."" Authories say the area involved stretched three miles long by one mile wide from Center Moriches towards Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach. It was on the South Side of Sunrise Highway as smoke crept perilously toward that airport -- ironically air national guardsmen who saw it were at the ready and were available to start fighting the fire with water from above. ""You never wanna see something like this happen, but it's really good that it did happen within sight of the National Guard because they reacted immediately,"" said Terence O'Leary of NYS Homeland Security and Emergency Services. Throughout the evening, brush trucks drove through the thick of it, putting water on the hot spots, which are hard to contain. The Westhampton fire was 80 percent contained as of Saturday evening as the Air National Guard conducts air drops to control the flames. One firefighter suffered a second-degree burn to his face. He was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital. Two commercial structures nearby were damaged. The combination of low relative humidity and northwest winds gusting 30 to 35 mph have created tinderbox condition across the Tri-State, the fires coming as the National Weather Service put out an alert for the elevated risk of fire spread on Saturday. ""With this wind, a spark will simply ignite it. This is something that we're gonna have to watch probably over the next few days,"" said Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine. Nearly one hundred different fire departments and EMS Units from Nassau and Suffolk Counties all pitched in to help, but at this point there was no loss of life. ""There are no residents at this time in the line of fire, but we are monitoring that very closely from the air and you will know by telephone, you will know by knocks on your door if that changes,"" said Southampton Police Chief James Kiernan. The Town of Southampton asked resident to refrain from any and all outdoor recreational fires during the next 24 hours due to high winds and the danger of wildfires. Hochul released a statement assuring that any resources needed would be dispatched to fight the fires. ""We are in close communication with local partners on Long Island to coordinate assistance and make sure they have the resources they need to protect their communities,"" Gov. Kathy Hochul said. In additional to the National Guard, Hochul said New York has dispatched ""personnel from the Office of Emergency Management, Office of Fire Prevention and Control, Department of Transportation, Department of Environmental Conservation, State Parks and the New York State Police to assist Suffolk County's response to this crisis."" ""Public safety is my top priority, and I'm committed to doing everything possible to keep Long Islanders safe,"" Hochul said in the statement. ---------- * More Long Island news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts * Follow us on YouTube  Submit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-trump-saudi-arabia-talks-kursk-battlefield-war/33341436.html,"Russian forces have carried out more than 2,100 aerial strikes on Ukraine over the past week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on March 9, as Russia has stepped up attacks on its neighbor and reported battlefield gains ahead of Kyiv's high-stakes talks with US representatives in Saudi Arabia. It comes as US President Donald Trump questioned the long-term viability of Ukraine itself. When asked in a Fox Business TV interview whether he was worried that decreased US support for Ukraine could endanger that country's survival, he responded: ""Well, it may not survive anyway."" ""But, you know, we have some weaknesses with Russia -- you know, it takes two,""Trump added. Zelenskyy said in a social media post that Russian forces this week deployed 1,200 guided aerial bombs, nearly 870 attack drones, and more than 80 missiles of various types. The Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, announced the recapture of several villages and towns on March 9 in its Kursk region -- as well as new settlements in eastern Ukraine -- with unconfirmed reports that thousands of Ukrainian troops risk being encircled by Russian forces. It comes a day after Russian air strikes killedat least 50 peoplein the eastern Donetsk region, according to local officials, with at least 11 deaths reported in the city of Dobropillya. ""Such strikes show that Russia's goals are unchanged,"" Zelenskyy wrote on social media late on March 8. ""Therefore, it is very important to continue to do everything to protect life, strengthen our air defense, and increase sanctions against Russia.” No media source currently available The series of strikes and battlefield pressure represent another setback for Kyiv ahead of crucial talks with the United States next week in Saudi Arabia, where Ukrainian officials will meet with their US counterparts for negotiations around how to end the three-year war. The Institute For The Study of War, a Washington-based think tank that tracks battlefield developments, said Russian forces have ""intensified their multidirectional campaign to eliminate the remaining Ukrainian salient in Kursk"" in the last two days. According to DeepState, an open-source military tracker linked to the Ukrainian Army, the Russian moves followed a ""breach"" in Ukrainian defense lines near the town of Sudzha, which remains under Kyiv's control but is facing growing pressure from Russian units. Pro-Russian war bloggers who closely track frontline developments in the war also reported that Russian special forces walked inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in Kursk late on March 8 to gain a foothold outside of Sudzha. According to the reports, the pipeline was used to surprise Ukrainian units and cut off their supply lines as the Kremlin pours more manpower into kicking Kyiv out of Russian territory. RFE was not able to independently verify the accounts, but Ukrainian officials confirmed that Russian ""sabotage and assault groups"" used the pipeline to get access to Sudzha. ""At present, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked, and destroyed. The enemy's losses in Sudzha are very high,"" Ukraine's General Staff said in a Telegram post on March 8. Ukraine aimed to hit back by launching a drone overnight at an industrial facility in the Russian region of Chuvashia, some 1,300 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The strike is one of the deepest yet into Russian territory by a Ukrainian drone, and it hit its target but caused no casualties, according to Russian authorities. Ousting Ukrainian forces from Kursk with the talks in Saudi Arabia approaching looks to be part of Moscow's strategy. In August 2024, thousands of Ukrainian soldiers seized roughly 1,300 square kilometers of Russia's western Kursk region, a move which Kyiv later characterized as an attempt to gain a bargaining chip for future negotiations and draw Russian troops away from the front line in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces have managed to claw back large chunks of territory in Kursk, but Ukraine has retained a foothold that now risks being shrunk down further leading into the key talks. With his attention fixed on the upcoming talks, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ""fully committed"" to having a constructive dialogue with US representatives in Saudi Arabia next week over a potential peace settlement. ""Ukraine has been seeking peace from the very first second of this war. Realistic proposals are on the table. The key is to move quickly and effectively,"" he posted on X.The Ukrainian president said he will travel to Saudi Arabia and meet with Saudi Prince Muhammad bin Salman on March 10. Afterward, a delegation of Ukrainian diplomatic and military representatives will stay for a March 11 meeting with a US negotiating team.

https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-china-trump-xi-trade-war-debaa669593271d79658bb8b9ce42572,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The leaders of both Canada and Mexico got on the phone with President Donald Trump this past week to seek solutions after he slapped tariffs on their countries, but China’s president appears unlikely to make a similar call soon. Beijing, which unlike America’s close partners and neighbors has been locked in a trade and tech war with the U.S. for years, is taking a different approach to Trump in his second term, making it clear that any negotiations should be conducted on equal footing. China’s leaders say they are open to talks, but they also made preparations for the higher U.S. tariffs, which have risen 20% since Trump took office seven weeks ago. Intent on not being caught off guard as they were during Trump’s first term, the Chinese were ready with retaliatory measures — imposing their own taxes this past week on key U.S. farm imports and more. “As Washington escalates the tariff, Beijing doesn’t see other options but to retaliate,” said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank. “It doesn’t mean Beijing doesn’t want to negotiate, but it cannot be seen as begging for talks or mercy.” As the world’s second-largest economy, China aspires to be a great power on both the regional and global stage, commanding respect from all countries, especially the United States, as proof that the Communist Party has made China prosperous and strong. After the U.S. this past week imposed another 10% tariff, on top of the 10% imposed on Feb. 4, the Chinese foreign ministry uttered its sharpest retort yet: “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.” The harsh rhetoric echoed similar comments in 2018, when Trump launched his first trade war with China and it scrambled to line up tit-for-tat actions. Beijing’s leaders have since developed a toolkit of tariffs, import curbs, export controls, sanctions, regulatory reviews and measures to limit companies from doing business in China. All are designed to inflict pain on the U.S. economy and businesses in response to the American measures. That allowed the Chinese government to react swiftly to Trump’s recent across-the-board doubling of new tariffs on Chinese goods by rolling out a basket of retaliatory measures, including taxing many American farm goods at up to 15%, suspending U.S. lumber imports and blacklisting 15 U.S. companies. Beijing showed restraint in its response to leave room for negotiation, analysts say. Xi Jinping’s leadership of the ruling Communist Party spans both of Trump’s terms, giving Beijing more continuity in its planning. He is the one who decided it’s not yet time to speak with Trump, said Daniel Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “That’s not a scheduling issue, it’s leverage for China,” said Russel, who previously served as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. “Xi won’t walk into a call if there’s a chance he’ll be harassed or humiliated and for both political and strategic reasons, Xi won’t play the role of a supplicant.” “Instead, China is hitting back promptly — but judiciously — to each set of tariffs,” Russel said. At his annual press conference Friday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that “no country should fantasize that it can suppress, contain China while developing good relations with China.” “Such two-faced acts not only are bad for the stability of bilateral relations but also will not build mutual trust,” Wang said. He added that China welcomes cooperation with the U.S., but noted that “if you keep pressuring, China will firmly retaliate.” Scott Kennedy, a trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Chinese this time are “not psychologically shocked” by Trump’s “shock-and-awe” tactics. “They’ve seen this before,” Kennedy said. “These are the kind of things that they’ve anticipated.” China’s economy has slowed but is still growing at nearly a 5% annual pace, and under Xi, the party is investing heavily in advanced technology, education and other areas. It has stronger trade ties with many other countries than during Trump’s first term and has diversified where it gets key products, for example, buying most of its soybeans from Brazil and Argentina instead of the U.S. In turn, the percentage of Chinese goods sold to the U.S. has fallen. “They are better prepared to absorb the effect of the shocks, compared to several years ago,” Kennedy said. Meanwhile, more than 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the U.S., and Canada sends 75% of its exports here. China has learned from its previous dealings with Trump, Russel said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum are facing a reversal of Trump’s previous trade policies, with tariffs imposed and then postponed twice on at least some goods. “Beijing has seen enough to know that appeasing Trump doesn’t work,” Russel said. In the first go-around, Trudeau and Sheinbaum “bought a little time, but the pressure only came roaring back stronger.” Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump in December after the president-elect threatened tariffs. But in announcing retaliatory tariffs Tuesday, Trudeau sternly warned: “This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.” Sheinbaum also has said that “no one wins with this decision.”",China learned from Trump's first trade war and changed its tactics when tariffs came again,Didi Tang,AP News,2025-03-09T05:03:00,2025-03-09T01:03:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.axios.com/2025/03/09/us-trump-israel-hamas-gaza-talks,"White House envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to travel to Doha on Tuesday evening in an effort to broker a new hostage-release and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, two U.S. officials said. Why it matters: The talks would be the first since President Trump took office and since the original agreement between Israel and Hamas that established a 42-day ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of 33 hostages in its first phase, which ended one week ago. Witkoff is expected to join Qatari and Egyptian mediators and negotiators from Israel and Hamas who will begin talks on Monday. The Trump administration is pushing for a deal that would lead to the release of all remaining hostages, extend the ceasefire until after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover and possibly lead to a long-term truce that would end the war. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces have confirmed 35 are dead. Israeli intelligence believes 22 are still alive and the status of two others is unknown. Among the remaining hostages are five Americans, including 21-year-old Edan Alexander who is believed to be alive. Driving the news: Axios reported earlier this week that Trump's envoy for hostage affairs Adam Boehler has been holding direct talks with Hamas officials. Their last meeting took place last Tuesday. During the talks, Boehler discussed the possible release of Alexander and the remains of four other American hostages as a way to launch a broader deal on the release of all remaining hostages and a long term truce. State of play: Witkoff is expected to travel to Doha after participating in a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. It is unclear if he is going to meet with Hamas officials or only with Israeli negotiators and Qatari and Egyptian mediators. A senior Israeli official said Witkoff wanted to get all the parties in one place for several days of intense negotiations in an effort to reach a deal. A Hamas delegation held talks in Cairo on Saturday with the director of the Egyptian intelligence service about the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.

Israel has so far refused to seriously discuss the second phase of the deal.

Israel has never publicly acknowledged that it possesses nuclear weapons, but is widely believed to have around 90 in its arsenal, according to an assessment from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in June 2024. “Hammadi underscored the need for the international community and its institutions to uphold their commitments under resolutions of the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, the IAEA, and the 1995 Review Conference of the NPT, which called on Israel to subject all its nuclear facilities to IAEA safeguards,” the Qatari statement says. The Qatari ambassador also appealed for “intensified international efforts” to bring Israel into the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear state,” the foreign ministry says, adding that “all Middle Eastern countries, except Israel, are parties to the NPT and have effective safeguard agreements with the Agency.”",Qatar calls to bring ‘all of Israel’s nuclear facilities’ under supervision of UN nuclear watchdog,ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-03-08T23:26:46,2025-03-08T23:26:46,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-845209,"Israel denied on Saturday claims by Hamas of “positive indicators” for launching talks over the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. The Hamas statement came after US officials held direct talks with the terrorist group in Doha on Tuesday about releasing more American hostages. Israeli officials were not enthusiastic about the talks. Meanwhile, demonstrators at a Tel Aviv rally are pressing the government to agree to the continuation of the deal that will allow all of the hostages to be returned. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday evening was holding a telephone situational assessment regarding negotiations on the deal. The security cabinet, which will convene on Sunday, is expected to approve the expansion of the voluntary exit option for Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to other countries through an authority that Defense Minister Israel Katz will establish. The decision to establish this authority follows US President DonaldTrump’sstatements on the need to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza for other countries. An Israeli official clarified: “The authority will be subject to international law.” The authority will include representatives from several ministries including Justice, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Finance, Transportation, and Strategic Affairs, as well as representatives from the IDF, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Shin Bet (Israel Security Service), the National Security Council, and the Israel Police. The authority will also be able to coordinate its operations with international organizations and other relevant parties. Until now, Israel has allowed Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip for other countries for medical treatment, for humanitarian reasons. The current goal is to enable the departure of Palestinians in much larger numbers. Katz announced on February 17 that he intends to establish an authority for the voluntary departure of Palestinians from Gaza, and the official approval that will be granted by the cabinet will allow the expansion of voluntary movement for Palestinians from the Strip. According to the proposal to be presented to the ministers, the authority “will facilitate the controlled movement of Palestinians within Israel for their exit to other countries, provide security and escort for their movement, establish a designated travel route and pedestrian checks at Gaza border crossings, and create infrastructure to allow land, sea, and air passage to destination countries.” Israel is preparing to facilitate the voluntary movement of Palestinians from Gaza to another country via the Ashdod Port and Ramon Airport. Some even claim that once this option is made available, “thousands of Palestinians will leave Gaza every day.” Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich toldThe Jerusalem Postthat the “US is working intensely to find other countries that will agree to take in Palestinians from Gaza.”",Hamas claims 'positive indicators' for new ceasefire talks with Israel,"JERUSALEM POST STAFF, Amichai Stein",The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-08T12:34:00,2025-03-08T21:17:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-845221,"Iran has said it prefers a one-state solution to the conflict in Gaza rather than a recent plan put forward by Arab states after a meeting in Cairo last week. Tehran expressed this view at an Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference, where foreign ministers of various Muslim countries had gathered. This is a pivotal time in the region. The ceasefire in Gaza is still holding, Hamas has rejected Israel’s attempts to extend the first phase of a hostage deal, US President Donald Trump’s administration has engaged in direct talks with the terror group, and the Islamic Republic and the Arab states oppose his plan for re-settling Gazans. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said at the OIC that thetwo-state solution “will not secure Palestinian rights, emphasizing Tehran’s support for the establishment of one state representing all the original inhabitants of Palestine.” He said, “With due respect to the views of some brotherly countries on the two-state solution, the Islamic Republic of Iran maintains its view that this solution will not lead to the realization of the rights of the Palestinian people.” Iran has lost some of its influence in the Middle East after the fall of the Assad regime and the weakening of its proxies throughout the Middle East. It is now trying to claw this power back. “In our view, ‘one democratic state’ representing all the original inhabitants of Palestine is the only viable solution,” the Iranian foreign minister said. “Given the Israeli regime’s persistent defiance of the UN Charter, its designation of the UN secretary-general as persona non grata, the complete obstruction of UNRWA’s operations, and the unprecedented tragic loss of hundreds of UN staff in Palestine, it is imperative to continue our endeavors for Israeli regime’s expulsion from the United Nations,” Iran said at the OIC. The country’s state media published the foreign minister’s entire speech, indicating its importance in their eyes. Tehran says it has “uncompromising support” for the “cause of Palestine.” “While the Islamic Republic of Iran supports the present resolution, and without prejudice to the foregoing, it would like to put on record the following reservations on the content of the outcome of this meeting, details of which will be communicated later with the secretariat [of the OIC],” the Iranians’ said. Iran says it doesn’t want the OIC to be construed as recognizing the “Zionist regime.” Its foreign minister went on to say that the country “earnestly hopes that this auspicious meeting will inspire the international community to take meaningful action to advance justice and peace for the people of Palestine. May this gathering be a renewed commitment to their honorable cause.” Iran is thus trying to claw back some role in the Islamic world. It is obviously concerned that the Saudi Arabian and Egyptian proposal at the Arab League for Gaza could end with moderation or the replacement of Hamas. Iran would thus lose out in Gaza as well.","Iran seeks greater Islamic role, rejects Arab-led postwar Gaza efforts",SETH J.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/irans-khamenei-says-tehran-will-not-negotiate-under-us-bully-pressure/,"Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that Tehran will not be bullied into negotiations, a day after US President Donald Trump said he had sent a letter to the country’s top authority to negotiate a nuclear deal. In a meeting with senior Iranian officials Saturday, Khamenei said the aim of Washington’s offer for negotiations was to “impose their own expectations,” Iranian state media reported. “The insistence of some bully governments on negotiations is not to resolve issues, but to dominate and impose their own expectations,” he said. “Talks for them is a path to have new expectations, it is not only about Iran’s nuclear issue. Iran will definitely not accept their expectations.” In an interview with Fox Business Friday, Trump said, “There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal,” to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Trump said that while he would “rather negotiate a deal with Iran” to resolve the issue of its nuclear weapons program, “the other alternative is you have to do something, because Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.” There will be “some interesting days ahead with Iran,” Trump said. “We are down to the final moments. We can’t let them have a nuclear weapon. Something is going to happen very soon,” Trump said. “I would rather have a peace deal than the other option, but the other option will solve the problem.” In response to Khamenei’s comments, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes reiterated almost word for word the choice of negotiations or military action that Trump said he had presented to Iran. “We hope the Iran Regime puts its people and best interests ahead of terror,” Hughes said in a statement. While expressing an openness to a deal with Tehran, Trump has reinstated a “maximum pressure” campaign that was applied during his first term to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports to zero. During his first 2017-2021 term as president, Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark deal between Iran and major powers that placed strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. After Trump pulled out in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, Iran breached and far surpassed those limits. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has said time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on Iran’s activities, as Tehran continues to accelerate its enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade. Tehran insists its nuclear work is solely for peaceful purposes. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told AFP on Friday that the country’s nuclear program cannot be destroyed in a military attack. “Iran’s nuclear program cannot be destroyed through military operations… this is a technology that we have achieved, and the technology is in the brains and cannot be bombed,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation meeting in Jeddah. He also said an Israeli attack on Iran would set off a wider conflict in the Middle East. “I believe that if an attack on Iran were to take place, this attack could turn into a widespread fire in the region,” Araqchi added. Meanwhile, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani warned that an attack on Iran’s Gulf coast nuclear facilities would leave countries across the region without water. In an interview with right-wing United States media personality Tucker Carlson, who is close to Trump, the premier said Doha had simulated the effects of an attack. The sea would be “entirely contaminated,” and Qatar would “run out of water in three days,” he said. “No water, no fish, nothing… no life,” Sheikh Mohammed added. Qatar, which sits 190 kilometers (120 miles) south of Iran, relies heavily on desalination for its water supply, as do other Gulf Arab countries in the arid desert region. Iran has a nuclear power plant at Bushehr on the Gulf coast, though its uranium enrichment facilities, key to building atomic weapons, are located hundreds of kilometers inland.",Iran’s Khamenei says Tehran will not negotiate under US ‘bully’ pressure,Agencies,The Times of Israel,2025-03-08T17:37:29,2025-03-08T21:57:09,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/syria-alawites-sectarian-killings-coast-assad-hts-610cdee1d5762d3ecb75c700fb7cf5f2,"BEIRUT (AP) — The death toll from two days of clashes between Syrian security forces and loyalists of ousted President Bashar Assad and revenge killings that followed has risen to more than 1,000, a war monitoring group said Saturday, making it one of the deadliest acts of violence since Syria’s conflict began 14 years ago. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in addition to 745 civilians killed, mostly in shootings from close distance, 125 government security force members and 148 militants with armed groups affiliated with Assad were killed. It added that electricity and drinking water were cut off in large areas around the city of Latakia. The clashes, which erupted Thursday, marked a major escalation in the challenge to the new government in Damascus, three months after insurgents took authority after removing Assad from power. The government has said that they were responding to attacks from remnants of Assad’s forces and blamed “individual actions” for the rampant violence. The revenge killings that started Friday by Sunni Muslim gunmen loyal to the government against members of Assad’s minority Alawite sect are a major blow to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the faction that led the overthrow of the former government. Alawites made up a large part of Assad’s support base for decades. Residents of Alawite villages and towns spoke to The Associated Press about killings during which gunmen shot Alawites, the majority of them men, in the streets or at the gates of their homes. Many homes of Alawites were looted and then set on fire in different areas, two residents of Syria’s coastal region told the AP from their hideouts. They asked that their names not be made public out of fear of being killed by gunmen, adding that thousands of people have fled to nearby mountains for safety. Residents of Baniyas, one of the towns worst hit by the violence, said bodies were strewn on the streets or left unburied in homes and on the roofs of buildings, and nobody was able to collect them. One resident said that the gunmen prevented residents for hours from removing the bodies of five of their neighbors killed Friday at close range. Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of Baniyas who fled with his family and neighbors hours after the violence broke out Friday, said that at least 20 of his neighbors and colleagues in one neighborhood of Baniyas where Alawites lived, were killed, some of them in their shops, or in their homes. Sheha called the attacks “revenge killings” of the Alawite minority for the crimes committed by Assad’s government. Other residents said the gunmen included foreign fighters, and militants from neighboring villages and towns. “It was very very bad. Bodies were on the streets,” as he was fleeing, Sheha said, speaking by phone from nearly 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from the city. He said the gunmen were gathering less than 100 meters from his apartment building, firing randomly at homes and residents and in at least one incident he knows of, asked residents for their IDs to check their religion and their sect before killing them. He said the gunmen also burned some homes and stole cars and robbed homes. The Observatory’s chief Rami Abdurrahman said that revenge killings stopped early Saturday. “This was one of the biggest massacres during the Syrian conflict,” Abdurrahman said about the killings of Alawite civilians. The previous figure given by the group was more than 600 dead. No official figures have been released. A funeral was held Saturday afternoon for four Syrian security force members in the northwestern village of Al-Janoudiya after they were killed in the clashes along Syria’s coast. Scores of people attended the funeral. Syria’s state news agency quoted an unnamed Defense Ministry official as saying that government forces have regained control of much of the areas from Assad loyalists. It added that authorities have closed all roads leading to the coastal region “to prevent violations and gradually restore stability.” On Saturday morning, the bodies of 31 people killed in revenge attacks the day before in the central village of Tuwaym were laid to rest in a mass grave, residents said. Those killed included nine children and four women, the residents said, sending the AP photos of the bodies draped in white cloth as they were lined in the mass grave. Lebanese legislator Haidar Nasser, who holds one of the two seats allocated to the Alawite sect in parliament, said that people were fleeing from Syria for safety in Lebanon. He said he didn’t have exact numbers. Nasser said that many people were sheltering at the Russian air base in Hmeimim, Syria, adding that the international community should protect Alawites who are Syrian citizens loyal to their country. He said that since Assad’s fall, many Alawites were fired from their jobs and some former soldiers who reconciled with the new authorities were killed. Under Assad, Alawites held top posts in the army and security agencies. The new government has blamed his loyalists for attacks against the country’s new security forces over the past several weeks. France expressed “its deep concern” over recent violence in Syria. Paris “condemns in the strongest possible terms atrocities committed against civilians on the basis of religion grounds and against prisoners,” its foreign ministry said in a statement Saturday. France urged Syrian interim authorities to make sure independent investigations “shed full light on these crimes.” The most recent clashes started when government forces tried to detain a wanted person near the coastal city of Jableh, and were ambushed by Assad loyalists, according to the Observatory. ___ Omar Albam in Al-Janoudiya, Syria and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report.",Worst violence in Syria leaves more than 1000 people dead in two days,"Bassem Mroue, Sarah El Deeb",AP News,2025-03-08T14:47:48,2025-03-07T22:34:41,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.kyivpost.com/post/48474,"On the occupied territories of Ukraine, Russia has forcibly issued 3.5 million Russian passports to local residents, British Defence Intelligence reported Friday. According to the intelligence report, on March 4, Russian leader Vladimir Putin claimed that Russia had completed the issuance of passports to Ukrainians living in Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia. Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official. Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev reported that 3.5 million Russian passports had been issued to Ukrainians in occupied territories – an increase from the 2.8 million reported in March 2024. British intelligence also states that Russia coerces residents of occupied Ukrainian territories into obtaining Russian passports by tying them to essential services, including social benefits, healthcare, and financial transactions. Passport holders are also automatically subject to conscription into the Russian army. Those who refuse Russian citizenship face the risk of property confiscation. Russia has had a policy of forced passportization of Ukrainian citizens in occupied territories since it invaded Ukraine in 2014, a process that has only increased since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Mykhailo Savva, an expert at the Center for Civil Liberties, told Kyiv Post that this is a gross violation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Persons in Time of War. Andriy Yusov, a representative of Ukraine’s military intelligence (HUR), told Kyiv Post: “They are threatening to send them deeper [into Russia], and people are afraid that they will be sent to Siberia.” Yusov also said Russia uses deportations “for the illegal seizure of property of Ukrainians in the occupied territories.” He added: “The aggressor country is interested in mobilization resources, labor force and children.” Russian forces have set up a new 1,000-person filtration camp in which to process the residents of Ukrainian territories that Moscow occupied in 2024. The CNS report says that the population from these areas are being forcibly taken there to check for any cooperation with Ukraine’s defense forces, after which, once their loyalty is assured, they are compulsorily issued with Russian passports.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-issues-clip-of-hostage-matan-angrest-in-apparent-effort-to-rally-israelis-for-deal/,"Hamas on Friday published a video of hostage Matan Angrest begging to be set free, in an apparent effort by the terror group to mobilize Israeli public opinion in favor of continuing the ceasefire deal amid an impasse in negotiations. In the video, the 21-year-old captive IDF soldier, taken from a tank at Nahal Oz during battles there on October 7, 2023, says he has been held for 511 days, indicating it was likely filmed last week. Angrest, whose family approved the clip for publication, says he’s been told of the impasse in talks and feels that the Israeli government is deserting the hostages. “We’re starting to lose hope,” Angrest says, his voice emotionless throughout the video. He warns against a return to fighting by the IDF, saying doing so won’t secure freedom for the remaining 59 hostages. Angrest says the only way the hostages will go free is through a continuation of the phased deal to which the sides principally agreed in January. On Saturday, the first phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas drew to a close. Talks regarding terms of a poteantial second phase were supposed to have begun on February 3, but Israel has largely refused to engage in them, as phase two requires Israel to fully withdraw from Gaza and agree to a permanent end to the war in exchange for the remaining living hostages. Instead, it has sought to advance a new proposal for an extension of the first phase through Ramadan and Passover, which ends on April 19. At the beginning of the period, Hamas would release half of the remaining 59 hostages — 24 of whom are believed to be alive — while the second half would be released at the end of the ceasefire, if the sides agree to terms for a permanent end to the war. Hostage Matan Angrest is seen in a propaganda video published by Hamas on March 7, 2025. Reflecting on his conditions in captivity in the Hamas propaganda video, Angrest says he hasn’t seen sunlight and has sufferd from the winter cold. He adds that he’s been treated “like a soldier,” and not as a regular hostage, without offering details. Pleading to US President Donald Trump to secure his release, Angrest says, “You’re the only one who has the power to influence Netanyahu.” He tells his parents and three siblings that he knows they’re fighting for him and that he can’t wait to hug and see them again. Angrest closes by calling on the Israeli public to take to the streets in droves in order to protest for the release of the remaining hostages. In a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Angrest’s family said, “We are shaken by the video we just saw, in which we see our Matan looking drained and desperate after 518 days in Hamas’s tunnels.” A portrait of hostage Matan Angrest reads, ‘Wait for me to come back, tomorrow I’ll be home,’ painted by graffiti artist Benzi Brofman “Beyond the grave psychological state evident in the footage, his right hand is non-functional, his eyes and mouth are asymmetrical, and his nose is broken: according to testimonies from those who have returned, this is all due to interrogations and torture in captivity. What more proof is needed to understand that time has run out?” The family also appealed to Trump — the latest demonstration that hostages’ families believe the US president, not the Israeli prime minister, is the key to their loved ones’ release — urging him to “continue fighting for our Matan and all 58 other hostages with the same unwavering commitment and relentless determination. We must not stop until the deal is completed — only when the last hostage comes home.” On Monday the family had published the first photo of Angrest from captivity, from a previous video received from Hamas. That still photo joined an audio recording released several months back, in which Angrest begged Netanyahu to secure his release, in comments likely dictated by his captors. The family also lamented that although he was seriously wounded when abducted to Gaza, the soldier was not included in the “humanitarian” category of hostages released in the first stage of the ceasefire agreement, “because he’s an Israeli soldier.” Israel unveiled the offer to extend the ceasefire’s first stage a week ago, dubbing it the “Witkoff proposal” and saying it had been crafted by US special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff. Netanyahu’s office indicated it would be willing to hold talks on the terms of a permanent ceasefire in this framework, but the premier has long insisted that he will not accept anything other than Hamas’s complete surrender and exit from Gaza. Hamas has thus far rejected the “Witkoff proposal” — which the US envoy himself has yet to publicly endorse — insisting that it will only agree to release hostages through the framework that the sides inked in January. Meanwhile, the US began holding direct talks with Hamas in recent weeks aimed largely at securing the release of five American-Israeli hostages. Those negotiations have yet to bear fruit, leading US President Donald Trump to issue an ultimatum on Wednesday, demanding that the terror group immediately release all hostages or face destruction. Top Trump aides indicated that they expected movement toward their goal in the coming days. Trump issued the ultimatum shortly after meeting with a group of eight former hostages in the Oval Office. US President Donald Trump speaks from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on March 7, 2025. Reflecting on the experience on Friday, Trump told reporters he was surprised to learn from the released hostages he’d met that not a single one of their Hamas captors treated them with kindness. “I said, ‘Did you see anybody in there [who] was kind out of the hundreds of people that you were seeing [from] Hamas? Did some of them wink at you and say, ‘Don’t worry, you’re going to be okay, or give you a piece of bread?’ ‘No,’” Trump recalled. “I said, ‘Were there any people that were kind? I was shocked. The answer was nobody. There was nobody. Just the opposite. They’d be slapped and punched. One man broke his ribs. He couldn’t breathe for a month. It was brutal,” he said, appearing to reference the testimony of recently released hostage Eli Sharabi. “I was so surprised. Because you think there’d be a couple of people that would be kind, that would say, ‘You’re going to be okay.’ But they had none of that. It’s pretty amazing,” Trump said. Meanwhile on Friday, a group of more than 50 former Hamas hostages signed onto a letter to Netanyahu calling for Israel to continue with the ceasefire deal so the remaining captives in Gaza can return home.

(Hostages Families Forum) “We, who were kidnapped during the October 7 massacre, experienced on our flesh the hell from which our loved ones have yet to return. We saw the darkness, heard the horrors, breathed in the fear,” the freed hostages wrote. “We know, and are not [just] imagining, what the hostages left behind are going through. Brutal torture, humiliating hunger, sickness without treatment, abysmal loneliness — that is their reality in these moments. “Every minute there is hell, every additional moment is a potential death sentence.” The former captives urged the premier to prioritize the return of the hostages over a resumption of fighting, saying that since the weeklong truce deal in November 2023, “more hostages have been murdered than were rescued in military operations. “Israel was founded to defend the Jewish people, but on October 7, it failed,” they continued. “The only way to begin atoning for this resounding failure is to bring back all the hostages, the living for rehabilitation and the dead for a proper burial on Israeli soil.” “This may be the last chance,” the released hostages concluded.","Hamas issues clip of hostage Matan Angrest, in apparent effort to rally Israelis for deal",ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-03-07T22:56:45,2025-03-08T13:35:11,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nzyjgrwxo,"A measles outbreak in the American southwest has killed a second person, an unvaccinated adult, New Mexico health officials have said. The fatality comes roughly a week after measles took the life of an unvaccinated child in nearby Texas, the first US death from the disease since 2015. Measles, which was considered ""eliminated"" in the US in 2000, is spreading quickly in Texas, with the state identifying 198 cases as of Friday, nearly 30 more since the state's last report on Tuesday. In the same span the number of cases in neighbouring New Mexico tripled, to 30. The disease has also been reported in other states and across Canada, as well. The person who died in New Mexico was a resident of Lea County, about 50 miles (80km) from Gaines County, Texas, where the outbreak appears to be centred. Officials did not provide the person's sex or age. One in every five measles cases requires hospitalisation and about three in every 1,000 cases results in death, the New Mexico health department said on Thursday. The current outbreak killed a healthy but unvaccinated six-year-old in Texas, state officials said on 27 Feb. While the disease was declared eliminated 25 years ago, the US often sees outbreaks, which are defined as three or more related cases. Still, the two deaths are jarring to many in a country that, before last week, had not recorded anyone killed by measles since 2015. The 2015 death was the first one attributed to measles in the US since 2003. Three months into 2025, the total number of reported infections in the US has already climbed above 220. There were 285 cases over the entire year of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC has said it is monitoring the current outbreak, which is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community in Texas with low vaccination rates. While the outbreak is mostly occurring in Texas and New Mexico, measles has also recently been found in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington according to the CDC. Canada is also seeing a spike in infections, and recorded more cases in the first two months of this year than in all of 2024, the country's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said on Thursday. Measles has been found in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which Dr Tam attributed to travellers who were exposed to the disease in another country. As of Thursday, there were 227 measles cases reported this year in Canada and most of those who became ill were not vaccinated, according to the country's public health agency. The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and they also immunise people against mumps and rubella. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - who is known in part for being a vaccine sceptic - published an editorial on Sunday expressing his concern about the growing measles outbreak. ""Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinate due to medical reasons,"" he wrote in Fox News Op-Ed.",Second person dies in US measles outbreak ,Ana Faguy,BBC News,2025-03-07T12:37:59,2025-03-07T14:07:16,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/07/2003833047,"Taiwan has and would continue to improve its combat capabilities and procure military equipment based on its own national defense requirements, high-ranking government officials said today. The statements came in response to an article by Nikkei Asiathat said US President Donald Trump might pressure Taiwan into buying more weapons to make up for the trade imbalance between the two nations. Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country that has improved its combat capabilities based on its own national defense needs, not due to pressure from other countries, Premier Cho Jung-tai (åæ¦®æ³°) said. “If there is any [pressure], it is that we must strengthen ourselves to face the threat of China,” Cho said. Taiwan would consider how to enhance the combat capabilities of its military based on its need for self-reliant national defense, he said. It would also monitor the national financial situation while purchasing advanced military weaponry from other countries to upgrade its self-defense capabilities, he added. There are two types of peace: one is when we are strong enough and the other is if we surrender, Cho said. We choose to make Taiwan a stronger country, he said. The US has never purposefully sold Taiwan weapons that were not for defensive operations, but both sides have discussed what equipment is practical, Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo (é¡§ç«é) told reporters at the Legislative Yuan in Taipei. The government is procuring weapons to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait and to deter war through strength, which is a common interest with the US, Koo said. The approach is to increase defense spending by 3 percent of GDP based on defensive needs and the nation’s fiscal capacity, he said. Combat readiness preparations are not solely about procuring weapons, but also about operational and maintenance costs, Koo said. The Ministry of National Defense also goes through various channels to purchase domestically produced equipment, he said. Meanwhile, other senior military officials said that the troop strength of the nation's military was previously reviewed on a five-year basis. However, in the past few years the military has procured new equipment, established new units and reinstated the one-year mandatory service requirement, which means greater flexibility regarding deployments are needed, the officials said. Military strength reviews would be conducted annually through a “rolling assessment” approach, they said. The military has maintained a force of 215,000 troops for the past 10 years and this would be increased based on the annual reviews, they said. The number of officers has also been slightly increased from 292, but would be kept under 300, they added.","Military improvements decided by Taiwan alone, officials say","Chen Cheng-yu, Lo Tien-pin and Sam Garcia",台北時報,2025-03-07T00:00:00,2025-03-07T00:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/07/2003833013,"Investments by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, å	8f°ç©	8dé	9b») in the US should not be a cause for concern, but rather seen as the moment that the company and Taiwan stepped into the global spotlight, President William Lai (è³´æ¸	85å¾·) told a news conference at the Presidential Office in Taipei yesterday alongside TSMC chairman and chief executive officer C.C. Wei (é	ad	8få	93²å®¶). Wei and US President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday announced plans to invest US$100 billion in the US to build three advanced foundries, two packaging plants, and a research and development center, after Trump threatened to slap tariffs on chips made overseas. The plans are in addition to US$65 billion that TSMC has already committed to invest in three foundries in the US, one of which has begun operations. TSMC’s achievements have ensured that Taiwan is an integral part of the international community, Lai told the news conference. The company’s accomplishments are a testament to its ability and a source of fierce pride for all of Taiwan, he said. Because of TSMC’s investments, humanity’s technological future would be realized, Lai said, adding that this is “TSMC’s moment, Taiwan’s moment and a historic moment in Taiwan-US relations.” TSMC decided to invest in the US due to increased demand from US clients, Wei said. The facility operating in the US is fully booked through 2027, including production lines that are still under construction, he added. The new investment was not made due to US pressure, Wei said. Commenting on Trump’s call to abolish the CHIPS and Science Act, Wei said that TSMC asked only for fairness and was not afraid of competition. “We are the best wherever we set up our production lines,” he said. “We are not going for the subsidies.” The decision to increase investment in the US would not affect the company’s investment in Taiwan, where 11 production lines are expected to be completed this year, Wei added. Earlier yesterday, Premier Cho Jung-tai (å	8d	93æ¦®æ³°) said that TSMC would remain Taiwan’s “silicon shield,” as its research centers are still based in Taiwan, making concerns about its expansion to other markets irrelevant. The primary concern among Taiwanese is how the Monday announcement would affect TSMC’s investments or other projects in Taiwan, Cho said. The company’s investments abroad would not change the fact that its top research and development center, and its most advanced factories are in Taiwan, he said. The government has been in close talks with the industry and understands that Taiwan’s small and medium-sized enterprises are also seeking to expand internationally, he said. The government would collaborate with industrial sectors to help take Taiwanese products to the rest of the world and jointly build supply chains with democratic partners, he said, adding that the efforts would spread the nation’s influence. The more visible Taiwan is to the world, the safer the world is, Cho added. The president’s news conference with Wei was aimed at showing that “the government stands with industry,” dispelling attempts to cast doubt on the investment, a person with knowledge of the matter said. As TSMC has borne the brunt of recent cognitive warfare operations against Taiwan, the government and TSMC held close discussions prior to the announcement of the latest investment to formulate plans and held the news conference upon Wei’s return from the US to directly address the matter, the source said on condition of anonymity.

The CNPAV coalition – ""Le Congo n'est pas à vendre"" or ""Congo is not for sale""  – comprises of anti-corruption NGOs who claim the new terms are still heavily skewed in favour of Chinese companies, resulting in a $132 million (€124 million) loss for the DRC in 2024 alone. The group is urging the government to reopen negotiations to secure a fairer agreement. The so-called ""contract of the century"" was originally signed in 2008 under then-president Joseph Kabila, granting Chinese companies access to extensive copper and cobalt mines in exchange for infrastructure development. Renegotiated in early 2024, the agreement was meant to yield nearly $4 billion (€3.8 billion) in additional benefits for the Congolese. However, watchdogs argue that the new terms fail to rectify previous imbalances. Long road for DRC as it renegotiates minerals deal with China One of the primary concerns raised by CNPAV is the dependence of infrastructure funding on the fluctuating price of copper. Under the revised terms, the DRC is supposed to receive $324 million (€312 million) annually for road infrastructure over a 20-year period. However, these payments are only guaranteed if copper prices remain above $8,000 (€7,700) per tonne. If prices fall below this threshold, ""the state will receive less, or even nothing at all,"" warns the coalition.  Additionally, even if copper prices soar to $12,000 per tonne, the Congolese side will still receive the same $324 million, preventing the country from fully benefiting from market upswings. Eastern DR Congo grapples with Chinese gold mining firms A further criticism of the deal lies in its fixed payment structure, regardless of the volume of minerals extracted. Baby Matabishi, coordinator at theCarter Center-DRCand a member of CNPAV, highlighted the issue in an interview with RFI’s Kinshasa correspondent Pascal Mulegwa. ""Everything depends on the price of copper. There is this volatility and uncertainty of price, which doesn't necessarily guarantee that the $324 million is secured,"" Matabishi explained to RFI. The NGO also raises a key inconsistency: ""How can it be understood that a company that produces 100,000 tonnes of copper pays $324 million – and on the day it produces 200,000 tonnes or 400,000 tonnes – and then pays the same amount?"" Matabishi emphasised. Hence, the lack of a production-basedscaling mechanismmeans the DRC does not proportionally benefit from increased mining output. CNPAV has also condemned ongoing tax exemptions granted to Chinese companies, which cost the DRC at least $100 million annually. While the Kinshasa government argues that infrastructure development will offset any losses, civil society organisations claim that many promised projects remain incomplete or substandard.",DRC mineral contract with China slammed by NGOs citing 'major losses',RFI,RFI,2025-03-07T07:04:40,2025-03-07T07:04:40,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-845122,"New IDF Chief-Of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir has announced that R.-Adm. Daniel Hagari will no longer be the IDF’s chief spokesperson. Although his replacement has not yet been decided, one name that has circulated is Col. Beni Aharon, who commanded the 401st tanks brigade during the war in Gaza, with sources noting Zamir’s affinity for tank commanders like himself. Aharon has been in military academic studies since June 2024, so he is also readily available to enter a new position. It was widely presumed that Hagari would be replaced, not only because most new IDF chiefs prefer to install a close ally in the spokesperson’s position but also because he had publicly clashed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the coalition over the probe into some of the Israeli leader’s staff members for allegedly mishandling classified information relating to hostages held by Hamas, as well as regarding integrating haredim (ultra-Orthodox) into the army. The first IDF spokesperson to emerge from the navy, Hagari served as a top aide to former IDF chiefs Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot. He was also a commander at multiple levels of the elite Shayetet 13 naval commando unit, which meant his identity was kept secret for most of his career. Zamir replaced Lt.-Gen. (res.) Herzi Halevi as IDF chief of staff on Wednesday. Hagari is not the first chief spokesman to run into anger from the coalition. His predecessor, Brig.-Gen. Ran Kohav, was replaced by Halevi in January 2023, partially because elements of the Netanyahu government had turned their fire on him for sternly condemning an IDF soldier who illegally beat a left-wing activist in Hebron and for some other political controversies. Despite a court martial finding the soldier’s conduct to be clearly illegal, some politicians came to the soldier’s defense and blamed Kohav for the speed and intensity of the condemnation.","Daniel Hagari to be replaced as IDF spokesman, retire from military",YONAH JEREMY BOB,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-07T12:13:15,2025-03-08T22:29:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.dw.com/en/australia-orders-evacuations-as-cyclone-alfred-approaches/a-71853689,"Authorities in Australia have ordered thousands of people along
the country's eastern coast to evacuate due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred.

The cyclone has also caused rivers to swell and left some 80,000 homes in the states of Queensland and New South Wales without power.

Alfred, a Category 2 storm, was around 125 kilometers (80 miles) east of Brisbane on Friday afternoon and is expected to make landfall on Saturday, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said.

Residents told to 'prepare for the worst'

As Tropical Cyclone Alfred continues ""to move towards the coast, and rain and wind will intensify as we head into Friday night and Saturday,"" BOM meteorologist Jonathan How said.

While the slow-moving storm's progress has proven difficult to track, it is expected to hit land north of Brisbane, Australia's third most populous city.

Around 4 million people live along the 400-kilometer
(250-mile) stretch of coastline expected to be affected by the storm.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese urged residents in the region to ""hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.""

""When nature does its worst, Australians are at our best. We rally. We lift each other up. We look out for our neighbors,"" he told a press conference.

Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said dozens of evacuation centers had been opened ""as a last resort,"" warning that the storm already ""packed a punch"" and that conditions could worsen as the weather system approaches.

What has been the storm's impact so far?

The cyclone has brought heavy rains and high winds, flooding beaches and forcing airports in the densely populated region to close.

Public transport services in Brisbane have also been suspended, while over 1,000 schools in Queensland and New South Wales have been closed, education officials said Friday.


Flood warnings have been issued, as more than 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain have already been dumped in parts of New South Wales over the past two days.

While no deaths have been registered, one man has been reported missing after his car was swept from a bridge into a river, police in New South Wales said.

Although officials have urged residents to shelter or evacuate, Australian television images showed surfers taking advantage of the choppy seas amid wind gusts of over 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour.

""This isn't a time for sightseeing or for seeing what it's like to experience these conditions firsthand,"" Albanese said. ""Please stay safe. Be sensible.""

Cyclones are common in Australia's northwest and far northeast, it is rare that they hit so far south.

Climatologists have repeatedly warned that extreme weather events such as wildfires, floods and cyclones will become more regular and more intense because of climate crisis.

https://apnews.com/article/uganda-ebola-outbreak-14-cases-ab8a339eb2c0d482016b686c075b70ac,"KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Uganda’s Ebola caseload increased to 14 in the last week, Africa’s top public health agency said Thursday, with a new cluster emerging from a 4-year-old child who recently died of the infectious disease. Three of five new cases have been confirmed as Ebola, with two cited as probably Ebola, Dr. Ngashi Ngongo of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters. The Africa CDC reported that there was no direct epidemiological link between the new cluster and another one accounting for nine previous Ebola cases, including the first victim of the outbreak. Ebola is now spreading in five of Uganda’s 146 districts, it said. That includes Kampala, the capital, where the outbreak was declared on Jan. 30. Two Ebola deaths have been confirmed. Local health officials have not been giving regular updates on the outbreak, raising concerns about a lack of transparency. At least three hospitals in Kampala have handled confirmed or suspected Ebola cases without later informing the public of it. Dr. Charles Olaro, the director of health services in the Ministry of Health, told The Associated Press he believed the situation was under control. Officials were not required to give updates on every incident, he said. Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, and there are no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola that’s infecting people in Uganda. Ebola, which is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials, manifests as a deadly hemorrhagic fever. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. Scientists suspect the first person infected with Ebola in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat. Ugandan officials are still investigating the source of the latest outbreak. The first victim was a male nurse who died the day before the outbreak was declared. He had sought treatment at multiple facilities in Kampala and in eastern Uganda, where he also visited a traditional healer in trying to diagnose his illness, before later dying in Kampala. Uganda’s last outbreak, discovered in September 2022, killed at least 55 people before it was declared over in January 2023. Dr. Emmanuel Batiibwe, a hospital director who helped lead efforts to stop that outbreak, described the current one as “amorphous,” throwing up sporadic cases that require more serious surveillance to locate and isolate contacts. Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a trend of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease in January, and in December Rwanda announced its own outbreak of Marburg was over. Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks, including one in 2000 that killed hundreds. The 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 11,000 people, the disease’s largest death toll. Ebola was discovered in 1976 in simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.","Ebola cases in Uganda rise to 14 as new cluster emerges, posing a challenge to health workers",Rodney Muhumuza,AP News,2025-03-06T20:35:55,2025-03-06T16:35:55,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250307003300315?section=national/defense,"SEOUL, March 7 (Yonhap) -- The Air Force has grounded almost all of its aircraft after two of its fighter jets mistakenly bombed a village in a northern city earlier this week, an official said Friday. On Thursday, two KF-16 fighter jets ""abnormally"" released eight MK-82 bombs outside a training range in Pocheon, some 40 kilometers north of Seoul, during live-fire drills, leaving 15 people injured, according to military and rescue officials. As part of response measures, the Air Force has decided to impose flight restrictions on all of its aircraft, excluding those that conduct reconnaissance operations and others on emergency standby, according to the Air Force official. The flight restrictions are likely to remain until an internal investigation determines the cause of the accidental bombing, the official said, noting the results are not expected to take long. The move comes after Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Lee Young-su vowed Thursday to come up with preventative measures and require all pilots to undergo safety education as he apologized for the bombing. Pilot error is suspected to have caused the accidental bombing as one of the pilots of the jets entered the wrong target coordinates prior to takeoff, according to another Air Force official, citing an initial probe. The military has suspended all live-fire training until the exact cause of the accident is found. yunhwanchae@yna.co.kr(END)",Air Force grounds nearly all aircraft after accidental bombing of village,Chae Yun-hwan,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-07T10:14:31,2025-03-07T10:14:31,gemini-2.0-flash

President Donald Trump announced Monday the delay on tariffs against Mexico and Canada was over, and thus a 25% tax on most imports from the trade partners went into effect after midnight. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, said at a press conference Tuesday he would apply a 25% surcharge on energy exports to New York, Michigan and Minnesota and would consider restricting the electricity exports down the line if the tariffs persist. He repeatedly placed the blame solely at Trump's feet. ""A tariff on Canada is a tax on Americans,"" Ford said at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada convention Monday. ""I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I encourage every other province to do the same."" Ontario is Canada's second-largest energy producer, with most of its power coming from uranium. The province has interconnections with the provinces Manitoba and Quebec as well as three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota, and New York. Most of its imports come from Quebec and most of its exports go to New York and Michigan, according to the Canada Energy Regulator website. The tax would not begin immediately on Tuesday, a Ford representative told Bloomberg. What the Trump administration means for your wallet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter. Canada and the U.S. have enjoyed a mostly tariff-free relationship for decades. While most imports from Canada are now taxed at 25%, energy is taxed at 10%. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday Canada would respond with 25% tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of U.S. imports, effective immediately. That will escalate to another $86.2 billion worth of imports if Trump's tariffs are still in effect in three weeks. Ford said he supported Trudeau's tariffs Tuesday. He also announced he was removing American alcohol products from distribution and had canceled Ontario's contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet service Starlink.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250306003259315?section=national/defense,"SEOUL, March 6 (Yonhap) -- Fifteen people were injured Thursday after two Air Force KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly dropped eight air-to-surface bombs outside a training range during live-fire drills, military officials and fire authorities said, in an unprecedented mistaken bombing on a civilian town. Authorities said the bombing took place over a village in Pocheon, some 40 kilometers north of Seoul, at around 10 a.m., leaving 15 people, including two soldiers and two foreigners, with minor to serious injuries and damaging a church and seven other buildings. Fire authorities said two civilian men have been seriously injured and taken to the hospital but noted their injuries to the face and shoulder are not life-threatening. Eight others with minor injuries have also been moved to hospitals for treatment. Authorities expect the number of those injured to rise as more people have requested treatment. Members of some 40 housesholds in the area have evacuated to a town hall away from the bombing site. Military officials said the KF-16 fighter jets taking part in a live-fire exercise ""abnormally"" released four MK-82 bombs each outside the training range in Pocheon at 10:04 a.m. Pilot error is suspected to have caused the accident, an initial investigation showed, with one of the pilots of the single-seat jets wrongly entering the coordinates for the strike target prior to take-off. The Air Force said it is conducting an investigation into the accident, headed by Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Park Ki-wan, and apologized for the damage to civilians. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Lee Young-su vowed to make the utmost effort to compensate for the damage and bolster safety education and relevant procedures. ""We will compensate to the full extent of the mental, physical and property damage inflicted upon the residents,"" Lee said in a statement, saying he feels a heavy responsibility for causing concern. It marked the first accidental bombing by South Korean fighter jets that resulted in casualties. In 2004, an Air Force F-5B mistakenly released a practice bomb over Boryeong, 138 kilometers south of Seoul, but no one was injured from the incident. Earlier in the day, South Korea and the United States held combined live-fire drills near the inter-Korean border, in a show of firepower against North Korean military threats ahead of their annual springtime Freedom Shield exercise this month. The exercise took place at the Seungjin Fire Training Field in Pocheon, just 25 kilometers south of the border, mobilizing more than 160 pieces of military hardware, including K2 tanks, K55A1 self-propelled howitzers, Apache attack helicopters and F-35A stealth jets, according to the Army. A defense ministry official said the military will suspend all live-fire drills until the exact cause of the accident is determined. Freedom Shield will take place as planned, but authorities were in talks for possible changes to on-field training, a military official said. Military officials, fire authorities and officials from the local government plan to conduct a safety inspection of the accident site early Friday. The city government of Pocheon has activated a disaster control headquarters to cope with the aftermath of the accident.",(8th LD) 15 injured after KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly drop bombs outside training range,Lee Minji,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-06T19:57:48,2025-03-06T19:57:48,gemini-2.0-flash

Zelensky has since said he is ""ready to work"" under Trump's ""strong leadership"", an apparent cooling in tensions welcomed by Trump - and which comes after the US paused military aid to Kyiv. But Mr Zaluzhnyi's remarks at a conference at Chatham House in London on Thursday suggest there remains discontent over the US's actions. He told an audience: ""We see that it is not only Russia and the axis of evil trying to destroy the world order, but the US is actually destroying it completely"". The Ukrainian envoy added that talks between the US and Russia - the latter of which was ""headed by a war criminal"" in President Vladimir Putin - showed the White House was making ""steps towards the Kremlin regime, fully realising that in this case Europe could be a new target for Russia"". Mr Zaluzhnyi, who took over as Kyiv's ambassador to London in 2024 following three years as commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, also suggested that Nato could cease to exist as a result of Washington's change in posture. While Zelensky has expressed a wish to bring the war in Ukraine to an end swiftly, Kyiv has voiced concerns about the Trump administration's handling of talks and the concessions to Moscow that may be made without firm security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump vowed during the US election campaign to bring the war to an end quickly, and preliminary US-Russian talks were held in Saudi Arabia last month - without European or Ukrainian representatives present. The US's decision to halt its military assistance to Ukraine and intelligence sharinghas been cast by Trump administration officials as a means of getting Kyiv to co-operatewith the US-led peace talks. Any corresponding pressure the US has been putting on Moscow to make concessions has not been made public. Zaluzhnyi said the pause in intelligence sharing, as well as an earlier decision to oppose a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine, were ""a huge challenge for the entire world"". His comments come as Politico reports that members of Trump's team held discussions with some of Zelensky's political opponents, after Trump allies suggested the Ukrainian president should stand aside as his term expired in May. Citing unnamed sources in the US and Ukraine, it says talks were held with opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and senior members of Petro Poroshenko's party, who preceded Zelensky as president. Independent opinion polls in Ukraine suggest Zaluzhnyi has the most public support with at least 70%, Zelensky has 57% support, and Poroshenko about 20%. Tymoshenko and Poroshenko both have their own red lines and share a pro-European stance. Responding to the report, Tymoshenko said her team was talking with ""all allies who can help ensure a just peace as soon as possible"", while noting elections cannot be held under Ukraine's constitution while it is under martial law. Poroshenko wrote in a lengthy statement that his party worked ""publicly and transparently"" with the US, and that meetings have focused on supporting Ukraine's war effort. While criticising Zelensky's government over its political decisions and communications with the US, he too stressed that elections could only take place after a ceasefire was signed. While the Politico article suggested the Trump administration may be seeking an alternative to Zelensky, these meetings appear to be long-standing and predate both the war and the recent straining of ties with the US.","US 'destroying' world order, Ukraine's ambassador to UK says","Aleks Phillips, Vitaly Chervonenko",BBC News,2025-03-06T12:43:11.548Z,2025-03-06T13:48:45.655Z,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-trump-canada-tariffs-921138ff86144357b36610475d37801e,"TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is unwilling to lift Canada’s retaliatory tariffs on the United States if President Donald Trump leaves any U.S. tariffs on Canada, a senior government official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The official confirmed Trudeau’s stance on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The official said Trump and Trudeau spoke by phone around midday. Other Canadian officials publicly echoed Trudeau’s position. “We’re not interested in meeting in the middle and having some reduced tariff. Canada wants the tariffs removed,” Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the leader of Canada’s most populous province, agreed. “Zero tariffs or nothing. This attack was not started by our country. This was started by President Trump. He decided to declare an economic war against our country and our province, and we’re going to hold strong,” Ford said. Trump launched a new trade war Tuesday by imposing tariffs against Washington’s three biggest trading partners, drawing immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China and sending financial markets into a tailspin. Trump put 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. A day after the new tariffs took effect, Trump said he would grant a one-month exemption for U.S. automakers. The announcement came after Trump spoke Wednesday with leaders of Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep. His press secretary said Trump told the chief executives to move auto production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs. “A number of industries have reached out to us to ask us for exemptions to the tariffs,” Vice President JD Vance said. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said exceptions might be considered — a statement that reflected a softening of the American position after the import taxes hurt the stock market and worried consumers. Ford took note of the anxiety, saying the American people “woke up two days ago when the market was crashing.” Americans “are voicing their opinion. The CEOs, the market tanked. That’s what really caught his (Trump’s) attention.” Some Canadian provinces banned the sale of American booze, including Manitoba, whose leader, Wab Kinew, mocked Trump by signing a “beautiful” order that officially removes all U.S. liquor from stores in his province. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said they are not interested in going “through this psychodrama every 30 days so.” “There’s too much unpredictability and chaos coming of the White House right now,” Joly said. “He wants to weaken us and once he has weakened us possibly try to annex Canada. He has said this in the past.” In an interview Wednesday with Bloomberg Television, Lutnick said: “There are going to be tariffs. Let’s be clear.” But he also said the president was considering offering relief to some sections of the market until April 2. On April 2, Trump plans to announce what he calls “reciprocal” tariffs to match the tariffs, taxes and subsidies from other countries. That could dramatically increase the tariff rates charged globally while maintaining the risk of broader tariffs. If the tariffs are not removed, Ford told the AP, the American and Canadian auto industries will last approximately 10 days before they start shutting down assembly lines in the U.S. and Ontario. “People are going to lose their jobs,” Ford said. Lutnick said he would talk Wednesday with Trump about the possible options regarding Canada and Mexico, saying that both countries are working to address the U.S. president’s concerns about drug trafficking. Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, noted that Trudeau called the tariffs “very dumb” at a news conference Tuesday and said Trudeau’s tough talk resonated well with Canadians. “Canada had a choice: to go along with Lutnick’s proposal or to reject it. The government opted for the latter, but that may be a negotiating ploy. It is playing well with Canadians. They are very angry with Trump,” Wiseman said. Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser to Trump who said he watched Trudeau’s news conference, told CNN on Wednesday that it would be useful if the prime minister “toned stuff down.” But Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Trudeau’s comments were likely intended to project strength. “Trump thrives on intimidation, and any sign of weakness on the part of Canada might help pave the way for more economic bullying. So that’s probably why the prime minister is showing resolve, at least in public,” Béland said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he spoke with the premiers of Manitoba and Ontario, calling it an “unnecessary and costly trade war.” “While the President may not value the partnerships that contribute billions of dollars to our economy, Minnesota does,” Walz posted on social media.",Trudeau not willing to lift retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves some tariffs on Canada | AP News,Rob Gillies,AP News,2025-03-05T16:07:20,2025-03-05T21:59:57,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/gabon-presidential-election-nguema-candidate-5a1d3364e6fcffa23424287d48d5a61c,"LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) — Gabon’s military leader announced Monday that he would run as a candidate in the oil-rich central African nation’s presidential election set for April 12. Gen. Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, who is interim president, led a 2023 military coup that toppled President Ali Bongo Ondimba, who many Gabonese accused of irresponsible governance and major embezzlement that risked leading the country into chaos. “After careful consideration and in response to your numerous appeals, I have decided to stand as a candidate in the presidential election,” Nguema said during a speech to his supporters in the capital Libreville. In August 2023, soldiers proclaimed Nguema, who was the republican guard chief and a cousin of Bongo, as president of a transitional committee to lead the country. The announcement of his candidacy came after the adoption last month by Gabon’s parliament of a new electoral code, which sets out the rules and conditions for organizing elections in the country. The legislation was contentious as it authorized military personnel to be candidates in all political elections in the country, which wasn’t possible in the past. It paved the way for Nguema to run for his first presidential term. Gabon’s constitution, which was adopted in a referendum in November, sets the presidential term at seven years, renewable once. Bongo, the toppled president, had served two terms after coming to power in 2009 following the death of his father, who ruled the country for 41 years. There was widespread discontent with his family’s reign. Gabon, a former French colony, is a member of OPEC, but its oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few — and nearly 40% of Gabonese ranging in age from 15 to 24 were out of work in 2020, according to the World Bank. Its oil export revenue was $6 billion in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",Gabon's military leader announces he will run in April presidential election,Yves Laurent Goma,AP News,2025-03-03T18:56:50Z,2025-03-03T14:56:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/japan-pm-asserts-defence-budget-independence-amid-us-nominees-push-for-higher-spending,"TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Wednesday that other nations do not decide its defence budget after U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee for a top Pentagon policy role called for Tokyo to spend more to counter China. ""Japan decides its defence budget by itself,"" Ishiba told parliament. ""It should not be decided based on what other nations tell it to do."" In 2022, Japan announced a 43 trillion yen ($287.09 billion) military build-up strategy over five years, doubling its defence budget to about 2% of the country's gross domestic product, to counter escalating security threats from China, Russia and North Korea. Elbridge Colby, the Trump administration's nominee to become under secretary of defense for policy, said Japan should increase its spending. ""Japan should be spending at least 3% of GDP on defense as soon as possible and accelerating the revamp of its military to focus on a denial defense of its own archipelago and collective defense in its region,"" Colby said in a written response to advance policy questions from U.S. senators. Japan's top government spokesperson said the nation's defence buildup prioritises quality over the size of its budget. ""What we think important is the substance of defence capabilities, not the volume or GDP ratio,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told a regular press conference. Colby admonished Taiwan and Japan for acting too slowly to raise defence spending. REUTERS JoinST's Telegram channeland get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c981w25y5wpo,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special â
82¬500bn (Â£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" orSchuldenbremse,limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a â
82¬100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra â
82¬30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of â
82¬500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; â
82¬100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.",Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,Paul Kirby,BBC News,2025-03-05T07:03:05,2025-03-05T07:03:05,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-pledge-to-trump-jordan-evacuates-first-group-of-gazan-kids-for-medical-care/,"Jordan on Tuesday evacuated the first group of Palestinian children in need of medical treatment from the war-battered Gaza Strip under a plan the king presented to US President Donald Trump last month. Images aired by state TV channel Al-Mamlaka showed Jordanian military helicopters arriving at a military airport in Amman carrying four injured children and their families. The children, two of them amputees, were taken to hospital upon arrival. Government spokesman Mohammad Momani told a news conference that the first group “of the Gazan children suffering various illnesses began arriving.” Momani said it was the start of the “implementation of the initiative that the king spoke about in Washington.” In his White House visit last month, King Abdullah II told Trump: “One of the things that we can do right away is take 2,000 children, cancer children who are in a very ill state. That is possible.” Later on Tuesday, another 29 children accompanied by 44 adults were brought into Jordan by land, a military spokesman said. Ambulances carrying them entered via the King Hussein Bridge crossing, also known as Allenby Bridge crossing, between the Israeli-controlled West Bank and Jordan. Ahmad Shehada, 13, told AFP he was eager to “get my life back” after a serious injury. The boy, whose father and other relatives died in the war sparked by the Hamas-led terror onslaught on October 7, 2023,, said he had gone to get water when “a helicopter dropped a strange object, and it exploded on us.” Shehada lost an arm and “traveled to Jordan to have a (prosthetic) limb fitted,” he said. The war has killed over 48,000 people in Gaza and left more than 100,000 wounded, according to unverified figures from the Hamas-ruled territory’s health ministry, which do not differentiate between fighters and non-combatants. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7, during which some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — were killed and 251 abducted to Gaza. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques. Israel’s toll in the ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza and in military operations along the border with the Strip stands at 410.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250305002400315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, March 5 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's humanitarian assistance to North Korea reached zero last year for the first time in nearly 30 years, amid Pyongyang's continued antagonistic stance toward Seoul, the unification ministry said Wednesday. Not a single humanitarian assistance program for North Korea was carried out last year, either at the government or private level, according to the ministry. It marked the first time that such aid to North Korea has come to zero since South Korea began providing humanitarian assistance in 1995, when torrential rain and flooding in the North caused severe food shortages. South Korea provided 150,000 tons of rice to North Korea at that time. Seoul's humanitarian aid to Pyongyang has since continued and peaked at 439.7 billion won (US$302.1 million) in 2007 before starting to decline as North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile development gained traction. The last such aid to North Korea was a nutrition support program for North Korean children, carried out in 2023 with a budget of 900 million won, which included 700 million won in private funding. The last direct assistance from the South Korean government was a forest pest control product provision worth 1.2 billion won in 2018. The last assistance through an international organization was food aid worth 11.8 billion won, carried out in 2020 via the World Food Program, although it remains unexecuted due to North Korea's refusal. The absence of humanitarian assistance from South Korea to North Korea came as Pyongyang continues its enmity toward Seoul, most notably marked by leader Kim Jong-un's 2023 order to designate South Korea as its primary foe. ""North Korea is not accepting most outside assistance proposals, except those from UNICEF. Its refusal of those from South Korea is stronger,"" a unification ministry official said.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/us-should-wait-for-concrete-steps-before-easing-sanctions-on-russia-says-ukraine/,"The US should wait for “concrete steps” from Russia before lifting sanctions, a senior Ukrainian official told Euractiv amid recent reports that Donald Trump could ease restrictive measures on Moscow ahead of further talks to end the war in Ukraine. Vladyslav Vlasiuk, an adviser on sanctions policy to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said that the recent “discussions” about easing sanctions were ""expected,"" as ""sanctions are not a punishment but a means of pressure."" “The right approach would be to first see concrete steps from the aggressor,” Vlasiuk added. “Easing sanctions in advance while trusting Russia’s goodwill is not an option.” Vlasiuk’s comments follow a Reuters report on Monday that the White House had tasked State and Treasury Department officials with drawing up plans to lift sanctions on Russia, the majority of which were imposed following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The report, which cited a US official and a person familiar with the matter, said the plan included proposals to ease restrictive measures on both Russian citizens and companies. In January, Trump threatened to impose further sanctions on Moscow if a ""deal"" to end the war was not made ""soon."" Following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month, however, Trump and other senior White House officials have repeatedly signalled that sanctions could be eased if progress is made toward a peace deal. US and Russian officials met twice last month, in Riyadh and in Istanbul, to discuss ending the Ukraine war. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, also said on Tuesday that Russia must be “freed” from sanctions in order for relations between Moscow and Washington to be “normalised,” according to Russia's state news agency TASS. However, Peskov said the Kremlin has “not heard any official statements” from the White House about potential sanctions relief and admitted that such discussions at the present moment are “probably premature.” Washington's warming relationship with Moscow comes as Trump has become increasingly critical of his Ukrainian counterpart, Zelenskyy, whom he accused of “gambling with WWIII” in a tumultuous exchange in the Oval Office on Friday. The US also cut military aid to Ukraine late on Monday while Zelenskyy has thus far refrained from signing a deal that would boost US access to his country's rare minerals. The EU, meanwhile, passed a 16th round of sanctions on Moscow last month, while European officials have repeatedly pledged to maintain an “independent” sanctions policy. EU envoys to Brussels will meet to discuss EU-US relations tomorrow, ahead of a special summit of European leaders on Ukraine and defence policy on Thursday.

https://www.rferl.org/a/china-russia-xi-putin-zelenskyy-trump-diplomacy/33334906.html,"After a week of runaway diplomacy around how to end the war in Ukraine that has widened rifts between the United States and other Western powers and raised new questions about the future of US assistance for Ukraine, China is looking at how it can capitalize. For Beijing, the diplomatic fissures between the United States and its European allies -- the latest of which was opened up by an Oval Office clash between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- presents new opportunities to repair its own battered relations with Europe. The fallout could also ripple out to Asia, where countries aligned with Washington, such as Taiwan, are grappling with the implications of a more transactional United States and the opportunities that could create for China as it looks to ramp up pressure and assert itself more powerfully in the Pacific. “This has been pretty unequivocally good for China,” Andrew Small, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin who previously advised the European Commission on China strategy, told RFE “Beijing sees the wider opportunities that this could bring, from Taiwan contingencies to more global cooperation with Russia to a weakened United States.” China had already been reaching out to Brussels and European capitals before the dustup in Washington that saw Zelenskyy leave the White House early without signing an important minerals deal after being berated by Trump and Vice President JD Vance. That ongoing outreach by Chinese diplomats has looked to exploit fears that US efforts to reset the relationship with Russia and quickly end the war in Ukraine could leave European countries abandoned by their ally, three European Union officials told RFE No media source currently available Beijing, which has professed neutrality but has supported Russia amid its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, is now looking to expand on its pitch and benefit from the transatlantic rift, including from Trump’s plan to hit goods made in the EU with 25 percent tariffs, which Brussels said it would retaliate against with countermeasures of its own against the US economy. Small says that this Chinese effort is still in an early “fact-finding phase” to “discover what kind of openings are available in this new context.” “Whatever China puts forward will be met with skepticism,” he said. “But Beijing thinks they will see some opportunities if they can navigate this first phase, especially if tariffs hit.” China has largely been content to remain on the margins amid the flurry of diplomatic activity since Trump took office in January, but officials have been probing the European side. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China believes all stakeholders should participate in peace talks, underscoring Europe's role in them ahead of US-Russia talks in Riyadh that did not include Kyiv or European officials. “If I was Beijing, I’d be telling the Europeans what they want to hear and one thing they want to hear is that Europe and Kyiv should be at the table to discuss Ukraine’s future,” Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, an assistant professor at National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan and a former adviser to the European Parliament, told RFE On the sidelines of the conference, retired Chinese colonel Zhou Bomade headlines during an interviewin which he floated the prospect of Chinese and Indian peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a settlement to end the war. That was followed by comments by Wang at the Group of 20 (G20) meeting of foreign ministers in South Africa where he said that the recent US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia were a “window of opportunity for peace” in Ukraine and that “China will continue playing a constructive role in the political settlement of the crisis.” Ferenczy sees these comments as trial balloons as Beijing tests how receptive its outreach will be, but she cautions that years of trade spats between Brussels and Beijing, as well as strained ties from China's economic support of Russia throughout the war and the supply of dual-use goods for its war efforts, will be difficult to shake. Beijing will also need to overcome the perception that its diplomatic efforts are more about image building than actual peacemaking. Soon after the war began, Chinese leader Xi Jinping rushed to paint China as neutral and Chinese diplomats called for peace at international forums. In 2023, Beijing issued a 12-point peace plan for Ukraine that seemed designed to set the stage for a cease-fire and peace talks, but it provided no clear roadmap to end the war and was dismissed by Western officials as setting the stage for a peace on Russia’s terms. In a similar vein, EU officials say that Beijing is yet to present any new offers to the 27-country bloc in its early rounds of outreach beyond rhetoric about an unreliable United States and the prospect of normalizing trade relations. “It’s unavoidable that we will be affected by statements from Beijing that sound good to us,” Ferenczy said. “But a less reliable United States doesn’t make China more reliable all of a sudden.” The Trump administration has said that its efforts are designed to push allies to pay a bigger share of their own defense needs, recalibrate trade relationships, and bring an end to the war in Ukraine. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also said that, if the United States were to scale back military assistance for Ukraine, it would allow Washington to focus its resources on the Asia-Pacific region, where the administration has said countering China is a priority. But there are early signs that Washington’s approach to ending the war in Ukraine will have ripple effects further east, particularly in Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing has vowed to annex if it refuses to peacefully accept unification. Taiwan has long faced the possibility of a Chinese invasion, but pressure also looks to be growing. No media source currently available On February 28, China’s Defense Ministry would not rule out the use of force against Taiwan, and its spokesman Wu Qian warned the United States that “playing sneaky tricks on Taiwan would only backfire.” Those comments came after Taiwanese authorities said they had detained a cargo ship crewed by Chinese nationals, which they believe may have severed an undersea communications cable. Following that, the Chinese military held what Taipei said was unannounced ""shooting training"" off the island’s southern coast. Taiwan’s ability to deter a potential attack hinges on whether the United States stands ready to help, and the Taiwanese government has seen US assistance for Ukraine assomething of a bellwetherfor how Washington could react in the event of a crisis with China. Ryan Hass, a former director for China on the US National Security Council, said that Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine and his recent spat with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office will no doubt cause anxiety in Taipei, but added that Taiwan’s unique position as the manufacturer of 90 percent of the world’s most-advanced semiconductors leave it in a unique position with the United States. Trump has called for Taipei to increase defense spending and said that he wants to move some of the island’s semiconductor foundries, which manufacturers the chips largely for US tech companies, to the United States. Any type of relocation, however, would be a costly and slow process. Hass says this makes Taiwan “indispensable to Trump’s goals for an American industrial renaissance” as he looks to revamp manufacturing back home. “Taiwan needs the US, but the U. also needs Taiwan,” Hasswrote on X. “Trump knows this fact. There is a complementary division of labor between US tech companies and Taiwan’s chip foundries that cannot be replaced.” The CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) visited the White House on March 3 and afterwardannounced plansto make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a leading supplier to major US hardware manufacturers, said the plan involves building five facilities in the United States in coming years.

https://bulgarianmilitary.com/2025/03/04/houthis-claim-another-mq-9-trophy-in-their-sky-high-standoff/,"On March 4, 2025, Yemenâ	ms Houthi rebels claimed to have shot down yet another U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone, an unmanned aerial vehicle valued at over $30 million, over the Hodeida district in western Yemen. According to a statement from the Houthi armed forces, their air defenses successfully targeted the drone while it was allegedly conducting hostile operations in Yemeni airspace. If confirmed, this incident would mark the 15th MQ-9 Reaper downed by the Iran-backed group since the onset of their intensified campaign in late 2023, a period that coincides with the escalation of regional tensions tied to the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. military has not yet responded to the latest claim, though officials have previously acknowledged some losses while disputing the total number of drones the Houthis assert they have destroyed. The incident, reported by Houthi-aligned media and circulating on social platforms, underscores the ongoing challenge the group poses to American aerial operations in the region. Yemeni military claims to have shot down another MQ-9 Reaper drone worth over $30 millionit would be the 15th Reaper shot down over Yemen.pic.twitter.com The MQ-9 Reaper, produced by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a cornerstone of the U.S. militaryâ	ms unmanned fleet, designed to fulfill a dual role of intelligence gathering and precision strikes. Introduced in 2007 as an evolution of the earlier MQ-1 Predator, the Reaper represents a significant leap in capability, blending advanced surveillance technology with lethal firepower. Measuring 36 feet in length with a wingspan of 66 feet, the drone is powered by a Honeywell TPE331-10 turboprop engine, enabling it to reach speeds of up to 240 miles per hour and maintain flight for as long as 24 hours, depending on its configuration and payload. Its operational ceiling reaches 50,000 feet, allowing it to loiter above targets at altitudes beyond the reach of many conventional air defense systems. This endurance and altitude make it an ideal platform for persistent surveillance over vast areas, a feature that has proven invaluable in conflict zones like Yemen, where the U.S. has long sought to monitor and counter extremist groups such as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite, the Reaper carries a multi-spectral targeting system that includes electro-optical and infrared cameras, capable of tracking targets day or night in all weather conditions. It also features synthetic aperture radar for mapping terrain and detecting movement, alongside signals intelligence equipment that can intercept communications. This array of sensors feeds real-time data to operators, often stationed thousands of miles away in facilities like Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, who control the drone via satellite link. On the offensive side, the Reaper can be armed with a variety of munitions, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and, in some configurations, GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions. With a payload capacity of approximately 3,850 pounds, it can carry up to 14 Hellfire missiles, a stark contrast to the Predatorâ	ms maximum of two. This combination of long endurance, high-altitude operation, and precision strike capability has made the MQ-9 a workhorse for the U.S. military and the Central Intelligence Agency, deployed extensively in counterterrorism missions across the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. Despite its technological prowess, the Reaper is not invulnerable, as the Houthis have repeatedly demonstrated. The groupâ	ms campaign against U.S. drones in Yemen has intensified since November 2023, when they began targeting American assets in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict, framing their actions as solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The first reported downing of an MQ-9 Reaper by the Houthis occurred earlier, in 2017 when the rebels claimed to have used a surface-to-air missile to destroy a drone over northern Yemen. Another followed in 2019, with the U.S. acknowledging the loss but offering few details. The pace of these incidents accelerated dramatically in 2023, beginning with a confirmed shootdown on November 8 over international waters off Yemenâ	ms coast, an event the Pentagon attributed to Houthi air defenses. In 2024, the losses mounted. On February 20, a Reaper was downed near Hodeida, followed by another on April 27 over Saada province, where Houthi footage showed wreckage bearing General Atomics markings. May saw two more incidents: one on May 17 in Marib province and another on May 29 in the same region, both accompanied by Houthi videos of debris. September proved particularly costly, with the U.S. acknowledging two Reapers lost on September 8 and September 18, the latter in Marib, though the Pentagon disputed the Houthisâ	m claim of a higher total. The campaign continued into late 2024 and early 2025. On November 8, 2024, videos emerged of a flaming aircraft crashing in al-Jawf province, which the Houthis identified as another Reaper, though the U.S. military described it only as an ongoing investigation. December 28, 2024, brought a confirmed downing over Al Bayda governorate, followed four days later, on January 1, 2025, by another in Marib, marking the 13th and 14th losses according to Houthi tallies. Each incident has been trumpeted by the group as evidence of their growing military prowess, often with footage of wreckage or missile launches released through their media channels. The U.S. response has typically been measured, confirming some losses while conducting retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets, including missile launchers and radar sites, as part of operations like Poseidon Archer. Yet the precise circumstances of many shootdowns remain murky, with the Pentagon occasionally attributing crashes to technical failures rather than enemy action, a claim the Houthis dismiss as propaganda. Speculation about the weapons responsible for these downings centers on the Houthisâ	m evolving air defense capabilities, bolstered by Iranian support. One likely candidate is the 358 missile, a loitering surface-to-air system first identified in Yemen in 2019. Developed by Iran, this missile combines features of a drone and a traditional missile, using a solid rocket booster for launch and a turbojet engine for sustained flight. With a range estimated at 100 kilometers and an altitude capability exceeding 10 kilometers, it is designed to engage low-flying or hovering targets like helicopters and drones. Its imaging infrared seeker and satellite navigation allow it to loiter in an area, waiting for a target to appear, making it a plausible threat to the Reaperâ	ms operational profile. The Houthis have also been linked to older Soviet-era systems, such as the SA-6 Gainful, inherited from pre-war Yemeni military stocks, though these are less suited to the Reaperâ	ms high-altitude flights. More advanced Iranian designs, like the Sayyad-2C or variants of the Taer series, could also be in play, offering ranges and guidance systems capable of challenging U.S. drones. While the Houthis claim some missiles areâ	mslocally produced,â	texperts widely agree that their arsenal relies heavily on Tehranâ	ms technology and supply lines, despite Iranâ	ms denials and a U.N. arms embargo. The repeated downing of MQ-9 Reapers over Yemen raises uncomfortable questions about the droneâ	ms role in the region and the broader U.S. strategy there. At over $30 million apiece, the financial toll of these lossesâ	mpotentially approaching half a billion dollars if the Houthi count holdsâ	maids up quickly, even for a military with a budget in the hundreds of billions. More troubling is the symbolic cost: each downed drone fuels Houthi propaganda and undermines the perception of American technological dominance. The Reaperâ	ms strengthsâ	mds ability to linger over targets and deliver precise strikesâ	malso expose its weaknesses, particularly its reliance on an unjammed satellite link and its lack of agility against increasingly sophisticated air defenses. As the Houthis refine their tactics and weaponry, possibly with Iranian guidance, the U.S. faces a dilemma. Escalating airstrikes risks further entanglement in Yemenâ	ms complex civil war while reducing drone deployments could cede valuable intelligence and strike capabilities. For now, the skies over Yemen remain a proving ground not just for the Reaperâ	ms resilience, but for the limits of American power projection in an era of persistent, asymmetric threats. The frequency of these incidents in recent months suggests that neither side is backing down, leaving open the question of how long this costly aerial chess game can continue without a decisive shift. *** Follow us everywhere and at any time.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge1qq4jdxdo,"Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to work under Donald Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace days after their explosive Oval Office meeting. The Ukrainian president described the White House showdown as ""regrettable"" in a lengthy social media post in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. ""We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky – ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure – and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same,"" he wrote. ""Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal."" In his social media post, Zelensky said Friday's meeting ""did not go the way it was supposed to be"", adding: ""It is regrettable that it happened this way,"" he wrote. ""It is time to make things right. We would like future co-operation and communication to be constructive."" He also reiterated that Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the US, after the failure to do so at the Washington meeting. Ukraine woke to the news on Tuesday that the US was ""pausing and reviewing"" its military aid to the country after a breakdown in diplomacy last week. In his post, Zelensky offered an overt declaration of gratitude for the help the US has so far given to his country. ""We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,"" he wrote. ""And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins. We are grateful for this,"" he added, referring to the US anti-tank missile system sold to Ukraine during Trump's first administration. During Friday's meeting in the Oval Office, Vice-President JD Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for the military support the US had provided. ""Have you said 'thank you' once this entire meeting?"" Vance said, before Trump told Zelensky he was not being ""very thankful"". Zelensky defended himself in the meeting, and began an interview with Fox News in the hours afterwards, saying: ""I'm very thankful to Americans for all your support."" The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War III"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal – Trump told Zelensky ""come back when you're ready for peace"". Trump is due to deliver an address to Congress later on Tuesday, during which the Reuters news agency reports he plans to announce a minerals deal between US and Ukraine has been signed. A number of Ukraine's allies have commented on the latest from the Ukrainian president, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who welcomed Zelensky's ""steadfast commitment to securing peace"". It is ""vital that all parties worked towards a lasting and secure peace for Ukraine as soon as possible"", a statement from No 10 said. Likewise, French President Emmanuel Macron praised Zelensky's willingness to ""re-engage in dialogue"" with Trump, the Elysee Palace said. Days before his meeting with Zelensky, the US President had met with Macron, who travelled to Washington with a warning to Trump: ""You can't be weak in the face of Putin."" While European leaders rallied behind Zelensky following the clash, Nato's secretary general advised the Ukrainian leader to ""find a way"" to restore his relationship with Trump. Speaking to the BBC the following day, Mark Rutte said he had told him ""we have to respect"" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far. Follow live: Trump pauses US military aid to Ukraine Zelensky's statement falls short of an apology to Trump, which those in the US president's camp had called for. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin's team earlier welcomed the US's pause to military aid as likely to be the ""best"" contribution to peace. ""If the US stops, or pauses these supplies, this will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg. Trump himself has not commented on the pause to aid, nor Zelensky's response, however he did earlier berate the Ukrainian leader following his meetings with European allies at the weekend. A Sunday summit - hosted by the UK prime minister - was intended as a show of support for Ukraine. After the meeting, Zelensky said a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia was ""still very, very far away"". Trump described this as the ""worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky"", in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's backing,"" the president wrote.",Zelensky vows to 'make things right' with Trump and negotiate peace,Jacqueline Howard,BBC News,2025-03-04T13:32:28,2025-03-04T18:15:22,gemini-2.0-flash

The statement came in reaction to the adoption of the plan during the Arab summit, which convened in Cairo. According to the Egyptian plan, an administrative committee of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats would govern Gaza temporarily in preparation for the Palestinian Authority's return in the Strip. ""The statement continues to rely on the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA — Both have repeatedly demonstrated corruption, support for terrorism, and failure in resolving the issue,"" the Foreign Ministry said. The ministry also stated the statement issued bore no mention of Hamas nor the October 7 massacre. ""For 77 years, Arab states have used Palestinians as pawns against Israel, condemning them to eternal 'refugee' status,"" the ministry continued.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-844701,"While the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) took a significant amount of responsibility for the disasters on October 7 in its report published unexpectedly on Tuesday, it also implicated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by implying that his policies regarding the Temple Mount, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, and the judicial reform led to Hamas’s decision to initiate its long-planned invasion. Other policies carried out under Netanyahu that the agency flagged as problematic and as contributions to Hamas’s decision to invade were his facilitation of Qatari funding to Hamas and his opposition to proposed assassination operations of top Hamas leaders at the time. Israeli intelligence has said that Qatar eventually developed two funding pipelines to Hamas. One was supervised by Israel and, at least officially, only went to Gaza's civilian needs. However, Israeli intelligence has said that another funding pipeline, especially in more recent years, circumvented Israeli oversight and went directly to Hamas. Besides the second funding pipeline, Israeli intelligence analysts have pointed out that the funding that went to civilian Gazan needs made it easier for Hamas to spend more of its existing funds on the vast terror and military operations that the IDF was confronted with in Gaza during the war. The report never mentions Netanyahu by name, and technically, some of these policies were those of then-national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Netanyahu, though, as prime minister, allowed many of the policies to continue despite having the power to stop them. Ben-Gvir vastly expanded the volume of Jewish visitors to the Temple Mount compared to prior years, violated some of the rules of what activities could be performed on the Temple Mount, publicly called for completely changing the “status quo” there, and enforced policies that worsened the treatment of Palestinian prisoners. His moves led to public condemnations by moderate Sunni Arab allies, the West, and Hamas, and to private warnings by theShin Bet. The judicial reform was also a Netanyahu policy, although just as his critics can blame him for pushing the legislation forward, so can the prime minister argue that the backlash against the reform impacted both the IDF’s readiness and Hamas’s perception of the army’s capabilities. At another key point in the report, the Shin Bet wrote that even as it was implementing its own vast reforms for its massive failures on October 7, these would be insufficient in preventing future disasters, barring changes in the interface between the political and defense echelons. Most of the report, however, was about the Shin Bet’s own failures. It did not warn about an invasion, it misinterpreted Hamas’s intentions – both before October 7 and on the day – it failed to adjust to Hamas as a sophisticated military entity, allowing Hamas to massively arm itself, and it did not recognize the depth of the harm being done to Israeli deterrence. Another blind spot was the agency’s belief on the eve of October 7 that Hamas might be focused on an attack in the West Bank, partially because its leaders carried out an unusual terrorist attack there on October 5. Conceptually wise, the Shin Bet said that it had far too much confidence in the IDF’s hi-tech border fence, was too invested in quiet and stability, and was too worried about miscalculations in pressuring Hamas that could lead to instability or an “unnecessary” war – as the 2014 conflict was viewed.",Shin Bet hints Netanyahu's policies motivated Hamas's October 7 attack,YONAH JEREMY BOB,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-04T14:29:00,2025-03-05T13:22:00,gemini-2.0-flash

Foreign backers of thePalestinian Authority(PA), which is based in the Israeli-occupiedWest Bank, have long asked for a vice-president to be appointed. Abbas, 89, has been in power since 2005 following the death of Palestinian leaderYasser Arafat. The following year he was elected to a four-year term, with no presidential vote since. The Palestinian president, addressing Arab leaders meeting in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss the post-war reconstruction of theGaza Stripand come up with an alternative toUS President Donald Trump's ""Gaza Riviera"" plan, said he would restructure the PA.

""We are fully prepared to hold general presidential and legislative elections next year, provided that the appropriate conditions are met in Gaza, the West Bank and eastJerusalem,"" Abbas said.
The most prominent among of the expelled dissidents who could be affected by the announcement is Mohammed Dahlan, 63, a former Fatah security chief in the Gaza Strip.
Dahlan, excluded from the party after his security forces were forced out of the Palestinian territory by Hamas militants, is seen as a potential key actor in the post-war governance of Gaza, now ruled by the Fatah's domestic rivalHamas.
Now based in the UAE, Dahlan has also faced corruption charges.
Abbas, a native of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, had suggested in 2024 that Arab states should send troops to help keep order in post-war Gaza, where Saudi and UAE money could help fund reconstruction.
In his opening remarks to the summit,
Abbas also insisted that the
Palestinian Authority was the only legitimate governing and military force in the Palestinian Territories.

https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-aid-military-pause-trump-war-zelenskiy-zelenskyy/33335335.html,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that the tense Oval Office meeting with US President Donald Trump last week was ""regrettable,"" and that he is willing to work with Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve long-term peace. Zelenskyy's remarks came in a social media post on X, hours after the White House announced a pause in military aid to Ukraine, which is critical to fighting Russia's invasion. ""The meeting did not go the way it was supposed to,"" Zelenskyy said. ""It's unfortunate that it happened this way. It's time to make things right. We want future cooperation and communication to be constructive."" Saying that ""none of us want an endless war,"" he added that ""Ukraine is ready to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring long-term peace closer...My team and I are ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to achieve long-term peace."" Zelenskyy thanked the US for its support during the war and said Kyiv was ""ready"" to sign the US-proposed minerals deal, even though his remarks did not specifically address the US decision to halt aid to Ukraine. Late on March 3, senior US officials told multiple media outlets that Trump had ordered a pause in all military aid to Ukraine, piling pressure on Kyiv to fall in line with US efforts to broker a peace deal with Russia despite a lack of security guarantees for Ukraine. ""We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,"" reports quoted a White House official as saying on condition of anonymity. ""The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well."" ""This is not permanent termination of aid, it's a pause,"" Fox News quoted a Trump administration official as saying. The suspension will last until Trump determines that Ukraine's leaders demonstrate a good-faith commitment to peace, according to Bloomberg and Fox News. Speaking from Washington on March 4, US Vice President JD Vance spoke about the US decision to suspend military aid. Vance said the US needs to ""get some payback for the incredible financial investment"" it has made in Ukraine. When asked if the US would resume providing military aid to Ukraine, Vance says that ""everything is on the table"" once Kyiv begins negotiating. Reports of the suspension widened the rift between Zelenskyy and the Trump administration, which had long been troubled but split wide openat the White House meeting. The pause amplifies already deafening questions about US support for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian invasion at a time when Moscow's forces have been gaining ground for many months, albeit at a massive cost in casualties, and Ukraine struggles withmanpower problemsand other challenges in the biggest war in Europe since 1945. It is likely to add to concerns in Kyiv and among its supporters in the West that Ukraine could be pressured into a cease-fire or a peace deal that favors Moscow. Those worries increased after Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin in mid-February and then sent top officials to meet their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. The Kremlin welcomed the news. ""If itâ											 s true, then itâ											 s a decision that really could push the Kyiv regime into a peace process,â											 d Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""If the United States stops being [an arms supplier] or suspends these supplies, it will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace,"" he said. Any disruption in the flow of US arms to the front line would rapidly weaken Ukraine's chance of beating back Russia's invasion. The suspension applies to ""all US military equipment not currently in Ukraine, including weapons in transit on aircraft and ships or waiting in transit areas in Poland,"" Bloomberg reported. ""The suspension of U.S. assistance for Ukraine is a very unfortunate and significant development, but it may not have immediate impact,"" Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an expert on the Ukrainian and Russian militaries,wrote in a threadon X. ""Ukraine is far less dependent on the U.S. for day to day battlefield needs in 2025, than it was in earlier periods of the war. "" ""Much depends on the extent [to which] Ukraine has been stockpiling munitions and where Europeans can step in, although in some cases they have low inventories, and in others U.S. retains the ability to deny any transfers,"" Kofman wrote. ""The impact will probably be much more visible in a few months. The pause ""will have a bad impact, of course, if you deprive Ukraine of assistance from the United States, whether it's financial aid or military aid,"" independent military analyst Yury Federov told Current Time.

https://apnews.com/article/france-nuclear-weapons-deterrence-ukraine-russia-trump-a53dc73395455c753287ae2ecbb7a9a5,"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron says that he’s ready to start discussions on nuclear deterrence with European allies. Macron has hinted that France could help to protect other nations after U.S. President Donald Trump raised questions both about the trans-Atlantic alliance and the defense of Ukraine. While Macron’s offering has been on the table for several years, it has gained urgency after Trump’s remarks raised concerns among European NATO allies, which have for decades counted on the powerful U.S. deterrent. Here’s a look at France’s nuclear policy. What’s nuclear deterrence? Nuclear deterrence is a strategy based on the idea that the destructive force of nuclear weapons would prevent other nations’ hostile actions, particularly nuclear attacks. During the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear umbrella was aimed at ensuring that allies, especially NATO members, would be protected by American nuclear forces in case of a threat. That’s one of the reasons why many nations across the world haven’t pursued their own nuclear arsenals. France is the only nuclear power in the European Union. The United Kingdom, which is no longer an EU member but is working on restoring closer ties with the 27-nation bloc and belongs to NATO, also has nuclear weapons. In the wake of Trump’s push for Europe to carry the defense burden, German election winner Friedrich Merz recently called for a discussion on “nuclear sharing” with France. EU leaders are set to address the issue during a special summit in Brussels on Thursday, focusing on support for Ukraine and European defense. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer won’t be attending the summit. The only non-EU guest is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Protecting France and Europe France’s nuclear deterrence is strictly conceived as defensive. It is meant to protect the country’s “vital interests.” Although France is a NATO member, it independently maintains its nuclear forces, cooperating with the alliance’s broader deterrence strategy. Since a 2020 keynote speech, Macron has said that France’s “vital interests” have a “European dimension” — comments that he reiterated in recent days. “What may be new today ... is the somewhat urgent nature of these comments and how they are perceived abroad,” said Emmanuelle Maitre, senior research fellow at France’s Foundation for Strategic Research. “Obviously, faced with the feeling of abandonment felt by NATO countries, there’s some kind of logical search for what might enable them to keep some form of deterrence mission within Europe,” Maitre said. Fourth nuclear arsenal in the world Nuclear deterrence involves maintaining ambiguity about which circumstances would lead to the use of nuclear weapons, in order to prevent a potential aggressor from calculating risks — which is why France wouldn’t provide details over how it would help in defending other European countries. France “likes to remind people of its capabilities in order to be credible in its deterrence,” Maitre said. “But there’s also an element of ambiguity, because it’s not a question of telling our adversary exactly what our red lines are. No nuclear power does this.” The Federation of American Scientists, or FAS, estimates that all together, the United States and Russia possess approximately 88% of the world’s total inventory of nuclear weapons. They are followed at a distance by China, and France is in fourth position with an estimated 290 nuclear warheads. The U.K. has an estimated 225, according to the federation. The FAS notes that the exact number of weapons in each country’s possession is unknown because it’s a closely held national secret. France’s arsenal consists of ballistic missiles deployed on its nuclear-powered submarines and air-launched cruise missiles carried by long-range bombers. Maitre noted that the key for France’s strategy isn’t making a comparison with the U.S., but rather ensuring the capability to impose “an unacceptable response and damage on an adversary.” A domestic political debate Macron’s proposal to potentially use France’s nuclear arsenal to protect Europe has sparked backlash from far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally and allies form the biggest group of lawmakers at the National Assembly since last year’s legislative elections. Le Pen was quick to criticize Macron’s comments, arguing during a debate on Ukraine at the National Assembly that “sharing (nuclear) deterrence is equivalent to abolishing it” on Monday. She added: “unleashing the nuclear fire cannot be separated from national and popular legitimacy,” which is vested solely in the French president, elected by universal suffrage. In response, Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu said that France’s nuclear deterrent would remain the prerogative of the president. “Weapons production ... and use of nuclear forces are French and will stay French,” Lecornu said Monday. “While the hand on the button remains that of the head of state ... the fact remains that the way in which we contribute to the continent’s global security architecture is a proper debate,” Lecornu told French lawmakers. All European capitals “are going to ask us the question, so we want to be ready to answer.”",Macron to discuss nuclear deterrence with European allies.

While no decision has been made, anonymous sources toldBloombergthat the government of Panama is weighing the possibility of canceling the contracts. President JosÃ© RaÃºl Mulino has not yet commented on the matter. The development comesafter Rubio's visit to Panama, where he told President Mulino that steps must be taken to curb China's ""unacceptable"" influence over the US-built canal. Even though the Panama Canal is run by an autonomous entity overseen by the Panamanian government, the U.S. government claims China exerts influence through a Hong Kong-based company that operates ports on both ends of the waterway. ""People will argue, well, that's not China; that's a company based in Hong Kong. Well, a company based in Hong Kong is the Government of China. You are not a company in China if the Chinese Government doesn't control you,"" Rubio said in an interview with conservative journalistMegyn Kelly. ""If there's a conflict and China tells them 'do everything you can to obstruct the canal so that the U.S. can't engage in trade and commerce, so that the U.S. military and naval fleet cannot get to the Indo-Pacific fast enough'â		They would have to do it, and they would do it. And now we'd have a major problem on our hands,"" he added. During Rubio's visit, President Mulino announced that his government wouldwithdraw from China's signature lending program, Belt and Road Initiative, which finances infrastructure across several continents. The Panamanian leader added thatU.S. warships would be granted free passagethrough the canal, addressing a complaint by former President Donald Trump, who said the U.S. Navy was paying ""exorbitant"" rates to pass through. During his inauguration speech, Trump vowed to take back the Panama Canal. The president claimed that the U.S. has ""been treated very badly by this foolish gift that should have never been made,"" referring to an agreement with the Latin American country that would eventually lead to Panama retaining full control of the canal. He further claimed that ""China is controlling the Panama Canal"" and said, ""We're taking it back."" Trump has accused Panama of favoring China over the U.S. According toBloomberg, about 75% of the cargo transiting through the Panama Canal goes to or from the US, making it the biggest beneficiary of the route.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/04/2003832837,"US President Donald Trump’s confrontational policy toward China in his second term presents more of an opportunity for Taiwan than a threat, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) said. “The main focus of Trump’s second term is countering China,” Lin said during an interview on an online talk show hosted by a local political pundit that aired on Sunday night. Although countering China does not necessarily mean supporting Taiwan, the Trump administration’s stance gives Taiwan the opportunity to find common interests with the US, Lin said. “Taiwan’s foreign policy is not formulated on US interests, but is rather based on Taiwan’s interests,” he said. The government is finding common ground with Washington and focusing on promoting policies where the countries’ interests are aligned, he said. During his presidential campaign, Trump made controversial remarks about Taiwan, including accusing the nation of “stealing” the chip industry from the US decades ago, Lin said. Trump also repeatedly expressed frustration that Taipei does not pay the US to fund its defense, he added. Taiwan needs to take Trump’s words “seriously, but not literally,” Lin said. In response to Trump’s remarks, President William Lai (賴清德) last month announced that the government aimed to increase defense spending to 3 percent of GDP this year, the minister said. Lin said he is optimistic about the Trump administration’s foreign policy, as much of the Taiwan-US cooperation during the administration of former US president Joe Biden began during Trump’s first term from 2016 to 2020, and many senior members of Trump’s national security team are Taiwan friendly. “Trump 2.0 has so far shown more continuity in its policy than variability,” he said, adding that Trump’s second term is offering Taiwan “more opportunities than threats.” Meanwhile, asked about the US Department of State’s decision to remove from a bilateral relations fact sheet a line indicating Washington’s long-held stance of not supporting Taiwanese independence, and whether that means stronger support from Washington, Lin said he does not believe Taiwan needs to “overinterpret” the move. Taiwan needs to be more “practical” instead of overreacting to the wording in the fact sheet, he said. However, it is a good sign showing the need to move away from the Taiwan-US -China trilateral relationship framework established during the Cold War and view Taiwan-US and US-China relations separately so that Beijing does not have a say in Washington’s interactions with Taipei, he said.",US’ China policy offers opportunities: minister,"Staff writer, with CNA",Taipei Times,2025-03-04T00:00:00,2025-03-04T14:58:10,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-643086a6dc7ff716d876b3c83e3255b0,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trumplaunched a trade warTuesday against America’sthree biggest trading partners, drawing immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China and sending financial marketsinto a tailspinas the U.S. faced the threat of rekindled inflation and paralyzing uncertainty for business. Just after midnight, Trump imposed 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.

(AP Photo Bull) Beijing retaliatedwith tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. In an address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump repeated two different explanations for his tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He cited the trade deficits the U.S. has with both countries, but also said, “they’ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.” Trump also acknowledged there could be “a little disturbance” from the tariffs, a possible nod to the stock market’s sharp falls in the past two days as well as concerns about inflation. “It may be a little bit of an adjustment period,” he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. “You have to bear with me again and this will be even better.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his countrywould plaster tariffson over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days. “Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,” Trudeau said. President Trump imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday and doubled tariffs against imports from China. Here’s what you need to know about them. Later in the day, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would likely meet Canada and Mexico “in the middle,” with an announcement coming as soon as Wednesday. Lutnick told Fox Business Network that the tariffs would not be paused, but that Trump would reach a compromise. “I think he’s going to figure out, you do more, and I’ll meet you in the middle in some way,” Lutnick said. A Canadian senior government official said Lutnick called Ontario Premier Doug Ford after Ford’s press conference and asked him to stand down. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call, said Ford told the U.S. commerce secretary he’ll go harder. The official said Lutnick told Ford that Trudeau’s “very dumb” comment and remarks by other Canadian officials were not helpful, but said Lutnick seemed to acknowledge the tariffs are a part of negotiation toward a trade deal.

(Adrian Wyld  Canadian Press via AP) A senior Canadian official said Trudeau told the premiers of Canada’s provinces that he hopes to speak to Trump on Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum saidMexico will respondto the new taxes with its own retaliatory tariffs. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday. The delay might indicate that Mexico still hopes to de-escalate Trump’s trade war. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s blistering rejection of the Trump tariffs. China indicated on Tuesday night that it would not back down. “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” China’s embassy to the United States posted on X. The president is abandoning the free trade policies the United States pursued for decades after World War II. He argues that open trade cost America millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to national prosperity. He rejects the views of mainstream economists who contend that such protectionism is costly and inefficient. Import taxes are “a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,” Trump said Monday. “And now we’re using them.” Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin, author of a 2017 history of U.S. tariff policy, has calculated that Tuesday’s hikes will lift America’s average tariff from 2.4% to 10.5%, the highest level since the 1940s. “We’re in a new era for sure.” As the trade disputes escalated, stocksracked up more lossesTuesday on Wall Street, wiping out all the gains since Election Day for the S&P 500. Markets in Europe also fell sharply. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he will do next.

(Ethan Cairns  Canadian Press via AP) During his first term, Trumpimposed tariffsonly after lengthy investigations — into the national security implications of relying on foreign steel, for example, said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. But by declaring a national emergency involving the flow of immigrants and illicit drugs across U.S. borders, “he can modify these tariffs with a stroke of the pen,’’ House said. “It’s chaotic.” Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs. “Presidents don’t get to invent emergencies to justify bad policies,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Abusing emergency powers to wage an economic war on our closest allies isn’t leadership — it’s dangerous.” Even some Republican senators raised alarms. “Maine and Canada’s economy are integrated,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, explaining that much of the state’s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S. Truck driver Carlos Ponce, 58, went about business as usual Tuesday morning, transporting auto parts from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, just as he’s done for decades. Like many on the border, he was worried about the fallout from the tariffs. “Things could change drastically,” Ponce said. Truckers could lose their jobs or have to drive farther to coastal ports as Mexican manufacturers look for trading partners beyond the U.S. Alan Russell, head of Tecma, which helps factories set up in places like Ciudad Juarez, is skeptical that Trump’s tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the United States. “Nobody is going to move their factory until they have certainty,” Russell said. Just last week, he said, Tecma helped a North Carolina manufacturer that moved to Mexico because it couldn’t find enough workers in the United States.

(AP Photo Sancya, File) U.S. businesses near the Canadian border scrambled to deal with the impact. Gutherie Lumber in suburban Detroit reached out Tuesday to Canadian suppliers about the cost of 8-foot wood studs. About 15% of the lumber at the Gutherie yard in Livonia, Michigan, comes from Canada. Sales manager Mike Mahoney said Canadian suppliers are already raising prices. “They’re putting that 25% on studs.’’ Builders will strain to stay within their budgets. After years of effort and thousands of dollars in investment, Tom Bard, a Kentucky craft bourbon distiller, gained a foothold in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta and watched his sales grow north of the border. Now Kentucky bourbon is in Canada’s crosshairs, and an order from his Canadian distributors is on hold. “That hurts,” he said. At his small distillery “every single pallet that goes out the door makes a huge difference ... The last thing you want is to have an empty spot where your bottles are supposed to be on a shelf.” Bard co-owns the Bard Distillery with his wife, Kim, in western Kentucky’s Muhlenberg County, about 135 miles (217 kilometers) southwest of Louisville, Kentucky. Trump overwhelmingly carried Kentucky in the November election. In Muhlenberg County, Trump defeated Kamala Harris by a more than 3-to-1 margin. The China tariffs also threaten the U.S. toy industry. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be “crippling,” as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250304009100320?section=national/diplomacy,"SEJONG, March 4 (Yonhap) -- South Korea and the United States have agreed to launch working-level consultative bodies on promoting bilateral cooperation in shipbuilding and energy industries, as well as for discussions on Washington's new tariff scheme, Seoul's industry minister said Tuesday. South Korea is the first country to form working-level consultative bodies with the new U.S. administration on tariff negotiations and bilateral cooperation, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said in a press briefing on his recent visit to Washington, noting the channels will begin operation as soon as possible. The two sides plan to establish four different channels to discuss shipbuilding collaboration, energy cooperation, which includes South Korea's possible participation in the Alaska liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, tariffs and non-tariff barriers.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) The agreement was made during Ahn's three-day trip to Washington last week, where he met with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, as well as U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer and U.S. Secretary of Interior and National Energy Dominance Council Chairman Doug Burgum among others to discuss the Donald Trump administration's new tariff scheme. Ahn's trip came amid mounting concerns over the U.S. government's plan to impose 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, as well as to introduce reciprocal tariffs on trade partners while reviewing new tariffs on cars, chips and pharmaceuticals. ""Opening a negotiation channel with the U.S. was the priority of the trip as we are not playing a single-round match with the U.S. but rather a marathon,"" Ahn said. Ahn said he focused on emphasizing the fact that the South Korean economy has increasingly decoupled from China in recent years while sharply deepening industrial ties with the U.S. that included massive corporate investments in America. ""We told officials that South Korean companies' investments have only started, and there are many more to come, and for them to be carried out as planned, consistency in U.S. policies is needed,"" he said.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) The minister said he also conveyed South Korea's interest in participating in the gas pipeline development project in Alaska, one of the Trump administration's key agendas, as part of efforts to increase energy imports from the U.S. and thus reduce its trade surplus. Washington's trade officials also welcomed Ahn's proposal that Korean shipbuilders can manufacture warships, tankers and icebreakers for the U.S. on a preferential basis as part of measures to bolster bilateral cooperation in the shipbuilding industry, he added. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)",S.

https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/03/trump-zelenskyy-do-over-00209494,"President Donald Trump on Monday evening hit pause on all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, a show of force following last week’s dressing down of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office aimed at pressuring him back to the negotiating table. “President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace,” a White House official told POLITICO. “We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.” That directive came just hours after Trump told reporters that he’d yet to even discuss such a pause — and three days after the president’s remarkable berating of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Trump and Vice President JD Vance took issue with what they said was a lack of gratitude by Ukraine’s president who, as Trump put it to his face, doesn’t “have the cards” to prevail over Russia without continued assistance from the U.S. But Trump also made clear in public comments Monday that the economic agreement Zelenskyy had come to Washington to finalize remains on the table. The carrot and stick approach is about forcing Zelenskyy into a bigger negotiation to end the war with Russia. One administration official close to the process, granted anonymity to discuss internal matters, said that Trump and his senior team continue to believe that a relatively quick end to the war that Russia started three years ago remains possible and are eager to push Zelenskyy to tamp down his own rhetoric so they can draw both sides into negotiating. “There’s a potential window with Russia,” the official said. “You won’t get Putin to the table if you call him names.” But as much as Trump may want to broker a historic peace, his own ego remains a factor. On Monday, some aides continued to suggest that there would be no deal, no matter the high stakes, until Zelenskyy took ownership for Friday’s flap. “What we need to hear from President Zelenskyy is that he has regret for what happened, he’s ready to sign this minerals deal and that he’s ready to engage in peace talks,” said Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz during an appearance on Fox News Channel on Monday. Significant barriers remain to rescuing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. They include demands that Zelenskyy, though viewed as a victim by allies in Europe and many in the U.S., apologize to Trump. And it is becoming increasingly clear that even if Zelenskyy swallows his pride and apologizes to Trump for perceived insults, the profit-sharing deal on rare earth minerals is unlikely to lead immediately to peace talks or to deter Trump from drawing closer to Russia. Still, administration officials worked over the weekend to hold backchannel conversations to rescue the deal, while allies publicly urged Zelenskyy to make a public show of begging for forgiveness. And Trump, despite his strong anti-Zelenskyy rhetoric, left just enough daylight in his comments Monday to keep European and Ukrainian hopes alive. Pro-Ukraine lawmakers, increasingly swimming against a tide of Republican opposition to Zelenskyy and the war, are working to repair the situation. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a pro-Ukraine moderate, expressed confidence following a conversation with Zelenskyy’s chief of staff that the minerals pact would be worked out “in short order” and lead to longer-term economic and security agreements. “We are 100% getting this train back on the tracks,” Fitzpatrick wrote in a post on X. In his own remarks Monday afternoon, the president also struck a much more conciliatory posture than he conveyed Friday and even earlier Monday, when he blasted Zelenskyy on social media. During a back-and-forth with reporters in the Roosevelt Room, Trump talked up the benefits of a deal to split profits with Ukraine for the country’s rare earth minerals and tempered his attacks on Zelenskyy. “I just think he should be more appreciative because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin,” Trump said. Trump ducked a question about whether he’s discussed canceling additional defense aid for Ukraine, reiterated the security benefits for Kyiv of an American presence there and praised European leaders for expressing a willingness to increase defense spending. Just hours after attacking Zelenskyy over a comment suggesting the war’s end was “very, very far away,” Trump eased up, questioning whether the remark was accurate and not naming Zelenskyy as he urged him toward peace talks. But Trump is hardly in Zelenskyy’s or Europe’s camp. And his eagerness to build a relationship with Moscow is putting pressure on Europe. Asked whether talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin were in the offing, Trump said on Monday that “we’re going to do deals with everybody.” Lawmakers from both parties expressed concern about Trump’s move on Monday evening. “Too bad Iran, North Korea and China are not pausing their military aid and economic support,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told POLITICO. “There is an invader and a victim, there is a democracy and a dictatorship, there is a country who wants to be part of the West and one who hates the West. We should be unambiguously for the good side.” Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters that Trump’s decision comes at a critical time for Ukraine on the battlefield. “I do not think we should be pausing our efforts,” she said. “It’s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood.” The looming prospect of Trump’s reconciliation with Putin is giving greater urgency to European efforts to draft their own plan to take a bigger role in protecting Ukraine if and when it reaches a deal to end the war. “Europe has a short amount of time to go all in and ensure a full rapprochement between the Americans and the Russians doesn’t happen,” said Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer in his Monday morning email to clients. “Otherwise, they are left without a realistic strategic option.” Bremmer also said there was chatter that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, both of whom came to Washington last week, might return in hopes of repairing ties, resurrecting the minerals deal and promoting a European cease-fire plan. But Trump’s interest in normalizing relations with Moscow could cloud these plans and prompt him to make more demands of Zelenskyy, whose country has been under attack from Russia for three years. Earlier Monday, Trump blasted Zelenskyy on social media, attacking his comments about the prospect of a longer war as “the worst statement that could have been made.” “This guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing,” Trump wrote. They were among many comments that echoed the Kremlin, so much so that Dmitiri Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, crowed in an interview with state television Sunday that America’s foreign policy “largely aligns with our vision.” Like Trump, he blamed Ukraine for dragging out the war that Russia launched without provocation three years ago. “The Kyiv regime and Zelenskyy do not want peace,” Peskov said. Zelenskyy sought to smooth that tension with his own social media post — aimed at Trump — emphasizing his desire for peace “as soon as possible.” Europe’s show of support for Zelenskyy this weekend and discussions of separate peace proposals made clear that he is not alone and may have sufficient backing to fend off Russian attacks for some time. But Trump and Vice President JD Vance’s berating of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday has riled the president’s political base, which could complicate any rapprochement with Ukraine’s president. The president’s political allies have celebrated his humiliation of Zelenskyy as in keeping with his “America First” mantra. And some have leaned in even harder, urging the president to abandon Ukraine and European allies altogether. Elon Musk, the tech billionaire Trump has empowered to slash the federal bureaucracy, called for the U.S. to withdraw completely from NATO, the alliance of 32 nations formed in the aftermath of World War II in a post on X, his social media company. And MAGA-oriented members of Congress, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rep. Ana Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), issued similar statements. But continuing to play to his own base could cost Trump the historic peacemaking opportunity he says he seeks. “Trump is driving Ukraine toward Europe. And it will take everything Europe’s got to keep them going,” said Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama. “But when you refuse to give them any security guarantees, when you insult them, you’re actually giving away your leverage. Because, like it or not, Ukraine is going to have a say in any peace deal.” Meredith Lee Hill, Nahal Toosi, Robbie Gramer and Dasha Burns contributed to this report.",Trump halts military aid to Ukraine,Eli Stokols,Politico,2025-03-03T19:17:24,2025-03-03T19:58:15,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250303-sudan-reels-as-us-suspends-aid-amid-ongoing-war,"Sudan has been hit hard by the United States' decision to suspend development aid to the poorest countries. The country has been plunged into a destructive war since April 2023. Despite this, the Trump administration intends to end the budget of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which it has currently suspended for 90 days. A critical freeze for this country.Â
The impact of the recent US decision to suspend humanitarian and development aid to the poorest countries is already being felt in Sudan. Many NGOs have expressed their opposition and concern over the US decision. According to the UN, thirty million people, more than half of the Sudanese population, are suffering from hunger and need emergency assistance. Global aid in chaos as Trump proposes to slash funds and dismantle USAID Community kitchens, launched by volunteers among the inhabitants, at the beginning of the war in 2023, are feeling a heavy impact. These kitchens initially relied on donations from the local society and the diaspora until they were able to benefit from aid allocated by international agencies that struggle to reach conflict zones. Their goal is to help those displaced by the war, in extreme need. With the cuts, they are facing major difficulties. The volunteers report the closure of a thousand of these kitchens. Therefore, two million people in an absolute food emergency, who benefited from this aid, no longer have access to it. According to some estimates from local workers gathered by RFI, American aid financed between 70 and 80 percent of the sum needed to operate these kitchens, but today the usual channels for receiving cash are no longer available. Now, some volunteers told RFI they buy products on credit from fishermen and producers in order to keep their kitchens running at a minimum. With no assurance of ever being able to repay the money borrowed. Over half the population faces high levels of acute food insecurity in Sudan, according to the UN. Famine conditions have been confirmed in five locations in North Darfur and the eastern Nuba mountains, and expected to spread to five more areas by May of this year. ""Conditions for millions of civilians in North Darfur have become catastrophic, and now humanitarians in Sudan are grappling with the abrupt cut in US funds which have crippled numerous life-saving aid operations"", according

https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/03/iran-confirms-its-nuclear-programme-was-discussed-between-us-and-russia,"Iran’s foreign ministry confirmed the country’s nuclear issue has been discussed by the US and Russia but said nothing will happen without Iranian involvement. 

""(Iran's nuclear issue) has been discussed (between Russia and the US) as an international issue, but what matters is that whatever is to be done about Iran's nuclear issue will definitely not be done without Iran's opinion,"" said the ministry’s spokesman Esmail Baghaei. “Our Russian friends are fully aware of that,” he said at a briefing on Monday. US and Russian officials hadbilateral talks in Februaryin their most extensive high-level engagement since Moscow launched it’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. After the meeting of the representatives from Moscow and Washington, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov visited Iran – sparking speculation that he briefed officials in Tehran about the talks with the US. Baghaei’s comments come on the same day that a former Iranian foreign minister key to the country's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers reportedly resigned from the government of reformist Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. That deal was an agreement to limit the Iranian nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief and other provisions. The resignation of Mohammad Javad Zarif signalled Tehran’s rapid retreat from its outreach to the West as US President Donald Trump intensifies sanctions on the country. The news comes after Iran’s parliament on Sundayimpeached Finance Minister Abdolnasser Hemmati, who once ran for the presidency signalling he’d be willing to talk to the US president directly. While lawmakers focused their criticism of Hemmati over Iran’s plummeting currency, his removal underscored the danger faced by Pezeshkian – who won the presidential election last year promising to reach out to the West to get sanctions lifted. Iran has accelerated its production of nearweapons-grade uranium, according to a report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog seen by The Associated Press. Iran says its programme is peaceful, but the US says Tehran has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.” Israel and the US have said they won’t allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons, threatening the possibility of further escalation after Tehran twice attacked Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",Iran confirms its nuclear programme was discussed between US and Russia,David O'Sullivan,Euronews,2025-03-03T18:29:33,2025-03-03T18:29:33,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-us-gallant-says-israel-needs-to-prioritize-hostages-return-over-resumption-of-war/,"Former defense minister Yoav Gallant tells an audience in New York that Israel needs to prioritize the release of the hostages in Gaza over resuming combat with Hamas, and that the country needs to carry out a commission of inquiry into the October 7, 2023 invasion. Gallant says at the ADL’s annual summit in New York City that he has spent hours with former Hamas hostages who told him that “the most important thing for them is to bring back their friends” still held captive. Resuming the war with Hamas before securing the release of the remaining hostages will mean “you won’t have hostages” left to save, says Gallant, who was defense minister at the time of the attack. “A bitter truth is even if we don’t want to fight Hamas we will fight them for a long period of time,” Gallant says. “First of all, bring the hostages, and then go and accomplish the job and Hamas will give us enough reason to do that.” Gallant advocates for a commission inquiry into Israel’s failings in preventing the Hamas onslaught. “The most important thing now is how to avoid any phenomena similar to what happened on October 7 in the future,” he says. “In order to do it, you have to learn the lessons and in order to learn the lessons you need to rebrief the Israeli actions.” “I think that our soldiers, our civilians, those who have been in the battlefield, those who were kidnapped and the wounded, people deserve all the answers and the answers have to be clear,” he says. “The only way is this committee that should be a national committee and I am the first one that is willing to step into the room and to give answers.”","In US, Gallant says Israel needs to prioritize hostages’ return over resumption of war",Luke Tress,The Times of Israel,2025-03-03T18:33:18,2025-03-03T20:09:50,gemini-2.0-flash

The Egyptian minister and his Jordanian counterpart, Ayman al-Safady, reiterated Monday both states' rejection to the displacement of Palestinians. They equally asserted the salience of concerting regional and international efforts to ensure the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, as a first step on the pathway of establishing a Palestinian state on the borders of June 4, 1967 having as capital Eastern Jerusalem.  
	 
The Egyptian minister met Sunday his Iraqi counterpart, Fouad Hussein, expressing support to Iraq's security and stability, and keenness on fully implementing bilateral projects, and trilateral projects with Jordan.
	 
The Egyptian and Iraqi ministers also conferred over the updates in Syria, so as Abdelatty underscored Egypt's support to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, launching an inclusive political process that would lead up to elections, and combating terrorism and extremism for Syria not to become a source of instability in the region.
	 
Minister Abdelatty met Monday his Yemeni counterpart, Shaea Mohsen al-Zandani, underlining Egypt's backing to the unity of Yemen, independence, territorial integrity and state institutions. The minister pointed out that Yemen's security and stability are essential to guarantee security in the Middle East and Red Sea.
	 
The Egyptian minister also expressed support to endeavors aimed at achieving a political solution to the rift in Yemen, as it will equally end the humanitarian suffering in the country. In a related context, Abdelatty shed light on the food and medical supplies Egypt has granted to Yemen, in addition to hosting large numbers of Yemenis providing them with basic services.
	 
The Egyptian minister met Palestinian Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohamed Mostafa to discuss hosting another conference - in partnership with the United Nations - on Gaza reconstruction. The two sides also exchanged views on updates in the enclave and ongoing Israeli violence in the West Bank.
	 
Minister Abdelatty stressed to his Tunisian counterpart, Mohamed Ali al-Nafty, the necessity of maintaining the regularity of holding meetings among joint specialized committees in order to preserve the recent growth of relations.
	 
Similarly, bilateral relations were the major topic in the meeting of the Egyptian minister and his Bahraini counterpart, Abdel Latif Bin Rashed al-Zayani, as the former stressed the importance of expanding cooperation in various fields, and coordination on regional issues.
	 
The meeting of Minister Abdelatty and his Mauritanian counterpart, Mohamed Salem Ould Merzoug, also focused on reinforcing collaboration in different sectors, so as the former expressed aspiration to convening a supreme joint committee to agree on certain plans, mainly concerning trade and economic aspects.

https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-starmer-trump-b025877c40ffe0ddf2a92adad1715231,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia “is still very, very far away,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, adding that he believed Ukraine’s long-term partnership with the U.S. was strong enough that American support would continue despite recent fraught relations with U.S. President Donald Trump. “I think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it’s more than an occasional relationship,” Zelenskyy said late Sunday, referring to Washington’s support for the past three years of war. “I believe that Ukraine has a strong enough partnership with the United States of America” to keep aid flowing, he said at a briefing in Ukrainian before leaving London. Zelenskyy publicly was upbeat despite the recent heated Oval Office blow up with Trump and Vice President JD Vance during which they accused him of being “disrespectful” and said he should show more gratitude for America’s help. The turn of events is unwelcome for Ukraine, whose understrength army is having a hard time keep bigger Russian forces at bay. The Ukrainian leader was in London to attend U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s effort to rally his European counterparts around continuing — and likely much increased — support for Ukraine from the continent amid political uncertainty in the U.S., and Trump’s overtures toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. Asked by a reporter to comment about the outlines of a new European initiative to end Russia’s war, Zelenskyy said: “We are talking about the first steps today, and therefore, until they are on paper, I would not like to talk about them in great detail.” “An agreement to end the war is still very, very far away, and no one has started all these steps yet. The peace that we foresee in the future must be just, honest, and most importantly, sustainable,” he added. Trump slammed Zelenskyy later Monday for suggesting that the end of Russia’s war against Ukraine is still far off. “This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. — Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia,” Trump added in his post. “What are they thinking?” The White House wants Zelenskyy to show more openness to potential concessions in order to bring the fighting to an end, but Zelenskyy resisted that idea while pressing for security guarantees from Washington during last Friday’s meeting. Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next leader after the recent election, said Monday that he didn’t think last Friday’s Oval Office blow-up was spontaneous. He said that he had watched the scene repeatedly. “My assessment is that it wasn’t a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but apparently an induced escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,” Merz said. He said that he was “somewhat astonished by the mutual tone,” but there has been “a certain continuity to what we are seeing from Washington at the moment” in recent weeks. “I would advocate for us preparing to have to do a great, great deal more for our own security in the coming years and decades,” he said. Even so, Merz said that he wanted to keep the trans-Atlantic relationship alive. “I would also advocate doing everything to keep the Americans in Europe,” he said. ___ Geir Moulson contributed to this report from Berlin. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at ","Ukraine's Zelenskyy says end of war with Russia is 'very, very far away'",Illia Novikov,AP News,2025-03-03T13:54:55,2025-03-03T14:08:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/man-stabbed-to-death-in-suspected-terror-attack-at-haifa-bus-terminal/,"An Israeli man was killed and at least four others were wounded in a terrorist attack at a major Haifa transit hub Monday, authorities said. The assailant, an Israeli Druze citizen, was shot and killed. His family said he suffered from mental illness. The knife attack at the northern city’s Lev Hamifratz bus station was the latest in a string of terror attacks targeting public transportation in Israel, after a ramming attack at a bus stop on Thursday and a series of botched bus bombings near Tel Aviv a week earlier. The attacker, identified by police as an Israeli citizen from the Druze community, was shot and killed by a bus station security guard and an armed passerby. Hebrew outlets named him as Jethro Shahin, a man in his 20s. Unconfirmed reports claimed he held German citizenship. Family members denied he had a terror motive and said he had suffered from mental illness. Reports said he was known to Israeli welfare services. The victim was identified in reports as Hassan Karim Dahamsheh, a 70-year-old resident of Kafr Kanna, an Arab town in the Galilee. According to police, the assailant stabbed Dahamsheh in the back several times, killing him. Four others were wounded, including a 15-year-old boy rushed to Haifa’s Rambam Medical Center with life-threatening injuries. The hospital said the teen was stable after undergoing emergency surgery. Three others, including a woman in her 70s and a man and woman in their 30s, were hospitalized with moderate wounds, health officials said. Graphic video of the attack captured by a surveillance camera showed the victim attempting to reach a security booth as the stabbing apparently began. The assailant then rushes the man, tackling him to the ground and repeatedly knifing him until a guard and another man shoot the attacker. Warning: Graphic footage An eyewitness told the Walla outlet that the stabber got off a bus from Shfar’am that pulled into the station, shouted “Allahu Akbar” and began stabbing those around him. Police said the assailant was a Druze citizen of Israel from Shfar’am, who returned to Israel a week ago after spending several months abroad. Israel Police chief Daniel Levy said forces were working to verify that the attacker had acted alone. Reports said that police raided the home of the suspected assailant and were questioning his family. He reportedly had no criminal record. Shfar’am Mayor Nahad Hazem told the Kan public broadcaster that two of those injured were from his city, one of them a relative of his own office director. “It is a heinous crime, and I completely condemn it,” Hazem said. MK Hamed Amar, a Druze lawmaker from the right-wing Yisrael Beytenu party said the attack did not represent the Druze community in Israel, which is largely integrated into society. He described the suspected assailant as a “terrorist with German citizenship who was born and lived in Germany.” “Such an act of terrorism is contrary to every moral and human value and certainly does not reflect the loyal spirit of the Druze community in Israel, which is a full partner in defending the state and its values,” said Amar, who hails from Shfaram. However, relatives denied Shahin was a terrorist, saying that he had struggled with mental illness. “I am a disabled IDF veteran and his other uncle is a reserve soldier. We have nothing in our family hostile to the state,” the attacker’s uncle Roni Kharis told the Ynet news site. The forum of the heads of the Druze and Circassian authorities put out a statement saying it “stands united and determined against any attempt to harm the security of Israeli citizens.” “We are certain that the identity of the attacker and his mental condition will soon become clear, and that the attacker is likely of German origin,” the statement read. Acting National Security Minister Haim Katz held a situation assessment after the attack, which occurred at a central transit hub for buses and trains linking northern Israel to Tel Aviv. “The days ahead are challenging,” Katz said in a statement. He said police and emergency services are on “high readiness” and urged the public to be alert for any potential dangers. The stabbing came after a car-ramming attack Thursday at a bus stop at Karkur Junction outside the city of Pardes Hanna that injured 13 people, including a teen hospitalized in critical condition. The suspect in that attack, identified as a Palestinian from the Jenin area of the West Bank who was living in Israel illegally with his Arab Israeli wife, was shot and killed while attempting to stab police officers after fleeing the scene, police said at the time. The Karkur Junction attack came a week after three empty buses exploded in quick succession in parking lots in the Tel Aviv suburbs of Bat Yam and Holon, followed by the discovery of two more unexploded devices on additional buses, in what appeared to be a botched terror attack. No casualties were reported as a result of the explosions.",Man stabbed to death in terror attack at Haifa bus terminal,"Charlie Summers, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-03-03T11:26:07,2025-03-03T18:10:04,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/china-congress-legislature-5cf899bfc9d4705135d9dd56c8dc5212,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s annual major political event gets underway this week, bringing together the nation’s top leaders and thousands of provincial leaders to endorse decisions already made by the all-powerful Chinese Communist Party. The meetings and gathering during the National People’s Congress, expected to last for about a week, are still important. The rubber-stamp parliament retains an important function: to signal the priorities of the government for the coming year and to disseminate instructions to party members and officials across the country. The messaging from leadership appears unchanged from previous years — stay the course on fostering innovation while also spurring domestic consumption. The question will be how they balance those two goals, and will it be enough to reinvigorate the economy? And to what extent will the government buffer the impact of what might be another phase in the U.S.-China trade war? This year also marks the end of China’s current 5-year plan, and experts will be looking for clues on the government’s priorities for the next, 2026 to 2030 plan. Here is what to watch for at this year’s event: What is China’s economic growth target? The National People’s Congress kicks off on Wednesday, with Premier Li Qiang, China’s top economic official, announcing the economic growth target for the year. Analysts expect it to come in at around 5% – holding the same target as the previous two years, and slightly lower than the 5.5% target in 2022. This would be no small feat considering China is still grappling with a sluggish real estate sector and lackluster consumer spending. Another uncertainty is trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump, who last month slapped a 10% tariff on Chinese imports while an additional 10% comes into effect on Tuesday. Forecasters at the International Monetary Fund are projecting a lower 4.6% growth rate this year. What are the government’s priorities? A commentary last Friday from the official Xinhua News Agency indicated that priority would be placed on boosting domestic demand and promoting innovation in science and technology. There’s also anticipation of more government support for the private sector to fuel growth. Chinese President Xi Jinping met in February with business leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, signaling support for the private sector at the highest level of leadership. A draft bill is also to be deliberated during the Congress over making a fairer and more equitable business environment for the private sector. China has already released a slew of measures to prop up the economy. Much of these have fallen short of hopes for a bigger stimulus, and analysts are tempering expectations on what to expect from the Congress. “I would not expect anything ... to come out that will really meaningfully shift that policy away from industrial policy and towards boosting consumption in meaningful, sufficient ways,” said Jacob Gunter, lead analyst for the economics research team at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. Instead, experts say leaders are staying the course on pushing for innovation that would boost China’s self-reliance. The purpose of the economy is no longer to improve household incomes and expand the middle class, Gunter said. “This is not a development-oriented economy,” he said. “It’s a geopolitically oriented economy, and technology and industry are way more important for that.” Where is China’s diplomacy headed? Li is expected to touch on foreign policy and Taiwan, but more attention will likely be on Foreign Minister Wang Yi. His annual news conference, to be held later in the week, will be closely watched to decipher China’s stance on U.S.-China relations under Trump. After the first 10% tariffs in February, China retaliated with a 15% tariff on American coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as 10% on crude oil, agriculture machinery and large-engine cars. “Beijing’s response to Trump’s initial 10% tariffs was measured — restrained enough to signal openness to negotiations yet firm enough to demonstrate its willingness to escalate if necessary,” Neil Thomas and Jing Qian wrote in a report for the Asia Society Policy Institute. They note that China’s president might use speeches in closed-door meetings during the Congress to send signals on bilateral relations, as he did two years ago when Xi named the United States as leading “containment encirclement and suppressions” against China. Also closely watched will be China’s relations with Russia and its position on the Ukraine war. At a recent Group of 20 foreign minister’s meeting in South Africa, Wang said a “window for peace is opening” in Ukraine, and that China supported “all efforts committed to peace, including the recent consensus reached by the United States and Russia.” What does the National People’s Congress do? The legislature is made up of nearly 3,000 delegates from China’s provinces, ministries, People’s Liberation Army, party organizations and various groups that represent workers and other interests. Their role is largely ceremonial in that the body does not have any real power to decide on legislation. Any vote is usually unanimous or near-unanimous to formalize decisions already taken by Communist Party leaders behind closed doors. Still, the Congress is a rare opportunity to see what the central government’s sees as priorities and goals, and the reports and speeches during it can give indications of the future direction of government policy. An advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, will meet at the same time. Members include business leaders, athletes, academics, religious leaders and representatives of ethnic groups. The concurrent meetings of the two bodies are known as the Two Sessions.",What to watch for at China’s National People's Congress this week,Emily Wang Fujiyama,AP News,2025-03-03T09:15:13,2025-03-03T20:56:43,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-britain-zelenskyy-europe-starmer-trump-russia-b980170ead74a1a7914c565f14ee6cc9,"LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rallied his European counterparts Sunday to shore up their borders and throw their full weight behind Ukraine as he announced outlines of a plan to end Russia’s war. “Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can, bringing different capabilities and support to the table, but all taking responsibility to act, all stepping up their own share of the burden,” he said. Starmer’s exhortation to 18 fellow leaders that they need to do the heavy lifting for their own security comes two days after U.S. backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy whenPresident Donald Trump lashed outat Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and saidhe wasn’t grateful enough for America’s support. The meeting had been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding that took place on live television at the White House. Starmer used the opportunity as part of his broader effort to bridge the gap between Europe and the U.S. and also salvage what had seemed like the start of a peace process before Friday’s spat. Starmer said he had worked with France and Ukraine on a plan to end the war and that the group of leaders — mostly from Europe — had agreed on four things. The steps toward peace would: keep aid flowing to Kyiv and maintain economic pressure on Russia to strengthen Ukraine’s hand; make sure Ukraine is at the bargaining table and any peace deal must ensure its sovereignty and security; and continue to arm Ukraine to deter future invasion. Finally, Starmer said they would develop a “coalition of the willing” to defend Ukraine and guarantee the peace. “Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can’t mean that we sit back,” he said. “Instead, those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency. The U.K. is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others.” It is far from certain whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will accept any such plan, which Starmer said would require strong U.S. backing. He did not specify what that meant, though he told the BBC before the summit that there were “intense discussions” to get a security guarantee from the U.S. “If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then Putin comes again,” Starmer said. Starmer said he will later bring a more formal plan to the U.S. and work with Trump. Before arriving in London, French president Emmanuel Macron suggested in an interview with a French newspaper that he and Starmer are proposing a “truce in the air, on the seas and energy infrastructures” that would last a month. There would be no European troops in the coming weeks and troops would only be deployed on the ground at a later stage, he said. The question, Macron said, is “how we use this time to try and get an accessible truce, with negotiations that will take several weeks and then, once peace is signed, a deployment.” Europe has been anxious since Trump initiated direct peace talks with Putin, who had been isolated by most Western leaders since invading Ukraine three years ago. Thescramble to remain relevantand protect European interests as their once stalwart ally appeared to be cozying up to Putin was even more troubling when Trumpcalled Zelenskyy a dictatorand falsely said Ukraine started the war. Meetings last week had provided some hope — until Zelenskyy’s trip to the White House on Friday. Visits to the Oval Office by Starmer and Macron, who had declared his visit a “turning point,” were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine, though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees and maintained that Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops. Within 12 hours of Starmer’s return from Washington, the talk of peace seemed to collapse as Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy for challenging Trump’s assertions that Putin could be trusted. During his Sunday press conference, Starmer rejected the suggestion that the U.S. was no longer a reliable ally. “There are no two countries as closely aligned as our two countries and our defense, our security and intelligence is intertwined in a way no two other countries are, so it’s an important and reliable ally for us,” he said. Starmer told the BBC before the summit that he does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin but does trust Trump. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said she was sorry for what happened with Zelenskyy in Washington. Meloni is both a strong Ukraine supporter and — as head of a far-right party — she is a natural ally of Trump. She was the only European leader to attend his inauguration. She said told reporters following the meeting that Europe must remain focused on its common goals and that “dividing the West would be disastrous for everyone.” “We need to work to reinforce our unity, and I think that Italy can play a role, not just in its own interest, but in everyone’s,” she said. “I don’t want to take any other scenario into consideration.” Starmer hosted the meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace, following his charm offensive with Macron to persuade Trump to put Ukraine at the center of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe. Leaders from Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania were at the summit. The Turkish foreign minister, the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council were also in attendance. Starmer used sweeping terms to describe the challenge ahead, saying Europe was at a crossroads in its history and needed to step up to meet “once in a generation moment.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen emerged from the meeting and said she would present a plan to “rearm Europe” to bolster the bloc’s security after a long period of underinvestment. As for the future of war-torn Ukraine, von der Leyen said it needs security guarantees. “We have to put Ukraine in a position of strength so that it has the means to fortify itself and to protect itself,” von der Leyen said. “It’s basically turning Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders.” Last week, Starmer pledged to boost military spendingto 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027. Other European nations may follow suit. Starmer pledged to supply more arms to defend Ukraine, announcing that the U.K. will use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export financing to supply 5,000 air defense missiles. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London, Colleen Barry in Milan, Karel Janicek in Prague and Samuel Petrequin contributed.",Starmer says Europe is at ‘crossroads in history’ as leaders agree to steps to Ukraine peace,"Brian Melley, Emma Burrows",AP News,2025-03-02T05:01:32,2025-03-03T03:51:33,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rferl.org/a/abkhazia-georgia-russia-gunba-presidential-election/33333928.html,"Kremlin-favored candidate Badra Gunba won the presidential runoff in Abkhazia, a Russian-backed breakaway region that legally is a part of Georgia, de facto election authorities said on March 2. Gunba, 47, failed to secure an outright majority in the first round on February 15, forcing the runoff against Adgur Ardzinba, a challenger critical of some Russian-backed economic policies. Authorities said Gunbawon almost 55 percent of the vote, while Ardzinba received 41.5 percent, and 2 percent voted against all, although there was no way to confirm the authenticity of the figures. Turnout was reported at 70 percent. In the first round, Gunba won 46.3 percent, while Ardzinba finished with 36.9 percent. Gunba, who previously served as vice president, took over as acting leader on November 19 after Aslan Bzhania resigned amid mass protests against an investment deal with Russia. Opponents feared the agreement threatened Abkhazia's already fragile status under Russian control. Ardzinba, a former de facto economy minister (2015â		20) and leader of the Abkhaz People's Movement, ran on a platform opposing the deal, though he still pledged close ties with Moscow. Russian pro-government media attempted to frame him as ""pro-Turkish."" The investment agreement aimed to strengthen economic ties between the breakaway region and Russia but was met with widespread opposition. Critics, including opposition figures and civil society groups, labeled the deal ""exploitative,"" claiming it would give undue advantages to Russian investors while undermining Abkhaziaâ		9s sovereignty. The deal was later rejected by the region's de facto legislature. Georgia's Foreign Ministry has denounced the ""so-called presidential elections in Russian-occupied Abkhazia,"" urging international condemnation of Moscow's ongoing violations. The EU reiterated its support for Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty in a statement following the first round, saying it does not recognize the constitutional and legal framework in which the ""so-called presidential elections in Abkhazia"" took place. ""The European Union recalls its firm support for the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders,""a statement said. TheGeorgian governmenton March 1 stated that the ""illegally"" held election ""contradicts fundamental principles of international law and represents another gross violation of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders."" Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke away from Georgia's rule after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. While Russia recognized Abkhazia's independence after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, most international community still views the region as part of Georgia. Though the territory is politically and economically dependent on Russia, some Abkhazians have been critical of what they see as Moscow's growing influence. Moscow welcomed Gunba's candidacy and his eventual victory. Just days before the first round, on February 7, Russia carried out a test flight from Moscow Vnukovo Airport to the long-defunct Sukhumi Babushara Airport, bringing Gunba amid passengers and pledging to establish regular air connections later this year. Gunba met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak. To bolster his position, Moscow announced the resumption of financial aid -- suspended since September -- and increased electricity supplies amid severe shortages. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Gunba following the election, according to the Kremlin press service. ""I expect that the friendly, allied Russian-Abkhazian relations will continue to strengthen for the benefit of our brotherly nations,"" a statement read.

https://www.politico.eu/article/china-could-blackmail-germany-via-wind-turbines-government-linked-report-warns/,"BRUSSELS — Germany’s political system and social cohesion are at stake unless it restricts Chinese wind turbines in the country, a government-backed analysis seen by POLITICO warns. The report, which the German defense ministry commissioned, argues Beijing could purposefully delay projects, harvest sensitive data and remotely shut down turbines if given access to wind farms. It also advises the country to stop an existing wind project using Chinese turbines from going ahead. “When using systems or components from Chinese manufacturers … given the political situation, it can even be assumed that such a slowdown or even disruption would be deliberately used by China as a means of political pressure or even as an instrument of economic warfare,” reads the report, prepared last month by the German Institute for Defense and Strategic Studies think tank.  “A destabilization of both the political system, the business model of German industry and social cohesion cannot therefore be ruled out due to a lack of or insufficient planning security in the energy sector,” it adds. The analysis comes amid growing concerns related to critical infrastructure risks in Europe. Since 2022, at least six separate incidents of suspected underwater sabotage have taken place in the Baltic Sea.  Meanwhile, Brussels has begun cracking down on Chinese wind suppliers after suspecting them of receiving state subsidies to beat out European competitors for European Union projects. Last year, the European Commission, the EU's executive, opened a probe into Beijing-linked wind projects in Bulgaria, France, Greece, Romania and Spain. Now those risks are likely to increase if ties worsen with Beijing, according to Andrea Scassola, vice president of wind research at the Rystad consultancy.  “What we are seeing … is intensifying great power rivalry, and at a time when our world is more interconnected than it has ever been — it’s a magnifier of vulnerability and risks,” he said. Overdependence on China also raises the risk of cyberattacks that could “lead to a shutdown of production,” Scassola said, adding that similar public warnings or legal moves to restrict Beijing’s access have already taken place in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Poland and Lithuania. The report makes similar warnings. If relations sour with China, Beijing could delay the operation of new farms by “at least four to five years” between the planning approval and commissioning stages, the analysis reads, and could coordinate other disruptive efforts with Russia.  Part of the danger also comes from the access that manufacturers get to turbines, according to the study. Beijing’s suppliers would have access to computer programs that control active turbines and collect data from hundreds of radars built into farms, it states — a significant issue given that wind produced a third of Germany’s electricity last year and a fifth of the EU’s power. In sum, the report argues, that would hand China “considerable blackmail potential in the future.” Germany’s defense ministry and the German Institute for Defense and Strategic Studies declined to comment on the report.  Public safety issue Despite the warnings, Germany has already begun eyeing Chinese firms as potential suppliers.  Last year, project developer Luxcara announced it had selected Beijing’s Ming Yang Smart Energy to supply 16 turbines for its “Waterkant” offshore wind farm in northwest Germany.  The report warns that the “first time use of Chinese wind turbines must be prevented” on “public safety” grounds, since it risks creating a reliance on Beijing’s expertise and giving it access to “essential elements of German critical infrastructure” near militarily relevant training areas. That’s not the first time the Chinese manufacturing giant’s overtures to Europe have come under scrutiny. Ming Yang supplied 10 turbines for an offshore wind farm in southern Italy that was completed in 2022; Britain’s investment minister also met with the company in December to discuss its business prospects in the U.K., POLITICO revealed last week. Germany’s wind industry is wary of the Waterkant project, too. Local turbine makers see projects with Beijing’s products as a “massive risk,” said Karina Würtz, managing director of the German Offshore Wind Energy Foundation, while acknowledging that projects like Waterkant face “threats to [their] commercial viability” if Chinese suppliers withdraw. Berlin must now “investigate into that risk, honestly and in-depth,” she said, and push ahead with enforcing EU laws like the 2023 NIS2 directive, which includes measures to mitigate cybersecurity threats, as soon as a new government is formed after the Feb. 23 election. The report, meanwhile, suggests that Berlin explore legal tools like its national procurement law and Wind Energy at Sea Act to exclude Chinese firms from contracts on defense or public safety grounds.  Ming Yang did not respond to questions sent by POLITICO. Luxcara declined to comment.","China could blackmail Germany via wind turbines, report warns",Victor Jack,POLITICO,2025-03-02T23:20:00,2025-03-02T23:21:44,gemini-2.0-flash

The three neighbors are in the final stages of arranging talks among their foreign ministers on March 22 in Tokyo, the first such meeting in 16 months, according to the diplomatic sources. On the sidelines of the trilateral talks, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, are expected to hold a separate meeting. Seoul and Beijing have been discussing Wang's visit to South Korea on the occasion of his Tokyo trip, but it reportedly remains unclear whether he will visit South Korea. If no progress is made, Cho and Wang are likely to hold talks in the Japanese capital. The meeting, if held, would mark the first since September last year when they met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. A number of diplomatic issues between the two countries could be discussed during the meeting. After Cho and his U.S. and Japanese counterparts expressed joint ""support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in appropriate international organizations"" in a joint statement last month, China lodged a complaint, calling it interference with its sovereignty. The meeting could also delve into the tariff increases by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, anti-Chinese sentiment among South Korea's conservative forces and a potential visit to South Korea's ancient city of Gyeongju by Chinese President Xi Jinping for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November. pbr@yna.co.kr(END)","FMs of S.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78ejpvdlezo,"The government of Haiti says police have launched a large-scale operation in a shantytown controlled by powerful gang leader Jimmy Chérizier, who is widely known as Barbecue. The authorities say several gang members have been killed in the Lower Delmas area of the capital Port-au-Prince. Local reports say military drones carrying explosives are being used in the operation. Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé praised the assault. He said it was the work of a special task force created two days ago to tackle insecurity. Chérizier, aged 47, is the feared leader of Viv Ansam (Live Together), a coalition of gangs that control much of the city. It is not clear whether Kenyan police officers deployed in Haiti last year to help fight the gangs are involved in the security operation. Last week, a Kenyan police officer - who was on patrol with the Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support mission - was killed in a confrontation with gang members. Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-halts-aid-into-gaza-over-hamas-refusal-to-extend-first-phase-of-truce/,"ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 573 Israel said Sunday it would not allow any more goods to enter Gaza over what it called Hamas’s refusal to accept a proposal to extend the expiring initial stage of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, and threatened “additional consequences” and a return to war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government said the move had rock-solid backing from US President Donald Trump’s White House, even as Jerusalem appeared to back away from its previous agreement with Hamas to negotiate a second phase of the ceasefire during which additional hostages would be released and Israel would fully withdraw from Gaza. “With the end of phase one of the hostage deal and in light of Hamas’s refusal to accept the [US special envoy Steve] Witkoff outline for continuing talks – to which Israel agreed – Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement Sunday morning. “Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages,” the PMO added, threatening “further consequences” if Hamas continues to say no to the proposal. It later denied a report in Arabic-language media that Netanyahu had dispatched a delegation to Egypt for talks. Netanyahu also claimed at his weekly cabinet meeting that Hamas is diverting aid entering the Strip for its own use. “Hamas is currently taking control of all supplies and goods sent to the Gaza Strip. It is abusing the Gazan population who are trying to receive the aid, it is shooting at them, and is turning humanitarian aid into a terrorist budget directed against us,” he said. According to the Kan public broadcaster, Israel believes enough aid has entered the enclave in recent weeks to last Gaza for several months. Jerusalem has	questioned the veracity of reports of famine in the enclave over the course of the war, which has been blamed on a lack of sufficient aid flowing into the Strip via Israel-controlled border crossings. Both Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said Israel was prepared to negotiate the next phase of the ceasefire but was insisting on more hostages being freed during the talks. “The commitment to bringing in this amount [of supplies to Gaza] was in the first phase,” Sa’ar said at a press conference. “The first phase ended, and we are implementing the principle of no free meals.” Israel announced it was adopting a previously unpublicized “Witkoff plan” early Sunday as the first stage of the ceasefire deal expired and the sides failed to negotiate a second phase. According to Israel’s account of Witkoff’s proposal, the halt in fighting would extend until the end of Passover on April 19. Under the plan, half of the remaining hostages — living and dead — would be released on the first day of the extended ceasefire, and the remaining captives would be released at the end of the period if a permanent ceasefire is reached. Netanyahu denied that Israel was shirking its commitment to negotiate the second phase, saying Witkoff proposed the extension after he understood there was no way to bridge Israeli and Hamas positions on moving to the next stage. “He even defined his proposal as a corridor for negotiations on phase two,” said Netanyahu. “Israel is ready for this.” Hamas rejected the new proposal and lashed out against Israel for cutting off aid, calling it “cheap extortion, a war crime and a blatant attack on the [hostage-ceasefire] agreement.” The terror group urged mediators to compel Israel to reverse the decision. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters the decision to halt goods would impact the ceasefire talks, adding his group “doesn’t respond to pressures.” Both sides stopped short of saying the ceasefire had ended, though Palestinians reported several killed in an Israeli strike in Beit Hanoun Sunday morning. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed the strike, saying a drone was used to hit suspects spotted planting explosives near troops stationed in the Strip. In a Jerusalem press conference on Sunday, Sa’ar insisted the halt of aid was fully coordinated with the White House. “The Americans, of course, accept our position, and are familiar with it,” the foreign minister said alongside his Croatian counterpart. He said Israel had received a side letter from the Biden administration “that explicitly states that there is no automatic transition between phases.” “We fulfilled all our commitments [under Phase 1] until the very last day, which was yesterday,” he told a press conference. “Our position is that during negotiations, hostages should be released.” Phase one of the ceasefire with Hamas formally ended at midnight as Saturday became Sunday. Minutes later, following a four-hour security consultation with top officials, Netanyahu’s office declared that it was endorsing what he described as a US proposal, which would see the ceasefire with Hamas extended through Ramadan and Passover, during which all hostages could potentially be released. The Israeli statement claimed that Hamas has so far rejected the US plan, and implied that if this stance isn’t changed, Israel could resume the war that was sparked by the Palestinian terror group’s October 7, 2023, devastating onslaught in southern Israel and that has been on pause since January 19. There has been no official comment from the US administration on Israel’s announcement nor has it confirmed the Witkoff proposal. Talks on the second phase were meant to begin on Day 16 of the 42-day first phase that has now ended, but Israel has not engaged in indirect talks with Hamas on the topic. Beyond failing to engage in talks on the second phase, Israel has also not begun pulling back from the Philadelphi Corridor, which it is required to begin doing this week according to the agreement with Hamas. Netanyahu has indicated he is opposed to redeploying troops away from the belt of land on the Gaza-Egypt border that Israel says is used as a key smuggling route by Hamas to rearm and rebuild its forces. Terror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the Israel Defense Forces. Two of the 24 abductees presumed alive, as well as three of the dead captives, don’t hold Israeli citizenship. During the first phase, 33 Israeli hostages were released, eight of them dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including many convicted terrorists serving hefty jail sentences. Five Thai nationals held hostage in the Gaza Strip were freed during the same period under a separate arrangement. Under the ceasefire outline agreed to by Israel and Hamas on January 19, the remaining living hostages were to be released during the second stage of the deal, during which the IDF would complete a full withdrawal from Gaza. A third stage is also planned, during which the bodies of hostages held by Gazan terror groups would be released, the war would end, and the reconstruction of Gaza would begin. Senior Israeli officials, including Defense Minister Israel Katz, have said in recent days that the military was preparing for the option of the war resuming. Witkoff is expected to visit Israel soon, likely this coming week. The Ynet news site reported early Sunday, without citing sources, that Jerusalem would likely hold off on renewing the fighting until the visit. A trip to the region planned for last week was called off due to a lack of progress in the talks. An Israeli official told The Times of Israel that Witkoff would not travel to the region until late in the week at the earliest, as he plans to remain in the United States for Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday.","Israel halts aid into Gaza, citing Hamas refusal to extend first phase of truce","Lazar Berman, ToI Staff, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-03-02T11:58:51,2025-03-02T11:58:51,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-02-2025-99402570996dcf33239d0492d99909e4,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced sharp criticism as it stopped the entry of all food and other supplies into Gaza on Sunday and warned of “additional consequences” for Hamas if a fragile ceasefire isn’t extended. Mediators Egypt and Qatar accused Israel of violating humanitarian law by using starvation as a weapon. The ceasefire’s first phase saw a surge in humanitarian aid after months ofgrowing hunger. Hamas accused Israel of trying to derailthe next phaseSunday hours after its first phase had ended and called Israel’s decision to cut off aid “a war crime and a blatant attack” on a truce that took a year of negotiations before taking hold in January. In the second phase, Hamas would release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire. Negotiations on the second phase were meant to start a month ago but haven’t begun. Israel said Sunday that a new U.S. proposal calls for extending the ceasefire through Ramadan —the Muslim holy monththat began over the weekend — andthe Jewish Passover holiday, which ends April 20. Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid. The militants currently hold 59 hostages, 35 of them believed to be dead. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the United States would support whatever decision Israel makes, without commenting on the new proposal. Netanyahu said Israel is fully coordinated with the Trump administration and the ceasefire will only continue as long as Hamas keeps releasing hostages. Saying the ceasefire has saved countless lives, the International Committee of the Red Cross said that “any unraveling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair.” U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher called Israel’s decision “alarming,” noting that international humanitarian law makes clear that aid access must be allowed. U.N. Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres urged all parties to make every effort to prevent a return to hostilities in Gaza, and called for humanitarian aid to flow back into Gaza immediately and for the release of all hostages, said spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric. Five non-governmental groups asked Israel’s Supreme Court for an interim order barring the state from preventing aid from entering Gaza, claiming the move violates Israel’s obligations under international law: “These obligations cannot be condition on political considerations.” The war has left most of Gaza’s population of over 2 million dependent on international aid. About 600 aid trucks had entered daily since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, easing fears of famine raised by international experts. But residents said prices shot up as word of the closure spread. Fromthe heavily destroyedJabaliya urban refugee camp, Fayza Nassar said the closure would worsen dire conditions. “There will be famine and chaos,” she said. Hamas warned that any attempt to delay or cancel the ceasefire agreement would have “humanitarian consequences” for the hostages. The only way to free them is through the existing deal, the group said. Families of hostages again pressed Israel’s government. “Postponing the negotiation on the deal for everyone’s (release) can’t happen,” Lishay Miran-Lavi, wife of hostage Omri Miran, said in Tel Aviv. “Hostages don’t have time to wait for an ideal deal.” Israel imposed a siege on Gaza in the war’s opening days and only eased it under U.S. pressure. U.N. agencies and aid groups accused Israel ofnot facilitating enough aidduring 15 months of war. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used “starvation as a method of warfare” when it issuedan arrest warrant for Netanyahulast year. The allegation is also central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justiceaccusing Israel of genocide. Israel has denied the accusations. It says it has allowed in enough aid and blamed shortages on what it called the U.N.’s inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid — an allegation that Netanyahu repeated Sunday. Kenneth Roth, former head of Human Rights Watch, said Israel as an occupying power has an “absolute duty” to facilitate humanitarian aid under the Geneva Conventions, and called Israel’s decision “a resumption of the war-crime starvation strategy” that led to the ICC warrant. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. Israel’s offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It says more than half of those killed were women and children. It does not specify how many of the dead were combatants. Israeli bombardment pounded large areas of Gaza to rubble and displaced some 90% of the population. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 35 of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead, not 32. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-guyana-oil-exxonmobil-1142faf844adffab680b3b643bd27799,"GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali on Saturday denounced an incursion by an armed Venezuelan naval vessel in disputed waters that are home to a mammoth offshore oil deposit being developed by ExxonMobil. In a televised address, Ali said Guyana was hurriedly notifying all of its international allies, including the Trump administration, and had summoned Venezuela’s ambassador in the capital, Georgetown, to lodge a formal protest. “This incursion is a matter of grave concern,” he said. “Guyana’s maritime boundaries are recognized under international law. This is a serious development concerning our nation’s maritime territory. We will not tolerate threats to territorial integrity.” Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez disputed Ali’s claims and called ExxonMobil’s oil installations “illegal.” “He’s telling bald-faced lies,” she said in a statement, referring to Guyana’s president.  The Trump administration, which this week took swift action to tighten sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro ‘s government, echoed Ali’s concerns.  “Further provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime,” the U.S. State Department said on X.   Feud over land and maritime borders Ali said the Venezuelan vessel passed close to several huge vessels used to store oil being produced by three oilfields operated by Exxon and partners Hess Corp and CNOOC of China in the Stabroek Block containing an estimated 11 billion barrels of oil. He said several aircraft and marine vessels had been deployed to support the large number of drill ships, seismic vessels and support ships operating in the bloc. Saturday’s development came two weeks after armed men, suspected Venezuelan pirates operating in the border Cuyuni River, exchanged gunfire with a Guyanese military patrol, injuring six soldiers, two of them seriously.  Since ExxonMobil made its major oil discovery in Guyana in 2015, Venezuela has revived a century-old territorial dispute with Guyana and taken steps to annex the remote Essequibo region that comprises about two thirds of Guyana’s land mass. The two neighboring states have feuded over land and maritime borders for decades as Venezuela claims that an 1890s boundaries commission cheated it out of the oil rich region. The area was administered by Britain for more than a century, and it has been under Guyanese control since 1966, when the nation gained its independence from the United Kingdom.",Guyana's denounces Venezuelan naval incursion in oil field operated by ExxonMobil,,AP News,2025-03-01T12:52:59,2025-03-01T17:01:13,gemini-2.0-flash

Ramadan, which began Friday night, runs until March 29. Passover ends on April 19. Half of the hostages â		  living and dead â		  would be released on the first day of the extended ceasefire, says the Prime Ministerâ																																																																																																																																																																 s Office in a statement released after a four-hour meeting headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The remaining hostages would be released at the end of the period if a permanent ceasefire is reached, says the PMO, stressing that this is a plan proposed by US special envoy Steve Witkoff.

The PMO claims that Hamas has repeatedly violated the agreement, while Israel is in full compliance. However, the agreement states that talks on phase two of the deal will begin â		  no later than day 16.â		  Israel has not engaged in indirect talks with Hamas on the second phase of the agreement until after day 42. Additionally, the IDF didnâ																																																																																																																																																																 t start withdrawing its forces from the Philadelphi Corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border on Saturday, despite the deal requiring Israel to start this process on day 42.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-releases-video-of-hostage-pleading-to-be-freed-as-his-brother-is-separated-from-him/,"ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 573 Hamas published a propaganda video Saturday showing Iair Horn, 46, who was released from captivity two weeks ago, saying goodbye to his younger brother Eitan, 38, who is still being held in the Gaza Strip. After approving the publication of the video, the family of the captive demanded the government continue the hostage-ceasefire deal, the first phase of which is scheduled to end at midnight Saturday. Hamas hasrejectedan Israeli proposal to extend the first phase, insisting that the deal proceed to stage two, which Israel has largely refused to negotiate for the past month. The video begins with five hostages sitting on the floor â		 Sagui Dekel-Chen, and two more hostages whose faces Hamas blurred in the video â		 sitting in a room, preparing to eat. The father of hostage Nimrod Cohen later identified his son as one of the other hostages by the tattoo on his forearm. â		He got the tattoo a few days before he was kidnapped,â		 Yehuda Cohen told the Ynet news site. â		Iâ			Iâ			ms games.â		 The hostages embrace each other in the video ahead of the release of Iair and Dekel-Chen, which Eitan says in the video would be taking place the next day. Iair Horn, Dekel-Chen, and Sasha Troufanov werereleasedon February 15 as part of the first phase of the deal. The camera then pans to the face of a distraught Eitan, seemingly overwhelmed about being left behind. â		I am very happy that my brother will be released tomorrow, but it is not logical in any way that families are being separated,â		 Eitan says, his voice cracking. â		Get everyone out and stop [separating] families, and do not destroy our lives anymore,â		 he adds, before crying into the shoulder of his older brother Iair. â		Tell mom, dad and everyone to continue with the demonstrations [for a hostages deal], that they shouldnâ			should sign already onto the second and third phases of the deal to return all of us home,â		 Eitan tells his brother Iair. â		Do everything you can.â		 â		You are now forcing me to leave my little brother here to die,â		 Iair says into the camera, with his arm still around Eitanâ			 shoulder. Eitan expresses his disbelief and disgust that Israelâ			 government is not interested in moving forward with the dealâ			 second phase. â		Have you gone crazy?â		 he asks. â		My brother is leaving, and Iâ			 Eitan says that sometimes he receives food and sometimes he doesnâ			 sometimes heâ			 okay and sometimes heâ			 But here, Iâ			 okay,â		 he says, pointing to his head, apparently referring to the psychological effects of captivity. Eitan then addresses Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly and pleads with him to sign onto the second phase of the hostage deal. In their statement, the Horn family said, â		Our hearts break seeing Eitan in this difficult situation being separated from his brother to continue being held in Hamasâ			 hell for [what now is] 512 days.â		 â		You can see in Eitanâ			 eyes the despair and fear he is in. Since Iair returned to us, he has not stopped thinking and acting for Eitan and all hostages he met in captivity who remain in Gaza. â		We demand that the decision-makers look Eitan in the eye and continue the deal that has already returned dozens of hostages. They are running out of time! Bring everyone home â		 now â		 and in one fell swoop,â		 the family added. In a statement, the Prime Ministerâ			 Office called the video â		brutal propaganda.â		 â		The Hamas terrorist organization released another brutal propaganda video this evening, in which our hostages are forced to engage in psychological warfare,â		 the PMO said. Promising not to be deterred, Netanyahuâ			 office pledged to â		work tirelessly to return all of our hostages and meet all of Israelâ			 war goals.â		 Nimrod Cohenâ			 father Yehuda rejected Netanyahuâ			 branding of the video as â		psychological terrorâ		 and accused the premier of sacrificing the hostages in order to maintain his grip on power. Iair Horn was abducted from his home in Nir Oz on October 7 as Hamas terrorists swarmed through the kibbutz, killing or kidnapping a quarter of the southern communityâ			 residents. Israel says 251 people were kidnapped and some 1,200 killed during the massive Hamas-led onslaught across southern Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. His brother, Eitan, who was visiting from Kfar Saba for the holiday weekend, was also kidnapped and is still held in Gaza. He was not on the list of â		 cases â		 women, children, elderly individuals, and the infirm â		 slated for release in the first stage of the ceasefire. The first, 42-day phase of the agreement formally expires Saturday. Thirty-three Israeli hostages have been released â		 eight of them dead, along with five Thai nations. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners have been freed. Under the ceasefire outline, the remaining living hostages â		 believed to number 24 â		 are to be released during the second stage of the deal, during which the Israel Defense Forces would complete a full withdrawal from Gaza. A third stage is also planned, during which the bodies of hostages killed on October 7 or in captivity would be released, and the war would end permanently.

https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-london-bf158d8f9e10a7c049ea90f8fd917ab6,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the American people and leadership and voiced hope for “strong relations,” a day after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with U.S. President Donald Trump that left many uncertain where the once staunch allies stood. Zelenskyy on Saturday arrived in London ahead of a summit on Sunday organized by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer with other European leaders. The summit will also include leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Finland, Sweden, Czechia and Romania, as well as the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council. The meltdown that unfolded Friday in the final minutes of the highly anticipated meeting at the White House between Trump and Zelenskyy seemed to dash, at least for now, Ukrainian hopes that the United States could be locked in as a reliable partner in helping fend off, and conclude, Russia’s three-year onslaught. Here’s the latest: NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he had to “find a way to restore his relationship with the American president” after the two leaders engaged in an extraordinary meltdown at the White House on Friday. Rutte told the BBC on Saturday that he told Zelenskyy that “he really had to respect what President Trump has done so far for Ukraine.” He was referring to the first Trump administration’s decision in 2019 to supply Ukraine with Javelin antitank missiles that Ukraine used to deadly effect against Russian tanks in the first wave of the 2022 invasion. Calling the Friday meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy “unfortunate,” Rutte said he “knew as a fact that the American administration is extremely invested in making sure that Ukraine gets to a durable peace” with Russia. Rutte said he expected European leaders, who were meeting in London on Sunday, to help secure a future peace deal by providing Ukraine with security guarantees. Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski says she is “sick to her stomach” that the Trump administration “appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin.” Murkowski, a longtime senator from Alaska with an independent steak, has been one of the few Republicans in Congress willing to publicly break with Trump. Her statement Saturday was a lonely voice of support among Republicans in Washington. Even Republicans sympathetic to Ukraine, including Sen. Lindsey Graham and House Speaker Mike Johnson, have been critical of Zelenskyy following Friday’s contentious White House meeting. “This week started with administration officials refusing to acknowledge that Russia started the war in Ukraine,” Murkowski wrote on X. “It ends with a tense, regrettable conversation in the Oval Office and whispers from the White House that they may try to end all U.S. support for Ukraine.” French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with President Donald Trump and his Ukraine counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy after their stunning spat in the Oval Office on live television, the French presidency said. Macron had calls with Trump and Zelenskyy ahead of Sunday’s summit in London to discuss Ukraine. He also spoke with British Prime minister Keir Starmer, EU Council president Antonio Costa and NATO secretary general Mark Rutte, the Elysee Palace said. The phone calls were also aimed at preparing a summit of EU leaders next week in Brussels that will also focus on the future of Ukraine. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer embraced President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday and told him he had the nation’s unwavering support a day after the blowout at the White House with President Donald Trump. The Ukraine leader arrived in London to shouts of support from people who had gathered outside Starmer’s official residence where he was hugged by the British prime minister. “And as you heard from the cheers on the street outside, you have full backing across the United Kingdom,” Starmer told him. “We stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take.” Zelenskyy, who thanked Starmer and the people of the U.K. for their support and friendship, will meet with King Charles III on Sunday before attending the summit with European leaders. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says the European Union should follow “the example of the United States” and start “direct discussions with Russia on a ceasefire and sustainable peace in Ukraine.” Orban, considered the Kremlin’s closest partner among EU leaders, said in a letter to the president of the European Council that “this approach is not reconcilable” with the draft conclusions for an upcoming summit of EU leaders next week in Brussels. The draft conclusions state that there can be no negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine, and that a ceasefire can only take place as part of a comprehensive peace agreement. The letter from Orban was leaked Saturday and its authenticity was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person with knowledge of the document. The person requested to remain anonymous because the letter was not public. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala says “Europe faces a historic test” and has to be able to take care of itself. “Nobody else will do it.” Vice President JD Vance, right, speaks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, as President Donald Trump listens in the Oval Office at the White House, Friday, Feb. 28, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/ Mystyslav Chernov) Fila said Saturday that Europe has to increase its military support for Ukraine and European countries have to increase their arms spending to reach “at least” 3% of GDP. “If we don’t increase our effort fast enough and let the aggressor dictate its conditions, we won’t end up well,” he said. Slovak populist Prime Minister Robert Fico repeated his country won’t provide Ukraine any military or financial support that would help it fight Russia. Fico also demanded that an emergency EU summit in Brussels on Thursday agree to a call for an immediate ceasefire, “which is something that President Zelenskyy and a majority of EU member states refuse to do.” Fico said his country also wants the summit to specifically request Ukraine to reopen the transit of Russian gas to Europe. He warned that if the summit doesn’t respect the Slovak requests, “the European Council might not be able to agree on its position regarding Ukraine on Thursday.” President Donald Trump’s national security adviser says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “has not gotten the memo that this is a new sheriff in town.” Mike Waltz said Saturday on Fox News that the Ukrainian leader heard from former President Joe Biden, “as long as it takes, as much as it takes, blank check.” Waltz spoke a day after a White House blowout between Trump and Zelenskyy derailed plans to sign an economic agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine. He rejected suggestions among some Trump critics that the president and Vice President JD Vance “ambushed” Zelenskyy. “That is absolutely and categorically false,” Waltz said. Russian forces have captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed Saturday, as they continue a monthslong grinding offensive in what was once the country’s industrial heartland. If confirmed, the capture of Burlatske and Skudne would mark a further push northwest by Russia in the eastern Donetsk region. Ukraine did not immediately comment.

(AP Photo Klochko) An open-source Ukrainian map widely used by the military and analysts showed the pace of Russian advances appeared to be slowing for a third consecutive month. The team behind the map, Deepstate, attributed this slowdown to heavy casualties. But Russian troops continued to inch forward, in what appears to be a long-term bid by the Kremlin to wear down Ukraine’s defenses. Poland’s President Andrzej Duda has called on Zelenskyy to return to the negotiating table in order to ensure the security of his country, arguing that only the United States is able to stop Russian aggression. Duda is a strong supporter of Ukraine and has friendly ties with Trump. “Volodymyr Zelenskyy should return to this table, sit calmly at this table, remain calm, negotiate a solution that will make Ukraine safe,” Duda told reporters in Poland. He said that he sees no other force than the United States that could stop Russian aggression. Russia said on Saturday that it shot down three Ukrainian drones that targeted part of the infrastructure of the TurkStream gas pipeline, which transports Russian gas across the Black Sea to Turkey and Europe. The Russian defense ministry said the drones aimed to strike a compressor station in Russia’s southern Krasnodar region, in the latest of a series of similar attacks this year. Its claims could not be independently confirmed, and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Before its troops moved into Ukraine, Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union’s pipeline natural gas. Most of these flows have since halted, with exports from Norway and the U.S. filling the gap. The TurkStream pipeline continues to send gas to EU member Hungary, as well as Turkey and Serbia. The French minister of the armed forces says France’s nuclear deterrent will remain the prerogative of the country’s president as European leaders mull ways to bolster their security amid uncertainty over U.S. support. Sebastien Lecornu posted a clarification on the social network X on Saturday after French president Emmanuel Macron said he was ready to open discussions on a possible European nuclear deterrent. “Our nuclear deterrent is French, and it will remain so: from the design and production of our weapons, to their deployment on the decision of the President of the Republic,” Lecornu said. “It protects France’s vital interests, which the head of state alone is responsible for defining.” Future German leader Friedrich Merz has suggested that Britain and France could “share” their nuclear weapons in the future. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said “a new era of ruthlessness” had begun in the wake of Trump’s treatment of Zelenskyy at the White House, but vowed that it would only increase her country’s commitment to Ukraine. “Many of you will have slept fitfully tonight in the face of the unspeakable videos from the White House. Frankly, so did I. Unfortunately, this was not a bad dream, but a violent reality,” she told reporters on Saturday. “Our horror is greater today than before, but so is our commitment to the people of Ukraine, to our own security and to peace in Europe.” She described Ukraine as “part of free and democratic Europe” and said there is no question as to who is the aggressor and who is “the brave defender” in the war. A nighttime Russian drone strike on Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv wounded 12 civilians, including two children, the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine reported on Saturday. According to Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov, some of the drones hit a medical facility where inpatients were staying overnight, while others damaged residential buildings.

(AP Photo Marienko) Ukraine’s air force said Russia overnight launched a total of 154 attack drones at Ukrainian territory, 103 of which were shot down. Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson described Friday’s Oval Office blowout between Trump and Zelenskyy as a “complete political and diplomatic failure” for Kyiv. In a statement Saturday, Maria Zakharova also slammed the “political weakness and extreme moral degradation” of European leaders who continue to support Ukraine and its president. Zakharova said Russia’s war aims remain unchanged, implying Moscow will insist on a demilitarized Ukraine barred from NATO, and on annexing Ukrainian territories it controls. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier criticized Trump in unusually sharp terms for his behavior during the meeting with Zelenskyy at the Oval Office. “Diplomacy fails when negotiating partners are humiliated in front of the whole world,” Steinmeier told dpa, the German news agency, during a flight to Uruguay. “The scene in the White House yesterday took my breath away. I would never have believed that we would one day have to protect Ukraine from the USA.” French President Emmanuel Macron said if someone is gambling with World War III, it is not Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyybut more likely his Russian counterpart. Macron reacted to Friday’s heated exchange between U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpand Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, during which Trump accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with World War III.” “If anyone is gambling with World War III, his name is Vladimir Putin,” Macron told Portugal’s RTP news channel during a visit to Lisbon ahead of Sunday’s Ukraine summit of European leaders in London. Macron said he still hopes that the United States will remain committed to the defense of democracy. “My hope is that the United States of America will continue to stand by its history and its principles,” he said. “Whenever we have had major conflicts, the United States of America has been on the right side of history and freedom.” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Saturday spoke to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov about the war in Ukraine, officials said. The phone call came a day before Fidan is due to attend a London summit of European leaders to discuss bringing the three-year conflict to an end. Turkey, which has close ties to both Ukraine and Russia, has previously offered to mediate talks. It hosted unsuccessful peace talks in 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy voiced thanks to the “American people” and leadership, and hope for “strong relations,” less than a day after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with Trump that left many uncertain where the once staunch allies stood. Ukraine had walked into the meeting prepared to sign a mineral deal with the U.S., hoping it would be a step toward a just ceasefire, but left empty handed. Soon after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy left the White House on Friday after an astonishing Oval Office row with US President Donald Trump, Ukrainians rallied around Zelenskyy as a defender of his country’s interests. (AP video by Alex Babenko and produced by Dmytro Zhyhinas) In a series of posts on X on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukrainians are “very grateful to the United States for all the support,” and specifically thanked Trump and Congress alongside the “American people.” “Our relationship with the American President is more than just two leaders: It’s a historic and solid bond between our peoples. … American people helped save our people,” he said. “We want only strong relations with America and I really hope we will have them,” he added. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to meet Saturday afternoon with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the dramatic blowout withPresident Donald Trumpat the White House. Zelenskyy’s plane with the Ukrainian flag on its tail landed at London Stansted Airport the morning after the diplomatic spat on live TV. Zelenskyy had been due to meet with Starmer on Sunday, hours before taking part in a London summit of European leaders to discuss how to ensure a peaceful end to the war and provide security across the continent. But the timetable for their bilateral meeting was apparently sped up in the aftermath of the Washington visit.",The Latest: Most European leaders back Zelenskyy as he joins crisis talks in London,The Associated Press,AP News,2025-03-01T12:23:36,2025-03-01T17:57:09,gemini-2.0-flash

Starmer started off his Sunday by telling the BBC that the UK and France will work with Ukraine ""on a plan to stop the fighting"" with Russia - and will then ""discuss that plan with the United States"". After a swift stop at No10 tomeet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, he headed to Lancaster House to greet the 18 leaders â	“ mostly from Europe, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky â	“ for his Ukraine summit. A little over two hours later, Starmer was back in Downing Street warning that â	“we are at a crossroads in history todayâ	”. He said the UK would be allowing Ukraine access to Â£1.6bn of export finance to buy an additional 5,000 air defence missiles â	“ and the leaders had reached an understanding on four crucial steps needed to secure peace in Ukraine. As Starmer spoke, Zelensky flew to Sandringhamfor a meeting with King Charlesbefore a 90-minute chat with reporters ahead of his trip back to Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said he still wants ""the Ukrainian position to be heard"" while adding his country is stillprepared to go ahead with a rare minerals deal with the USdespite his heated confrontation with Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday. ""If we agreed to sign the minerals deal, weâ	’re ready to sign it,"" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. He also suggested that he's aware of a reported joint proposal by Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macronfor a one-month truce with Russia. ""I'm aware of everything,""he said in reply. We'll be pausing our coverage of the latest efforts to secure a diplomatic conclusion to the war in Ukraine. Thank you so much for sticking with us today - have a great evening. And here's our mini-photo gallery reflecting the highlights of what has proved to be a very busy news day in London. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer (front row, centre) hosted a crisis summit with key international leaders at London's Lancaster House to discuss urgent measures to help achieve a just peace in Ukraine, following a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (front row, second right) and his US counterpart Donald Trump Zelensky (second right) got a warm reception at the gathering - in what is seen as a public show of support for the leader of a war-torn country still struggling to repel a full-scale invasion Russia launched more than three years ago After the summit, Keir Starmer unveiled a four-step plan to guarantee peace in Ukraine, including the continuation of military aid to Kyiv and more economic pressure on Russia Later in the day, President Zelensky (right) met King Charles at his residence in Sandringham, Norfolk To cap the very busy day, Zelensky held a media briefing, telling the BBC that Ukraine remained ready to sign a major minerals deal with the US During his sit-down with the press earlier this evening, Zelensky was asked about accepting the current line of contact as Ukraine's de-facto new border. ""Today we are talking about the first steps,"" Zelensky says about today's meeting with fellow leaders, saying he doesn't want to talk about them until they are down on paper. He goes on to say that they are not talking about concessions of any kind before saying everyone needs to recognise that Ukraine will never recognise territories currently occupied by Russia as Russian land. Zelensky ends his answer by adding that Ukraine hopes that security guarantees will make it â	“100% impossibleâ	” for Russia to pursue further aggression - but saying he doesnâ	’t want to talk about the details until there are signatures on paper from Ukraineâ	’s partners. More now from French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmerand their reported proposed one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine. In an interview with France's Le Figaro newspaper, Macron says such a truce would not - initially, at least - cover ground fighting but would be ""in the air, at sea"". But he admits it would be very difficult to verify that the ceasefire was actually being respected on such a vast front line. Peacekeepers could be deployed at a later date, the French leader also suggests before adding: ""There won't be European troops on Ukrainian soil in the coming weeks."" He also suggests European countries should raise their defence spending to between 3 and 3.5 % of GDP to respond to Washington's shifting priorities and Russia's militarisation. We can bring you some more comments from Volodymyr Zelensky from his final media appearance before heading back to Ukraine. Asked for his thoughts on todayâ	’s summit and his security guarantees goals, he says Ukraine believes its best security guarantee â	“is a strong Ukrainian armyâ	” - something he says he's sure Sir Keir Starmer knows too. He says it's ""important"" European allies are not reconsidering Russia's role as the aggressor party, adding he's raised the issue of using frozen Russian assets to help with the reconstruction of his country again. Ukraineâ	’s relationship with the US will continue, Zelensky says, later adding that he doesn't think that Friday's scenes inside the Oval Office ""brought something positive or additional to us as partners"". He adds that he's ""sure that this situation will pass by"" and that in the future, if talks are ""constructive, a positive result will come"". James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent In recent weeks, diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in Ukraine have been led by Donald Trump, speaking to President Putin and, well, at President Zelensky. All the while, his administration has gone after its European allies; questioning their democracy, voting against them at the United Nations and today â	“ in the form of the presidentâ	’s chief enforcer, Elon Musk â	“ saying even the US should leave the Nato military alliance. This has left the transatlantic alliance on the brink. So todayâ	’s summit was an attempt by the prime minister both to calm diplomatic brows and stiffen diplomatic sinews. His plan, along with the French, is to explorea new way of finding a ceasefire in Ukraineand in so doing take some ownership of the process. Diplomats said there was clear resolve to support Ukraine but also to build on Trumpâ	’s desire to find a ceasefire. That included more countries offering Ukraine greater security guarantees to deter Russian aggression, turning the country into what the European Commission chiefUrsula von der Leyen described a steel porcupine. But Europe stepping up is only half of the story. The prime minister made clear the US has to be willing to play its part. And today there were mixed messages. The secretary of state Marco Rubio said America was ready to engage with Ukraine. But the US national security adviser Mike Waltz suggested Zelensky might have to resign as part of any ceasefire. We've reported a little earlier that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned a deal on minerals between the US and Ukrainecould not be signed ""without a peace deal"" with Russia. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg has quizzed Zelensky about the future of the agreement - noting the White House is now â	“making clear you need to budge somehowâ	”. Zelensky answers saying the minerals deal is ready for minister to sign. â	“It is our policy to continue what happened in the past, weâ	’re constructive,â	” he continues, â	“if we agreed to sign the minerals deal, weâ	’re ready to sign it.â	” â	“The agreement thatâ	’s on the table will be signed if the parties are ready,â	” he concludes. Kuenssberg also asks the Ukrainian president about comments from French President Emmanuel Macron about a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine. French national newspaper Le Figaro reports Macron said he and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have proposed the temporary cessation of the conflict ""in the air, at sea"". Asked whether he's aware of the plan, Zelensky says: ""I'm aware of everything."" This video can not be played Are you aware of truce reports, Zelensky? - asks Kuenssberg We can now bring you fresh remarks from Volodymyr Zelensky, who's sat down with members of the media before heading back to Ukraine. Are you willing in principle, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks, to talk about conceding territory as well as in principle expressing some regret to President Trump after your heated confrontation at the White House on Friday? While he doesn't directly address the question, he says: â	“I just want the Ukrainian position to be heard,â	” adding that he didnâ	’t want his countryâ	’s position to be ambiguous. But he says â	“we must all understand and know each other, and we must understand the red lines,â	” saying those red lines are not emotional, but they just happen to be there. We can now bring you Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's reaction to his meeting with fellow leaders in London earlier today. ""We feel strong support for Ukraine, our people: soldiers and civilians, our independence,"" he writes on Telegram. ""We are working together in Europe to create a solid foundation for cooperation with America for the sake of real peace and guaranteed security."" ""European unity is at an exceptionally high level, which has not been seen for a long time,"" he adds. A little earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was asked if aminerals deal between Ukraine and the USis still on the table. He tells the BBC's US partner CBS it's ""impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal"". Bessent says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ""thrown off the sequencing"" of how the minerals deal and peace deal were supposed to play out, and that it's unclear if he now wants to proceed. ""President Trump's idea for this economic arrangement was to further intertwine American and Ukrainian people and to show the Russian leadership that there was no daylight,"" says Bessent. He adds that Zelensky came to the Oval Office and ""tried to relitigate in front of the world"". ""The place to have done that would have been in the private lunch,"" he says. John CampbellBBC News NI economics and business editor During his speech, the prime minister said5,000 air defence missiles will be supplied to Ukraine. They will be manufactured in Belfast at a factory operated by Thales, a French arms manufacturer. The lightweight multirole missiles (LMMs) are intended to protect against Russian drone and missile attacks. Ukrainian forces are already using LMMs with an initial order delivered late last year. The order is much bigger, worth up to Â£1.6bn and will involve Thales hiring an additional 200 people in Belfast. More reaction from other European leaders now, firstly fromPoland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk. He has posted on X to say ""Europe has woken up"", alongside a photograph of the leaders at the summit earlier today. Tusk says those present ""all speak with one voice about helping Ukraine, the need for close transatlantic cooperation and strengthening the eastern border"". Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has given her reaction too, and says ""the one thing we absolutely cannot afford is a peace [in Ukraine] that does not last"". She continues: ""We must be very careful when assessing what is being proposed, particularly in response to this key question: could this peace be violated? Because, unfortunately, we have seen this happen in the past."" And there have been words on X too from outgoingGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who mentions that being ""transatlantic allies"" in Nato remains ""the key for security"" in the US, Canada and Europe. He says the alliance has been strengthened in recent years ""with new members and defence spending"" and that is ""the path we will continue to follow in the future as well"". Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, also on X, reiterates that Europe ""must take a greater role in ensuring safety for our continent"" and adds that ""good transatlantic relations are also indispensable"". Over the past 48 hours, we've seen several pro-Ukraine marches take place in Europe and the US - including today in London as leaders met to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Here are some pictures from the latest demonstrations: Demonstrators set up outside Downing Street as Starmer hosted close European allies and Volodymyr Zelensky at Lancaster House There was a demonstration on Avenue des Arts in front of the US embassy in Brussels A woman marches in support of Ukraine in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin yesterday A crowd of pro-Ukraine demonstrators also assembled in Turin, northern Italy, earlier today And people gather on the Boston Common in support of Ukraine and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Boston, Massachusetts Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring's Russia editor Zelensky not wearing a suit to a meeting with the King was always going to attract commentary, but the symbolism of his trademark informal shirt shot up following the spat in the Oval Office on Friday. Donald Trump â	“who had referred to himself as king,externalon social media days earlier - appeared to have an issue with it, and one conservative US reporter present at the tempestuous meeting accused the Ukrainian president of â	“not respecting the dignity of this officeâ	”. Looks like King Charles has no such problems with Zelenskyâ	’s attire. Before we heard from Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Nato chief Mark Rutte was speaking to reporters outside Lancaster House as he left this afternoon's summit and described the talks as ""really positive"". He said that ""more European countries will ramp up defence spendingâ	” but did not go into specifics. Rutte described increased defence spending as ""very good news"" and reiterated the need for ""more of a fair balance"" with the US. He also told reporters that the first step was to make sure there is a peace deal before there are discussions about how to guarantee it. We're seeing some more pictures now from the meeting at Sandringham Estate between King Charles and Zelensky. The pair's meeting was announced yesterday and Zelensky made his way to meet with the King after the summit of European leaders at Lancaster House, in central London. We've just heard from UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer following the summit in London where leaders from Europe, Canada and Turkey met to discuss working together for the security of Ukraine and the continent as a whole. Starmer said ""we are at a crossroads in history,"" and unveiled the following plans: We'll keep brining you analysis and reaction to the European leaders summit throughout the evening. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk for his meeting with King Charles. Local people, some holding Ukraine flags, gathered outside the estate to try to witness his arrival. Finally, Starmer is asked whether he fears that the West might split over its support for Ukraine - a reference to relations between Europe and the US. The question came after comments made earlier by Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, who said the West must ""avoid the risk"" of dividing. Starmer says that he and Meloni share ""a huge amount of common ground"" on feeling that Europe and the US have to stand together. He adds that it is important for the security of Europe that the continent works closely aligned with the US. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202503/01/content_WS67c3046cc6d0868f4e8f02fc.html,"BEIJING, March 1 -- China's national ""two sessions,"" a key political event shaping the country's policy direction, are set to convene in Beijing next week against the backdrop of a complex and challenging domestic and global environment. The annual session of the top political advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, will commence on Tuesday. The session of the top legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), will open on Wednesday. The Chinese premier, top legislator, top political advisor, chief justice, and top procurator will present work reports. Lawmakers will review the government's annual budget and development plan. They will deliberate an amendment to the law on deputies to the NPC and local people's congresses. On the sidelines of the event, ministers from various government departments will engage with the public through interviews and press conferences, clarifying policies and responding to pressing concerns. The ""two sessions"" serve as a critical window to observe China's development plan for the coming year. Decisions and policy announcements made here will not only affect the lives of 1.4 billion Chinese but also have an impact outside the country's borders. So, what can be expected from this year's ""two sessions""? GROWTH TARGET FOR 2025 Typically, the GDP growth target set in the government work report is one of the most closely watched figures. As China's economy shifts toward high-quality development, GDP is not the sole measure of the economy. But it remains an important indicator. In 2024, China achieved its growth target of around 5 percent, thanks in large part to a series of significant macroeconomic measures introduced to offset economic downturn pressure. GDP growth serves as a cornerstone metric with profound and wide-ranging significance. Despite the challenges China's economy has faced in recent years, it is projected to contribute about 30 percent of global economic growth in 2024, making it the largest source of growth for the world economy. INCREMENTAL POLICIES To achieve its growth target, China will roll out more targeted policies to stimulate economic activity. The government work report is expected to announce policy measures to ensure the goal is met. China has already signaled a shift in its macroeconomic stance. At the Central Economic Work Conference last December, policymakers pledged to roll out more proactive macro policies in 2025. Notably, they decided to adopt a ""moderately loose"" monetary policy, marking a significant departure from the ""prudent"" approach over the past 14 years. The meeting outlined nine key priorities, with boosting consumption at the forefront. This reflects China's emphasis on domestic demand as a top economic priority. In 2025, large-scale equipment upgrades and consumer goods trade-in programs are expected to be promoted with greater intensity and in a broader scope. According to Finance Minister Lan Fo'an, China in 2025 will actively use the room for a higher deficit, increase the issuance of local government special-purpose bonds, continue to issue ultra-long special treasury bonds, and increase transfer payments from the central government to local governments. The specifics of these plans will also be a key focus of this year's ""two sessions."" INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LEADERS, LEGISLATORS, ADVISORS During the ""two sessions,"" Chinese leaders, who are NPC deputies themselves, will interact with their fellow lawmakers at group deliberations. They will also interact with political advisors to discuss hotspot topics that matter most to state governance. These interactions serve as a window for observing how the central leadership stays informed about grassroots realities. This is a defining feature of Chinese democracy, often described in contemporary discourse as whole-process people's democracy. In recent years, President Xi Jinping, a deputy of Jiangsu Province's delegation to the 14th NPC, has typically participated in the delegation's deliberations. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, also attended the meetings of the NPC delegation of the armed forces and joined group discussions of political advisors from various sectors. During these interactions, Xi emphasized key priorities such as supporting the growth of the private sector and private enterprises, accelerating digital economy development, and advancing high-level opening-up -- all crucial to China's economic and social progress. FOREIGN POLICY The ""two sessions"" also shed light on China's foreign policy, as the foreign minister typically holds a press conference on the sidelines of the meetings. Last year, Foreign Minister Wang Yi answered 21 questions during a 90-minute press conference, with journalists from across the world participating. The foreign minister touched on various regional and international hotspot issues, such as the Ukraine crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He also expounded on China's foreign policies toward Russia, the United States, Europe, and Global South countries. During this year's ""two sessions,"" China's propositions on international relations are particularly noteworthy against the backdrop of a rapidly changing and turbulent global landscape. AI, INNOVATION Without a doubt, technological innovation will be a key focus during this year's ""two sessions,"" with the artificial intelligence (AI) industry very likely to take center stage. Over the past month, Chinese tech start-up DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the global AI industry and capital markets by introducing an open-source and popular chatbot. Domestically, companies such as Tencent, Baidu, and BYD have begun integrating DeepSeek into their products. Some local governments have also announced collaborations with the DeepSeek AI model to enhance public services, while others have organized training sessions to help officials and business professionals better understand the development and applications of DeepSeek and other AI technologies. In fact, AI has already emerged as one of the hottest topics at many of this year's provincial-level ""two sessions."" Many AI-related plans mentioned in provincial government work reports focus on building innovation platforms, promoting deeper industry integration, and improving policy frameworks. It's important to note that the rise of innovations like DeepSeek reflects China's commitment to taking the lead in technological advancements and its broader strategic focus on talent cultivation, innovation-friendly environment, business environment improvements, and the nurturing of non-public investments. These elements are expected to be underscored during the ""two sessions."" Additionally, the sessions provide a crucial platform for lawmakers and political advisors to offer suggestions and foster broad consensus on national development. Some of them are corporate executives and leading researchers. What AI-related proposals and suggestions they will present will be a major point of interest for China watchers.",Things to watch at China's 2025 'two sessions',Xinhua,www.gov.cn,2025-03-01T20:58,2025-03-01T20:58,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250301000652320?section=economy-finance/economy,"SEOUL, March 1 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's exports increased 1 percent last month from a year earlier, rebounding from a decrease the previous month, thanks to an increase in overseas sales of computers and automobiles, data showed Saturday. Outbound shipments came to US$52.6 billion last month, compared with $52.1 billion a year ago, according to data compiled by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. Imports rose 0.2 percent on-year to $48.3 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $4.3 billion. Exports returned to growth just a month after they decreased in January due to a fewer number of business days. This Feb. 19, 2025, file photo shows cars waiting to be exported near a port in Pyeongtaek, about 65 kilometers south of Seoul. (Yonhap) The ministry said the rise in exports came on the back of the robust performance of automobiles and computers, which includes solid-state drives (SSDs). Automobile exports jumped 17.8 percent on-year to $6.1 billion last month, snapping their three-month losing streak. In particular, overseas sales of hybrid cars soared 74.3 percent to $1.3 billion. Exports of computers, including SSDs, advanced 28.5 percent to $800 million to extend their on-year gains to the 14th consecutive month, and exports of wireless communication equipment surged 42.3 percent to $1.5 billion. Bio-health exports climbed 16.1 percent to $1.4 billion, with biopharmaceutical sales, in particular, shooting up 45.5 percent. Outbound shipments of chips, however, dropped 3 percent on-year to $9.6 billion last month, due to a steep fall in the price of memory chips. Exports of petroleum products decreased 12.2 percent to $3.9 billion due to a decline in gasoline and diesel prices. Exports of ships and rechargeable batteries also dipped 10.8 percent and 9.6 percent to $1.6 billion and $630 million, respectively. This file photo taken Feb. 12, 2025, shows a port in Busan, about 325 kilometers southeast of Seoul. (Yonhap) By destination, exports to China slipped 1.4 percent to $9.5 billion last month due to sluggish chip sales, while exports to the United States rose 1 percent to $9.9 billion, thanks to strong demand for chips and computers. Outbound shipments to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) gained 12.6 percent to $9.6 billion on the back of strong sales of chips and petroleum products, logging the second-largest export volume for any February. Exports to India expanded 18.6 percent to a record $1.7 billion for February, and outbound shipments to the Middle East increased 19.6 percent to $1.7 billion. Exports to the European Union shed 8.1 percent to $5.2 billion. ""Exports hit a bump in January but rebounded in February to log a trade surplus,"" Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said, adding South Korea's exports are showing strong competitiveness despite heightened global uncertainties sparked by the U.S. government's protectionist trade policies. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)","(2nd LD) S.

Ahn made the request as he met with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer, U.S. Secretary of Interior and National Energy Dominance Council Chairman Doug Burgum, and other officials during his trip to Washington, D.C., this week, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. Ahn's trip came amid mounting concerns over the plan of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to impose 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, as well as to introduce reciprocal tariffs, and his consideration of new tariffs on cars, chips and pharmaceuticals. It marked the first visit to Washington by a ministerial official from Seoul since Trump took office last month. ""I have relayed South Korean businesses' concerns over tariff plans (to the U.S. side) and requested exemptions,"" Ahn said during a meeting with reporters near Washington. ""We plan to proceed with related discussions (with the U.S.) through working-level consultative bodies in a direction that minimizes potential damage to Korean enterprises."" Seoul is said to have underscored its position to the U.S. that it aims to secure tariff exemptions first and foremost, and that if it fails to get exemptions, it hopes to at least ensure that South Korea is not put at a disadvantage compared with other countries. In a meeting with Lutnick, Ahn conveyed Korean companies' concerns over Washington's tariff scheme, according to the industry ministry. Lutnick is said to have highlighted the need to address U.S. trade deficits and expressed hope for related cooperation with South Korea. The two sides also discussed bolstering their partnership in strategic industries, such as shipbuilding and advanced industries. To further discuss the issues, Ahn and Lutnick agreed to install respective working-level consultative bodies for talks on tariff plans and shipbuilding cooperation, the ministry said. Ahn is also said to have explained to the U.S. that when a Georgia factory of Hyundai Motor Co. starts its operation in earnest late next month, it could help substantially reduce U.S. trade deficits stemming from South Korean auto exports. In separate meetings with Greer and Burgum, the Korean industry minister discussed strengthening bilateral cooperation in energy and trade. The ministry said Ahn also met with Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who introduced a bill aimed at revitalizing the U.S. shipbuilding and maritime industries, to exchange views on bolstering cooperation in the sector. Ahn also met with Kevin D. Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation; John J. Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies; and Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, to discuss Seoul's strategy on U.S. trade policies. ""South Korea will work to earn the best results from systematic and earnest negotiations with the U.S. on new industry, trade and energy policies based on our experience of successfully responding to the U.S. CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act in the past,"" Ahn said in a press release. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) Industry minister asks U.S. to exclude S.

Negotiators from German election winner Friedrich Merz’s conservative bloc and the center-left Social Democrats started exploratory talks Friday on a possible coalition government, but were tightlipped on the details as they launched what could be a complicated process.Merz’s Union bloc, which has led the opposition since 2021, won Sunday’s election, in which the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany took second place. 

The only plausible choice of coalition partner for the Union — which like other mainstream parties rules out working with Alternative for Germany — is the Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. They slumped to third place and their worst post-World War II result in a German parliamentary election on Sunday.Between them, the Union and Social Democrats have 328 seats in the newly elected 630-seat parliament.

In a brief statement after a first round of talks on Friday, the two sides said the discussions “began in an open and constructive atmosphere.” They said that Finance Minister Jörg Kukies offered an overview of Germany’s budget situation and upcoming talks will discuss “the challenges.” 

Another round will be held next week, according to the statement, which gave no specific date. At some point, negotiators will have to decide whether to move on to formal coalition talks.The possible partners will have to reconcile contrasting proposals for revitalizing the economy, which has shrunk for the past two years, and for curbing irregular migration — an issue that Merz pushed hard during the election campaign. They will also need to overcome distrust generated during the campaign.

Merz has said he hopes to do a deal by Easter. That may be an optimistic timeframe, although other recent governments have been in place within two or three months of an election.

https://apnews.com/article/ontario-canada-election-doug-ford-d81f6b94cfbd3ad038362432cd8c3c53,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Ontario Premier Doug Ford won reelection to lead Canada’s most populous province on Thursday, giving him the mandate he wanted to fight tariffs threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump. “Donald Trump thinks he can break us,” Ford told a cheering crowd at a Toronto convention center. “He thinks he can divide and conquer, pit region against region. Donald Trump doesn’t know what we know. “Let me be clear. Canada will never, ever be the 51st state. Canada is not for sale.” Unofficial results from Elections Ontario showed Ford’s Progressive Conservative Party would win a majority, giving him his third term as premier. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal Party will choose a new leader March 9, congratulated Ford on his victory. “At this crucial time, we must work together to defend Canadian interests, protect workers and businesses, and grow our economy,” Trudeau said in a statement. Ford called the election on Jan. 29, more than a year early. The Conservatives already held a majority with 79 seats. At the time, Ford said he needed a four-year mandate to protect Ontario, Canada’s manufacturing and automobile hub. Trump has threatened to implement 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports, with a lower 10% levy on energy, beginning Tuesday. He has also angered Canadians by talking about Canada becoming the the 51st U.S. state. During his speech, Ford said during his time as premier he has shown he will work with anyone to achieve results. “As we stare down the threat of Donald Trump’s tariffs, I will continue to do just that,” he said. “I will work with every level of government and every political stripe. Fighting back against Donald Trump, standing up for Canada, will take a full Team Ontario effort. It will take a full Team Canada effort.” During the campaign Ford made two trips to Washington to speak to U.S. government and business leaders about the tariffs. Ford has said his government is prepared to spend “tens of billions of dollars” to protect jobs and the economy of Ontario, and he has mused about making Americans pay more for the electricity Ontario sends to the U.S. Opposition parties accuse Ford of calling an early election before any potential charges emerge from a police investigation into his now-scrapped plan to develop lands under environmental protection. They also said the cost of the election could have been better spent on health care and affordable housing. Jonathan Malloy, a political scientist at Carleton University in Ottawa, said the tariff threats gave Ford the excuse he needed to call an early election. “Canadians are concerned with the Trump tariffs,” Malloy said. “Mr. Ford is being seen as being out front, responding to them. That’s politically advantageous for him.” With a population of around 16 million, Ontario is the Canadian province with the most people and an economy that makes up 38% of Canadian GDP. Unofficial results from Elections Ontario showed the Progressive Conservatives winning 82 seats, the New Democratic Party 25, the Liberals 14 and the Greens two, while one seat was won by an independent. When the election was called, the NDP had 28 seats, the Liberals had nine and the Greens had two, with six independents. A majority government requires at least 63 seats. The NDP under leader Marit Stiles returned as the official opposition while Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie failed to be reelected. Stiles said the people had spoken. “They re-elected the government hoping they would protect them against tariffs,” she said. “The threat is real.” During the campaign, Crombie promised to connect every Ontarian to a family doctor while Stiles addressed health care and affordability. Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner made promises about building more housing, protecting farmland and improving affordability. “I think this had been a very low-profile election,” said Malloy. “When Canadians are asked about the number one public issue these days, I’m sure they would say the Trump tariffs. That has overshadowed the election.”",Doug Ford reelected as Ontario’s premier with mandate to fight Trump tariffs,Jim Morris,AP News,2025-02-27T03:40:34,2025-02-27T23:25:33,gemini-2.0-flash

Choi made the remarks at a ceremony marking the March 1 Independence Movement in Seoul. He spoke on behalf of President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose official duties have been suspended following his brief imposition of martial law in December. This year marks the 106th anniversary of the nationwide uprising against Japanese colonial rule, a pivotal moment in Korea's fight for independence during Japan's 1910-45 occupation of the Korean Peninsula. ""Today, shadows of conflict and division are growing darker in our society,"" Choi said, apparently referring to weeks of protests and the growing divide between Yoon's supporters and opponents. He pointed to ideological, generational, regional and class-based divisions, warning the future of the nation could be at risk if such issues are not addressed. ""To overcome the crisis before us and build a nation that future generations can take pride in, national unity is more important than ever,"" he stressed. Choi, who also serves as finance minister, highlighted economic challenges following a downward revision of South Korea's growth outlook due to prolonged political uncertainty and rising global trade protectionism. ""Geopolitical risks are intensifying worldwide, economic and trade uncertainties are growing, and international relations are rapidly shifting,"" he said. He vowed that the government will accelerate economic recovery by revitalizing the livelihoods of ordinary citizens and creating more jobs. The acting president also emphasized the importance of ""sustainability,"" which he said could be achieved through reform measures in various sectors, as well as policies aimed at balanced regional development in a country where wealth and infrastructure are heavily concentrated in the greater Seoul area. Choi further expressed hope for a new chapter in South Korea-Japan relations as this year marks the 60th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two.

https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-zelenskyy-set-to-meet-at-white-house/7991244.html,"WHITE HOUSE —
 A White House meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy aimed at securing a deal that would allow the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare mineral rights turned into a heated exchange with the two leaders talking over each other and Trump telling Zelenskyy, ""You're either going to make a deal or we're out.""
In a statement on social media after the meeting, Trump indicated the proposed deal is off.
""I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,"" Trump wrote.
""He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.""
The heated exchange, witnessed by dozens of American and Ukrainian reporters in the Oval Office, took a combative tone about 40 minutes into the meeting when Zelenskyy raised Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea.
U.S. Vice President JD Vance immediately criticized Zelenskyy, accusing him of engaging in a ""propaganda tour.""
""I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,"" he told Zelenskyy.
Vance and Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of not being thankful for the assistance his country has received from Washington.
""You don't have the cards right now,"" Trump said, raising his voice as Zelenskyy tried to rebut him. ""You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III.""
Zelenskyy left the White House early, and a scheduled joint press conference was canceled.
Later Friday, Trump told reporters before leaving the White House that the talks ""didn't work out exactly great.""
Trump said that if the U.S. signs the mineral deal, it is his impression that Zelenskyy is ""looking to go on and fight, fight, fight.""
""We are not looking to go into a 10-year war and play games,"" Trump said.
When asked by a reporter what Zelenskyy needs to do to restart talks, Trump responded, 'He's got to say, 'I want to make peace.'""
Zelenskyy response
Despite the abrupt end to the meeting, the Ukrainian leader took to social media soon after it ended to address the American public and U.S. leadership.
""Thank you America,"" Zelenskyy posted on the X social media platform. ""Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.""
Later Friday, Zelenskyy told Fox News that he believes the relationship between Ukraine and the U.S. can be salvaged and said he does not want to lose the United States as a partner. He added, however, he wants Trump to be ""more on our side.""
When asked if he should apologize to Trump, Zelenskyy said, ""I think that we have to be very open and very honest, and I'm not sure that we did something bad.""
Rare minerals deal
Before the meeting devolved, Trump said he was close to signing the deal with Zelenskyy.
""We have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging, and working and getting some of the rare earth,"" Trump told a visibly uncomfortable Zelenskyy.
The proposed deal included provisions for the co-ownership and management of a postwar reconstruction fund for Ukraine, to which Ukraine would allocate 50% of future revenues from the country's natural resources.
But a White House spokesperson said the agreement was not signed.
No media source currently available
Fallout
House Democratic leader Hakeem Jefferies said in a statement: ""For three years, President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people have stood on the side of democracy, freedom and truth. Their success is in the national security interests of the United States. We should stand with Ukraine until victory is won.""
Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson wrote on Facebook: ""Thanks to President Trump — the days of America being taken advantage of and disrespected are OVER,"" adding what was seen in the Oval Office was an ""American President putting America first.""
The public collapse of talks between Trump and Zelenskyy was met with cheers from some Russian officials.
""The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office,"" Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia's National Security Council, posted on X.
Medvedev added that Trump ""is right: The Kiev [sic] regime is 'gambling with WWIII.'""
Zelenskyy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, defended the Ukrainian leader.
""The President is fighting for our country, for everyone who stands for a just and lasting peace,"" Yermak posted on X. ""Without real guarantees, war will return.""
Responses from Europe
European officials, including from France, Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, also took to social media to voice support for Ukraine.
""Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine,"" said European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs Kaja Kallas, posting on X.
'We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the aggressor,"" Kallas said. ""Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.""
First White House meeting
Trump and Zelenskyy have had in-person engagements in the past, but Friday marks their first one at the White House. Earlier this month, the pair spoke by phone after Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Since coming to office, Trump has increased his pressure campaign on Ukraine, claiming that Kyiv started the war with Russia and calling Zelenskyy a ""dictator."" Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Trump also has repeated a claim that the U.S. has spent $350 billion on Ukraine's war — a figure that far eclipses the amount recorded by the Department of Defense and the interagency oversight group that tracks U.S. appropriations to Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Trump is pursuing direct negotiations with Russia without the involvement of Kyiv or European allies. He defended them during his Thursday press conference as ""common sense.""
He described the talks as ""very well advanced"" but cautioned that there is only a narrow window to secure a deal to end the war. He expressed confidence that Putin will ""keep his word"" and not launch further aggression on Ukraine should a peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv be reached.

https://www.jpost.com/international/internationalrussia-ukraine-war/article-844170,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky left the White House early on Friday after a contentious Oval Office meeting with US President Donald Trump, a White House official said. Minutes before Zelensky's premature departure, the US president and his Vice President JD Vance shared an explosive confrontation with the Ukrainian president, in which Trump accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for the support provided by the United States. Watch this carefully. Very important. Vance accused Zelensky of being “disrespectful” and demanded he thank Trump. Trump warned that failing to accept a US-led peace deal with Russia, which invaded Ukraine in 2022, would mean “gambling with World War III.” “You’re either going make a deal or we’re out,” Trump added. “And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out and I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.” ""You don't have the cards. Once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. But you're not acting at all thankful, and that's not a nice thing. I'll be honest. That's not a nice thing."" Zelensky openly challenged Trump over his softer approach toward Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to ""make no compromises with a killer."" He also pushed back on Trump's claims that Ukrainian cities have been reduced to rubble by three years of war. Trump stressed that Putin wants to make a deal. After the exchange, Trump posted on his Truth Social account that Zelensky was not ready to end the war but could ""come back when he is ready for peace."" “We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved,"" Trump wrote, ""because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.” Trump-Zelensky summit explodes: ""He can come back when he is ready for peace"" Trump later told reporters on Friday that  Zelensky did not look like a man who wanted peace. The agreement negotiated in recent days would open Ukraine's vast mineral wealth to the United States but does not include explicit American security guarantees for Ukraine, a disappointment for Kyiv. Trump says the presence of Americans in business would serve as a form of guarantee. How much the deal would be worth to the United States is not spelled out. Trump has said he expects to gain hundreds of billions of dollars. Zelensky has said he would not sign an agreement that would put his country in debt for generations. Ukraine would contribute 50% of ""all revenues earned from the future monetization of all relevant Ukrainian Government-owned natural resource assets"" to a reconstruction fund jointly owned and managed by the United States and Ukraine. The agreement does not specify how the funds would be spent, or identify specific assets it covers, though it says they would include deposits of minerals, oil and natural gas as well as infrastructure such as gas terminals and ports. The Washington talks are a diplomatic boost for Zelensky who has repeatedly spoken of the importance of meeting Trump in person before the US president holds talks with Putin. ""The Ukrainians have been quite savvy at turning it round, and using this (the minerals deal) as an opening to engage the US,"" said a senior Kyiv-based European diplomat, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Kyiv hopes the agreement will spur Trump to back Ukraine's war effort, and potentially even win support from Republicans in Congress for a new round of aid. Ukraine has rapidly expanded its defense industry production but remains heavily reliant on foreign military assistance, while also struggling to replenish manpower as it battles a much larger foe. While Ukraine repelled Russia's invasion from the outskirts of Kyiv and recaptured swathes of territory in 2022, Russia still controls around a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly taking ground since a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023.

The meeting with Donald Trump had been seen as a potential diplomatic win for Volodymyr Zelensky in his pursuit of a security guarantee from the United States in return for joint investment in Ukraine’s critical minerals – a move that could also counter Chinese dominance of the resources. However, the initially cordial meeting in the Oval Office devolved in front of US and international media as Zelensky – pressed by US Vice-President J.D. Vance for not trusting Russian President Vladimir Putin – questioned the virtues of diplomacy with Moscow and Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of being disrespectful. Zelensky challenged Trump over his approach towards Putin, urging him to make “no compromises with a killer”. Trump responded: “You don’t have the cards. Once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position. But you’re not acting at all thankful, and that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest.

The Channel 12 report comes soon after it is said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold consultations this evening with senior ministers and defense officials on the subject of the hostage-ceasefire deal. It is rare for the premier to hold such discussions on a Friday evening, the Jewish Sabbath. An Israeli delegation dispatched to Cairo yesterday for “intensive” talks on the future of the Gaza hostage-ceasefire deal with Hamas was said to have proposed the first phase extension. Hamas reportedly opposes the extension and insists on proceeding to the second phase of the deal as originally agreed. The second phase is meant to include steps leading to a permanent end to the war, including a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Strip. A diplomatic source said the Israeli delegation was to return from Cairo Friday night. Supporting The Times of Israel isn’t a transaction for an online service, like subscribing to Netflix.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/frontline-countries-pitch-e10-billion-defence-line-for-russia-belarus-border/,"In a document sent to the European Commission, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania outline details for the creation of a defence line on the border with Belarus and Russia, and put price tags on several continent-wide defence projects. The document is intended to influence the drafting of the White paper on the future of the bloc’s defence, which is expected to identify major defence projects in which Europeans should invest for the benefit of all, and where to find the money. The list of projects first reported by Euractiv, has been repeatedly confirmed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in recent weeks. The North-East Border Shield is under consideration, along with ammunition stockpiles, an air defence shield, or maritime domain awareness. It would bring together Poland's Eastern Shield, the Baltic states' Baltic Defence Line, and could include Finland's 1,340-kilometre-long border with Russia and countries to the south. According to the calculations of Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the investment needed for this project is around €8-10 billion for a long list of items. For the frontline states, protecting the border with Russia and Belarus is key to defending the European Union. It first became an obvious point of tension after Moscow and Minsk organised what the Europeans called “instrumentalised migration”, in an attempt to divide and destabilise the Europeans. Since Moscow attacked Ukraine three years ago, fortifying the border has only become a higher priority for the neighbouring countries. “We need to take urgent actions to increase counter-mobility, enhance air surveillance and air defence, electronic defence, and underwater security of our borders,” the countries write in a document seen by Euractiv. In their list, they propose that EU countries jointly invest in infrastructure with fortifications, high-tech border surveillance systems, electronic warfare capabilities, drones and counter-drone measures. It also includes warehouses to store equipment, fuel, ammunition and explosives, as well as logistics for transport and shelters. They are also asking for more regulation. Though they are calling for a ""robust line of defence covering land, air, sea and other relevant domains"" along the EU's border with Russia and Belarus, the countries do not include sophisticated air and missile defence systems, fighter jets or navel assets in their shopping list, which would add significantly to the price tag. For reference, a European air defence shield would amount to €500 billion, the European Commission estimates. Later in the document, they estimate that protecting the necessary underwater infrastructure from cyber-attacks, sabotage and other threats would cost at least €2 billion at EU level. With this pot of money, they recommend the creation of a ""modular and multi-layered underwater defence dome, including surveillance, monitoring and potential counter-defence capabilities"" and the establishment of an information exchange on threats and accidents. Improving the military mobility of troops and equipment on the continent should also benefit from €10 billion, they said. In total, the EU should provide €100 billion to boost the continent's defence capabilities by 2028, on top of national investments, they added. A total of €50 billion at EU level should be spent on stockpiling ammunition and missiles, in addition to national investments, the document says. This could help companies to stockpile essential components such as propellants, explosives and shells, the four countries write, highlighting a move foreseen in the EU Defence Industry Programme (EDIP) currently under negotiation. Ammunition and missiles have proved to be essential equipment in a war, alongside more advanced technologies. European munition stockpiles for Ukraine are security guarantees, France added. “Stocks of weapons in Europe, perhaps also paid for by Europeans for Ukraine” also count as “security guarantees,” French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu said on Thursday. When it comes to production and procurement, EU-level programmes for joint procurement (EDIRPA) and production (ASAP) of ammunition and missiles could be extended to include “battle-decisive munitions alongside 155mm artillery ammunition, notably anti-tank, loitering, and air defence munitions,” they also write. Widening the scope of the two initiatives to include more types of equipment could bring faster results, some diplomats have suggested, although their legal regimes would make it complicated, a Commission official said.",Frontline countries pitch €10 billion defence line for Russia-Belarus border,Aurélie Pugnet,EURACTIV,2025-02-28T13:01:15,2025-02-28T13:01:15,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-minister-anneliese-dodds-quit-keir-starmer-slashe-aid-boost-defense-spending/,"LONDON — Anneliese Dodds resigned as Britain's international development minister Friday after the government cut overseas aid contributions to fund increased defense spending. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Tuesday that international development funding would fall from 0.5 percent to 0.3 percent of  gross national income from 2027 in a bid to fund a defense spending increase. He insisted it was ""not an announcement I am happy to make” and that the U.K. would continue playing a humanitarian role in Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza. But Dodds, resigning Friday, warned it would be ""impossible to maintain these priorities given the depth of the cut"" and said the effect ""would be far greater than presented."" The former development minister, who previously served as Starmer's shadow chancellor, warned the move would likely lead to a British withdrawal from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations ""at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence."" She also claimed the U.K. would have a reduced voice in the G7, G20 and World Bank and be ""shut out"" of multiple  multilateral bodies. She earned against the decision being portrayed as following Trump's own ""slipstream of cuts"" to the U.S. Agency for International Development. Dodds said she had delayed her resignation until Starmer's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump Thursday was complete so you ""had a united Cabinet behind you."" But losing a close ally will be seen as a blow for the prime minister after his engagement with Trump went down positively. In a letter responding to Dodds Friday, Starmer praised her “hard work, deep commitment and friendship,” and left the door open to her return by saying she “will have more to contribute in the future.” But he mounted a robust defense of his move to cut aid, arguing it was not a decision taken without consideration of the consequences and insisting the government will try to find a path back to restoring development spending. “The decision I have taken on the impact on ODA was a difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly,” he said, according to a copy of the letter provided by No.10 Downing Street. “We will do everything we can to return to a world where that is not the case and to rebuild a capability on development. However, protecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government and I will always act in the best interests of the British people.” Former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, a Conservative, backed Dodds' decision to quit. ""Labour’s disgraceful and cynical actions demean the Labour Party ‘s reputation as they balance the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world,"" the Tory MP told POLITICO. ""Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle."" Development spending was previously cut by the Tories from 0.7 to 0.5 percent in 2021 in response to Covid-19. The party also scrapped Britain’s dedicated aid department under Boris Johnson.

Modi said after meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that the two sides have directed their teams to conclude the bilateral free trade deal by end of this year. Modi said many decisions were taken to “elevate and accelerate India-EU partnership” in the meeting. “India-EU strategic partnership is natural. Its core is trust and shared belief in democratic values,” Modi said. The European Commission chief said the “free trade agreement between the EU and India would be the largest deal of this kind anywhere in the world.” Brussels is ramping up efforts to seal with deal with New Delhi in the face of potential U.S. tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the EU with tariffs of 25%. “It is time to be pragmatic and ambitious. And to realign our priorities for today’s realities,” von der Leyen said at an address to a think tank in New Delhi before meeting with Modi. “You can count on my full commitment to make sure we can deliver.” Related Stories India will include caste details in its next census Rubio calls India and Pakistan in effort to defuse crisis over Kashmir attack Indian survivors of Kashmir attack say gunmen asked if they were Hindus and opened fire The European Commission chief is in India on a two-day visit from Thursday and is accompanied by top leaders of EU member nations. India and the EU relaunched talks on the bilateral agreement in 2021, but issues like market access for products such as cars and alcoholic beverages have been sticking points. The next round of negotiations is set to take place in March. India and the EU cooperate closely on issues including foreign policy, security and technology. The EU is India’s largest trading partner, ahead of the U.S. and China. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, exports and imports to the European bloc accounted for more than $130 billion, marking an increase of about 90% over the past decade. Over 6,000 European companies are also present in India. Von der Leyen said the EU and India have the potential to be one of the defining partnerships of this century. “I want this visit to be the start of this new era. Prime Minister Modi and I share the same view. It is time to take our EU-India Strategic Partnership to the next level,” she said. For New Delhi, the trade talks have renewed significance after Trump’s decision to impose reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from countries including India. Last year India signed a trade agreement with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, who comprise the European Free Trade Association, that includes a commitment of $100 billion in investments.

https://apnews.com/article/senegal-casamance-rebels-peace-47df8201d4be0259309b8497b5996e91,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — A new peace deal between Senegal and a separatist rebel group in the country’s southern region has been touted by the government as a key step in ending one of Africa’s longest conflicts. Analysts, however, say it did not involve all the rebels and fails to address the root causes of the conflict. The deal, signed by the government and the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance was announced by Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko during a visit to neighboring Guinea-Bissau on Monday. Past peace deals have failed to end the fighting in the Casamance region, which is separated from the rest of Senegal by the nation of Gambia and has historically suffered from lower development rates and access to markets in the more prosperous north. The rebels have been fighting for Casamance’s independence since the early 1980s, arguing that the region has suffered neglect by the government. Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko touted the latest peace agreement as an important step in ensuring lasting peace in Casamance, home to some 1.6 million people. The deal offered a presidential pardon for imprisoned rebels as well as amnesty and a social reintegration path for other rebels, according to Vincent Foucher, a political scientist at the France-based National Center for Scientific Research, with knowledge of the agreement. However, it involves only a faction of the rebel group that is less potent than two others and excludes the hardline faction led by Salif Sadio, the most powerful of the rebel leaders, said Foucher. “I don’t see a solution yet. It’s a continuation of endless discussions with a divided movement,” he said. “The Senegalese state is not prepared to make the political or administrative concessions demanded by the other factions that have not signed the peace agreement.” Senegal’s government did not immediately respond to AP’s inquiry for comments about the claims. The rebels’ calls for the region’s independence will be difficult to neglect despite the new deal, said Mohamed Traoré, a doctoral researcher at the Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar. “Casamance nationals, especially the young, are proud to belong to the Senegalese state today, but the MFDC’s hard wing continues to call for independence,” said Traoré. The rebels have not publicly spoken about the deal.  However, Amidou Djiba, a spokesman for one of the factions not involved in the peace deal, earlier this year accused Senegal’s government of “choosing the people it talks to,” a trend he said would not help the return of peace in the region. ___ Ahmed reported from Bamako, Mali.",Senegal has signed a deal with separatist rebels.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-02-27-2025-cfcdd8786afe4bc73ae79b3e0e4ccb3b,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Negotiations between Israel and Hamas on the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire began Thursday, Egypt said, averting a collapse ahead of Saturday’s expiration of the agreement’s first phase. Officials from Israel, Qatar and the United States started “intensive discussions” on the ceasefire’s second phase in Cairo, Egypt‘s state information service said. “The mediators are also discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region,” its statement said. Phase 2 talks are meant to negotiate an end to the war, including the return of all remaining hostages in Gaza who are alive, and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the territory. Return of remaining deceased hostages would happen in Phase 3. According to Israel, there are 59 remaining hostages — 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. It will be difficult to reconcile a deal with the war objectives of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has called for dismantling Hamas’ governing and military capabilities. After suffering heavy losses in the war, Hamas has nonetheless emerged intact during the ceasefire, and the group says it will not give up its weapons. Hours before talks began, an Israeli official said the country would not withdraw from a strategic corridor in the Gaza Strip as called for under the ceasefire, a refusal that could severely complicate negotiations with Hamas and key mediator Egypt at a sensitive moment for the fragile truce. Overnight, Hamas released the remains of four hostages in exchange for over 600 Palestinian prisoners, the last planned swap of the ceasefire’s first phase. U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, was expected in the region in the coming days.  An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the army needed to remain in the so-called Philadelphi corridor, on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, to prevent weapons smuggling. Separately, Defense Minister Israel Katz said at a meeting with local leaders that he had seen tunnels penetrating the border on a recent visit to the corridor, without providing evidence or elaborating on Israel’s plans. Egypt says it destroyed the smuggling tunnels from its side years ago and set up a military buffer zone to halt smuggling. Hamas said any Israeli attempt to maintain a buffer zone in the corridor would be a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire agreement. The militant group says that sticking to the agreement is the only way for Israel to secure the release of dozens of hostages still held in Gaza. Israel was supposed to begin withdrawing from the Philadelphi corridor on Saturday, the last day of the first phase, and complete it within eight days. There was no immediate comment about the corridor from Egypt, which is opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of its border. The remains released Thursday were confirmed to be those of Ohad Yahalomi, Itzhak Elgarat, Shlomo Mantzur and Tsachi Idan, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents families of the captives. Mantzur, 85, was killed in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, and his body was taken into the territory. Israel said the other three were killed in captivity, without elaborating. “Our hearts ache upon receiving the bitter news,” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said. “In this painful moment, there is some solace in knowing that they will be laid to rest in dignity in Israel.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he shared the “immense pain” of the family and loved ones of Yahalomi, who had French citizenship. Hamas confirmed that over 600 prisoners had been released overnight. Most were detainees returned to Gaza, where they had been rounded up after the Oct. 7 attack and held without charge on security suspicions. Dozens of Palestinian teenagers as well as women detained by Israel in Gaza were released Thursday back to hugs and tears from their loved ones. The teenagers looked gaunt and skinny as they disembarked from Red Cross buses in the southern town of Khan Younis. Many fell into the arms of relatives, who spent days waiting for them after Israel held up their release last weekend to protest what it called cruel treatment of hostages by Hamas during their releases. Women cried and hugged the boys. The Palestinian prisoners club, a group representing current and former prisoners, said those released into Gaza Thursday were 44 male teenagers aged 15-19 and two women. In a separate prisoner release overnight, some fell to their knees in gratitude after disembarking in Khan Younis. In the West Bank town of Beitunia, dozens of prisoners were welcomed by crowds of relatives and well-wishers. Israel had delayed the release of the prisoners on Saturday over Hamas’ practice of parading hostages before crowds and cameras during their release. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have called the ceremonies humiliating for the hostages. Hamas released the four bodies to the Red Cross in Gaza overnight without a public ceremony. The prisoners released Thursday included 445 men, 21 teenagers and one woman, according to lists shared by Palestinian officials that did not specify their ages. Only around 50 Palestinians were released into the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem in this round, while dozens sentenced to life over deadly attacks against Israelis were exiled. The latest handover was the final one planned under the ceasefire’s first six-week phase, which expires this weekend. Hamas has returned 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to return all the hostages and destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas, which remains in control of Gaza. The Trump administration has endorsed both goals.  But it’s unclear how Israel would destroy Hamas without resuming the war, and Hamas is unlikely to release the remaining hostages — its main bargaining chips — without a lasting ceasefire. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of war that erupted after Hamas’ 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. About 250 people were taken hostage.  Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say over half the dead have been women and children. The fighting displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population and decimated the territory’s infrastructure and health system. In northern Israel, police said a driver rammed his car into people at a highway bus stop, wounding at least eight Thursday in what authorities believe was a militant attack. Police said they had “neutralized” the suspect, who they described as a 53-year-old Palestinian from the northern West Bank who lived in Israel and was married to an Israeli citizen. Medical workers said the ramming injured at least eight people, two in serious condition, who they evacuated to the hospital. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip and Melzer from Nahariya, Israel.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250227000400315,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 (Yonhap) -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday the United States will not ""abandon"" relations with its two East Asian treaty allies, South Korea and Japan, as he addressed a question over America's defense commitment to Taiwan. Rubio made the remarks in a Fox News interview, amid lingering concerns that under President Donald Trump's America First credo and his perceived transactional foreign policy approach, the U.S.' security commitments to allies could weaken. ""We have to be present in the Indo-Pacific. They're trying to drive us out,"" he said, apparently referring to his view on China's intentions. ""We are a Pacific nation ... So, we have relationships in the Pacific, and we're not going to abandon those -- Japan, South Korea."" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio looks on as he meets with Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, and Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya at the State Department in Washington on Jan. 21, 2025 in this file photo released by Reuters. (Yonhap) The secretary also affirmed the U.S.' ""longstanding"" position on Taiwan that America is ""against any forced, compelled, coercive change in the status of Taiwan."" ""That's been our position since the late 1970s, and that continues to be our position, and that's not going to change,"" he said. On China, Rubio said that the U.S. has to deal with the reality that China will be a ""rich and powerful"" country, but stressed that the U.S. cannot allow for a world in which ""China is so powerful that we (have to) depend on them."" ""That's right now where we're headed, unfortunately. That's going to change under President Trump,"" the secretary said. He underlined the need for the U.S. to have its own domestic capabilities to ensure it does not have to rely on China. ""We've allowed way too many industries to fall into the hands of the Chinese, everything from rare earth minerals to pharmaceuticals,"" he said. ""We have to have a domestic capacity, and it's one of the ideas behind the tariffs that the President is pursuing writ large."" He also pointed out that the U.S. is lagging behind China's shipbuilding capacity, which he said amounts to a ""very serious vulnerability."" ""We have our aircraft manufacturing, our ship manufacturers. They are not keeping pace. China can build 10 ships before we can build one,"" he said. ""That's a very serious vulnerability that cannot continue. And obviously, I know (Defense Secretary) Pete has a plan for that, and the President has a plan for that, and they're working on it."" Optimism for shipbuilding cooperation between South Korea and the U.S. has risen as Trump mentioned his intent to work with Korea in the shipbuilding industry during a call with President Yoon Suk Yeol in November. During a radio interview last month, Trump also said that the U.S. may use allies in its efforts to build naval vessels. sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)","Rubio says U.S. will not 'abandon' relations with S.

""Following about a monthlong lull, North Korean troops were placed back in the frontline region of Kursk starting in the first week of February,"" the National Intelligence Service (NIS) said in a note to the press. ""It appears that there has been a deployment of additional troops, but their size is still being examined,"" the NIS said. The assessment follows a news report that between 1,000 and 3,000 North Korean troops were newly transported to Kursk via Russian cargo ships and military airplanes between January and February in the second round of such troop deployment. Following the report, South Korean military officials said signs of North Korea dispatching more than 1,000 additional troops to Russia this year have been detected. North Korea is believed to have deployed approximately 11,000 troops to Russia's western frontline region of Kursk last year. The NIS has earlier assessed that North Korean troops deployed to Russia had been absent from combat in the Kursk region since mid-January, likely due to heavy casualties among them. The agency estimated that about 300 were killed and some 2,700 others were wounded. pbr@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) N. Korea appears to have deployed additional troops to Russia: S.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-844014,"The Israeli and Qatari delegations arrived in Cairo to continue negotiations regarding the Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal, the Egyptian Information Ministry announced on Thursday night, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the hostage-ceasefire deal delegation to leave for the Egyptian capital. An American delegation is also participating in the talks regarding the ceasefire agreement, the Egyptian ministry said. The delegation will be led by Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Persons, Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch, as well as ""M,"" an anonymous officer from the Shin Bet. M is the former deputy of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, who is reportedly no longer part of the hostage deal negotiating team. In a Thursday meeting with Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský in Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said, ""Our delegation will depart for Cairo to assess whether there is common ground for extending the framework in exchange for the return of more hostages."" Israeli officials told The Jerusalem Post that Israel wants and is willing to continue phase one of the deal. This would mean that three hostages would continue to be released each week in return for humanitarian aid and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Hamas has also recently stated that the only way the remaining hostages will be freed is through a commitment to a ceasefire deal. Israel aspires to have the next hostages released as early as Saturday, an Israeli source stated, stressing that no agreement has yet been reached. The decision to send the negotiating team to Cairo was made during a telephone security consultation led by the Prime Minister and attended by Ministers Israel Katz, Ron Dermer, Gideon Sa'ar and Bezalel Smotrich, and Shas Chairman Arye Deri. Earlier on Thursday, Defense Minister Katz saidÂ	""Israel is prepared to extend the ceasefire to bring back more hostagesâall of them. The most effective way to achieve this goal is a real and credible military threatâand that is the strategy."" However, he alsoÂ	 said that ""Phase one has ended; we have brought back 25 hostages alive, including the female soldiers. This was not at all the case in some of the earlier stages of the negotiations, where the discussion was about 10 or 12 hostages. We also brought back 8 who are no longer alive.""",Benjamin Netanyahu sends Gaza hostage deal team to Cairo for talks,"AMICHAI STEIN, JERUSALEM POST STAFF",The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-27T10:10:00,2025-02-27T17:59:00,gemini-2.0-flash

We will not allow the Hamas murderers to again roam our borders with pickup trucks and guns, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling,” the Israeli official says, maintaining that Hamas had been using the route to sneak weapons into Gaza. In July, when Israel’s hostage negotiating team believed that it was on the verge of a hostage deal with Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added new conditions aimed at maintaining Israel’s presence in the Philadelphi Corridor, thereby scuttling the talks, Israeli and Arab officials have told The Times of Israel. Ultimately, though, the deal Netanyahu accepted six months later still requires Israel to begin completing its withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor on the 42nd day of phase one — this coming Saturday — and to finish that pull-out by the 50th day of the ceasefire (March 9). The Israeli official’s announcement comes shortly after Israeli authorities finished identifying the last four bodies of hostages released in phase one.

https://apnews.com/article/haiti-un-gangs-c8864c7f813cd47e92d4b2f29ad7eeff,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres is proposing opening a U.N. office that would provide drones, fuel, ground and air transportation and other non-lethal support to a Kenyan-led mission in Haiti struggling to fight gangs, according to a letter obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press. The letter was sent to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday night and provides the first details for a proposal that Guterres announced last week at a summit with Caribbean leaders. At the time, Guterres said he would request that the U.N. assume funding for the mission’s structural and logistical expenses but did not provide further information. The main goal of taking over that funding would be to encourage countries to boost the mission’s numbers; it currently has some 1,000 personnel out of the 2,500 envisioned. In his letter, Guterres assessed the situation in Haiti and warned it was running out of time. “We must act quickly,” he wrote. “I am convinced that the phased approach of the United Nations’ support… can reverse the shocking and rising trend in gang violence.” Guterres said his proposal is a “realistic option,” adding that “at this stage, transitioning to a U.N. peacekeeping operation is not…a feasible option.” The proposal comes as gangs that already control 85% of Haiti’s capital seized new neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince in recent weeks. The attacks have left more than 6,000 people homeless in the past month, according to the U.N. “Entire families were killed in their homes, while others, including children and babies, were shot dead as they tried to escape,” the U.N. said in a statement Tuesday. Guterres said in the letter that the U.N. office he proposes could help strengthen Haiti’s National Police and help gather, store and share sensitive information related to operations, as well as provide a joint operations center, data mapping support and surveillance via drones. In turn, Guterres said BINUH, the latest U.N. political mission in Haiti, could focus on priorities including designing programs to help children and women forced to join gangs defect from them, as well as support authorities in the arrests and prosecutions of “high-risk individuals.” The Security Council previously extended the U.N.-backed mission in Haiti led by Kenyan police to October of this year even as the U.S. and other countries warn it is lacking personnel and funding. Guterres noted in his letter that while the mission has reached 1,000 personnel, the vast majority of them Kenyan police, it still only represents 40% of the 2,500 personnel envisioned. In addition, a U.N. trust fund that relies on voluntary contributions and helps fund the mission has only $110.8 million. “Much more is needed,” Guterres wrote. He proposes that the U.N.'s peacekeeping budget pay for the mission’s equipment and logistical support and that voluntary donations keep financing the salaries of the mission’s personnel. Guterres noted that “many” of the mission’s armored vehicles are ill-equipped for the urban environment in Port-au-Prince and that a lack of spare parts has rendered half of all its combat vehicles inoperable. Last year, more than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti, 1,000 more deaths than reported the previous year. Gang violence also has left more than one million people homeless in recent years, according to the U.N. As gang violence surges across Haiti’s capital and beyond, the international community is pushing the troubled Caribbean country to hold elections. Diego Da Rin, an analyst with International Crisis Group, opposed the idea in an online symposium on Wednesday. “It would be a mistake to think that having elections in chaotic conditions without resolving…the security issue first would, by miracle, completely change the situation,” he said. “The situation is extremely dire.” ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at ",AP obtains letter detailing UN chief's proposal to help mission in Haiti,Dánica Coto,AP News,2025-02-26T18:58:07,2025-02-26T17:23:56,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/china-new-zealand-peters-drills-1b222c1a5f0bc519551ab8c95035d3ec,"BEIJING (AP) — China has agreed to consider concerns that its military did not give enough notice before staging live-fire exercises in the waters between New Zealand and Australia last week, the foreign minister of New Zealand said Wednesday. The drills prompted passenger flights between the two countries to divert in midflight after Chinese naval vessels warned pilots they were flying above a live-fire exercise. “I think it would be true to say that he took our concerns on board,” Foreign Minister Winston Peters said after meeting and having dinner with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in the Chinese capital. Peters said he put the issue in the context of the close ties that the two countries have developed since 2008. China is the biggest export destination for New Zealand and Australia. “We’re in the second decade of this arrangement, and this is a failure in it at this time, and we’d like to have it corrected in the future,” he said. He added, “That is something which we believe is under consideration.” Australia has complained more vociferously about the lack of notification. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she sought an explanation from China’s Wang Yi when the two met in Johannesburg last Saturday following a gathering of foreign ministers from the Group of 20 nations. At issue is how much in advance militaries should issue such warnings. China only gave “a couple of hours’ notice,” New Zealand’s Defense Minister Judith Collins told Radio New Zealand, rather than the expected 12 to 24 hours. A longer lead time would give airlines time to plan alternate routes. Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. China’s official Xinhua News Agency made no mention of the issue in an initial report on Peters’ meeting earlier in the day with Chinese Vice President Han Zheng. A Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson defended China’s actions on Sunday, saying the drills were in compliance with international law and did not affect aviation safety. Peters, who also is the deputy prime minister, is in the middle of an 11-day trip that began with stops in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After Beijing, he is visiting Mongolia and South Korea before his return to New Zealand on Monday. In his talks in Beijing, Peters said the return of President Donald Trump to the White House came up more than he had expected. He didn’t provide any details, but said that both sides agreed that “perhaps we should just wait and see what happens when the dust settles.” Peters said he also explained the unique relationship his country has with Cook Islands, which signed a series of agreements with China earlier this month that have raised concern in New Zealand. The government was angered when Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown refused to share the text of a draft cooperation agreement with China ahead of its signing. Citizens of Cook Islands have New Zealand passports, and New Zealand helps the small Pacific nation with its military and foreign affairs. In return, the Cook Islands government is required to consult New Zealand on matters that could affect the latter. “They need to understand the constitutional arrangement, which they said they did now,” Peters said of China.",New Zealand says China has agreed to consider concerns about its recent military drills,KEN MORITSUGU,AP News,2025-02-26T06:04:05,2025-02-26T13:53:58,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/un-latvia-russia-ukraine-war-putin-trump-ed920ae9ff7fc3570018bf5ba8b3edaa,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Latvia’s foreign minister warns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will try to achieve in peace talks what he hasn’t been able to accomplish in his war against Ukraine — weaken the United States and restore control over his smaller neighbor. Baiba Braže spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday during a week of intense diplomacy between Europe and the United States following President Donald Trump’s upending of U.S. policy with his decision to hold direct talks with Russia, while excluding Ukraine and its European allies from the initial discussions. Braže notes that Russia, with a population of 140 million, has managed to gain control of less than 20% of Ukraine, population 40 million, since it seized Crimea in 2014 and launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has failed to weaken the U.S. and the NATO military alliance it leads, or to oust the democratic government in Kyiv. So, when it comes to seeking peace, “I think the difficulty is with the Russians, because Russians are the ones who want to weaken U.S. power, and who want to weaken the U.S. in the world overall,” Braže said. What the world is seeing, she said, is that when Putin interferes in other countries he wants to control both territory and the political choices of their governments. In Syria, for example, he supported the authoritarian regime of Bashar Assad and got military bases on the Mediterranean. But Putin hasn’t gotten what he wanted during the three-year war in Ukraine and “he will try to get it through the peace talks,” Braže said. “So, it’s important to clearly remember that perspective in whatever deal we negotiate or strike.” She said although only U.S. and Russian officials took part in last week’s talks in Saudi Arabia, “Europe is included” in the peace discussions because of constant communications with both the Ukrainians and the Americans. She has been in Washington three times since mid-December and said she was heading there later Tuesday for talks with lawmakers and administration officials. French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House on Monday, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was due to meet with him on Thursday. Braže stressed that Europe’s task now is to strengthen the transatlantic alliance and build up its own militaries and defense industries. Last week, Latvia announced it will increase defense spending to 4% of GDP next year and continue to move toward 5%. NATO members have agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. “We are investing in our own capability,” she said. “We wish all Europeans would do that. That’s one of the issues we are discussing.” As NATO members, Braže said, Latvia and the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia and Lithuania need to make sure they are prepared for any future aggression from Russia. She said their focus is on deterrence — early warning, rapid response, military capability and political will. The three Baltic states were occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II and fell under Soviet control after the war. Like Ukraine, they became independent countries with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Braže stressed Monday to the U.N. Security Council that “only Ukraine’s victory can ensure lasting security and put an end to Russia’s imperialist aggression.” “We strongly believe that a rushed ceasefire will not lead to sustainable peace; instead, it will only embolden Russia, encouraging further expansion and putting global security at grave risk,” she said. Macron said he had spoken to 30 European and allied leaders, with some saying they are willing to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine in a peace deal. Braže said that while there have been preliminary discussions, there is no peace process yet. When there is, she said, “We will be guided very much by the needs of Ukraine.” “For any security force, we need military guidance,” Latvia’s top diplomat said. “We need military advice. What type of force is there? Where? Are the troops withdrawn on the Russian side from the contact line? How far? What is the location of any security force?” But Braže said the most important thing is peace must be long-lasting, not just a ceasefire where war can restart again. “Nobody wants that,” she said.",Latvia FM: Putin will try to achieve in peace talks what he couldn't in Ukraine war — weaken the US,Edith M.

Lee of the Democratic Party (DP) is considered the presidential frontrunner in the event President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment is upheld, but confirmation of his lower court sentence of one year in prison, suspended for two years, would bar him from running in the next presidential election in 2027. The opposition leader is accused of lying during a media interview in December 2021 that he did not know the late Kim Moon-ki, a former executive of Seongnam Development Corp., which was behind a corruption-ridden development project in Seongnam, south of Seoul, when Lee was the city's mayor. During the final hearing of his appellate trial in the day, the prosecution said Lee deserves ""a heavy punishment for distorting voters' choices by telling a lie."" The court said it plans to reach a verdict on March 26. Lee Jae-myung (C), the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, arrives at the Seoul High Court on Feb. 26, 2025, to attend the final hearing of his appellate trial on election law violation charges. (Yonhap) Upon arrival at the Seoul High Court for the session, Lee told reporters: ""The court will make the right judgment ... In the ways of the world, everything is bound to flow in the direction of common sense and principles."" Lee is also accused of lying during a parliamentary audit of the Gyeonggi provincial government in October 2021 that he was under pressure from the land ministry to rezone the former site of the Korea Food Research Institute in Seongnam. The site was later developed into apartment complexes by a private developer, and allegations were raised that Lee rezoned the land to give preferential treatment to the company. In November, a lower court found him guilty of making false statements in violation of the Public Official Election Act and sentenced him to a suspended one-year prison term. hague@yna.co.kr(END)",(2nd LD) Prosecutors demand 2-yr prison term for opposition leader in election law violation case,Chang Dong-woo,Yonhap News Agency,2025-02-26T19:54:54,2025-02-26T19:54:54,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-843841,"Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said that Israel was looking to US President Donald Trump to pressure Iran into ending its efforts to gain nuclear weapons, warning that a “military option” may still be required, in an interview with Politico published on Wednesday. Sa’ar warned that time was running out to prevent Tehran from accessing nuclear weapons, and the Islamic regime had already enriched uranium capable of producing a “couple of bombs.” If efforts to stop the regime do not succeed, it would trigger a “nuclear race in the Middle East with Egypt, Saudis, Turkey,” he said. A quarterly UN nuclear watchdog report showed on Wednesday that Iran’s stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% of weapons-grade, has jumped since Iran announced a dramatic acceleration in enrichment in December. Two quarterly reports sent by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) to member states showed that while the stock of 60% material has grown by around half, there has been no real progress on resolving long-running outstanding issues with Iran, including the unexplained presence of uranium traces found at undeclared sites. “The significantly increased production and accumulation of highly enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon state to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,” the IAEA said in a passage that, unusually, was included in both reports. The stock of uranium refined to up to 60% in the form of uranium hexafluoride grew by 92.5 kg. in the past quarter to 274.8 kg, one of two confidential IAEA reports said. That is enough, in principle, if enriched further, for six nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick. One of the reports also spelled out the lack of progress on the outstanding issues, such as explaining the uranium traces, which the IAEA has been asking the Islamic Republic to do for years. “Iran states that it has declared all of the nuclear material, activities, and locations required under its Safeguards Agreement. This is inconsistent with the agency’s assessments of the unexplained nuclear-related activities that took place at all four of the undeclared locations in Iran referred to above,” the report said. “The agency is, therefore, at an impasse with regard to resolving these outstanding safeguards issues.” Stressing the need to halt Tehran, which has issued multiple anti-America statements and threats to Israel, Sa’ar said the regime would destabilize the entire Middle East region. Sa’ar noted that Tehran had already dedicated a number of resources to destabilizing the region, noting Iran had already trafficked weapons and money into the West Bank. A diplomatic path is still being pursued, he said while emphasizing that he did not believe such efforts would be fruitful. “I think that in order to stop a nuclear Iranian program before it will be weaponized, a reliable military option should be on the table,” he said.","'Military option' on table to halt Tehran's nuclear threat, Sa'ar warns",JERUSALEM POST STAFF,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-26T12:18:10,2025-02-26T15:55:00,gemini-2.0-flash

Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul made the remarks after a North Korean soldier held by Ukraine said in an interview with a South Korean daily last week that he wants to go to South Korea and that he was about ""80 percent sure"" of it. He was one of the two wounded North Korean soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces last month during combat in Russia's western Kursk border region. North Korea has sent around 11,000 troops in support of Moscow's war against Kyiv. ""If their intention to defect is clear, we must, of course, accept them as South Korean nationals and take necessary steps in accordance with the constitutional provisions,"" Cho said during a parliamentary session in response to a question by Rep.

Following the media report, the foreign ministry said the government is willing to provide protection and support if the North Korean soldiers express a desire to come to the South, in line with the principles and relevant laws regarding all North Korean individuals as its own. On relations with the United States under the second Donald Trump administration, Cho reiterated the pledge to work with Washington in areas that strategically matter to both countries, including shipbuilding and artificial intelligence, to explore the potential for further economic cooperation.

https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-impossible-choice-which-industries-should-survive-the-green-transition/,"NEUSS, Germany — On the left bank of the Rhine, the European Union’s third-largest aluminum smelter sits idle. No smoke rises from its four spindly chimneys; the giant pots, once filled to the brim with molten silvery liquid, have long cooled. They won’t fire up again.  When the Rheinwerk plant stopped smelting in 2023, citing exorbitant energy prices, it sent shockwaves through a country haunted by the threat of deindustrialization. The shutdown meant job losses and ended a 60-year tradition in Neuss, a midsized German city halfway between Cologne and the Dutch border. But behind three silent production halls, the factory now hums with round-the-clock activity. Furnaces roar, shredders rumble and electric trucks zip around the foundry. The Rheinwerk is still producing aluminum ingots the length of a minibus.  There’s just one difference: These metal blocks are made from trash — making them less energy-intensive and more sustainable than the freshly smelted stuff, known as primary aluminum. “We’re building one recycling furnace after another,” said Volker Backs, managing director of Speira, the company running the Rheinwerk. “We take the green transition seriously here.” It wasn’t an easy decision, said Backs, but a necessary one — for both profit and planet. “We were of course sorry that we couldn’t maintain primary production of aluminum here,” he added, “but we see recycling as our future.”  One of the Rheinwerk’s giant furnaces is used for re-melting aluminium waste. | Zia Weise The same hard choice awaits companies and governments across the continent: Prop up products and practices that are no longer competitive, or abandon them. Complicating the matter are soaring costs, fierce competition from China and a looming trade war with the United States. 	 Companies need to decide whether to ditch or pour money into parts of their businesses whose green transition will cost billions. And governments need to decide how — and whom — they help. Do they bet on future-oriented enterprises or retain creaky industrial sites? Europe’s strained public purses won’t subsidize it all.  On Wednesday, the European Commission will offer an initial answer with its Clean Industrial Deal. The EU executive’s plan will propose much-needed measures to slash energy prices and stimulate investment. But it will sidestep the thorniest question: Which sectors and products can and should the EU save — and which should it let die? Brussels can’t avoid this question forever. The response will determine not only what the EU’s industry and job market look like in the coming decades but also the bloc’s autonomy: Where it gets the aluminum for its wind turbines, the cement for its buildings or the steel for its weapons.  “It’s something I don’t see enough in the discourse — a transition means you need to make choices, and those choices need to be strategic and explicit,” said Domien Vangenechten, who researches European industrial policy at environmental think tank E3G. “And you cannot save everyone.”  The choices facing Europe  Europe has to make those choices now.  Skyrocketing energy prices hammered the continent’s long-struggling manufacturing industry after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Some companies, notably in the steel sector, say irreversible decline can only be staved off with immediate political and financial support.  Backs recalls that as electricity costs quadrupled in 2022, the power price to produce one metric ton of primary aluminum suddenly hit more than €5,000 — double the metal’s price on the global market. “You don't have to think very long about whether it's still worth it,” he said.  The price shock came at the worst possible time.  One of Speira’s employees painted this mural in the Rheinwerk’s sorting hall. | Zia Weise Unlike previous industrial transformations, the green transition has a deadline thanks to planetary physics: The faster we stop pumping carbon dioxide into the air, the less severe climate change will be. Scientists say that zeroing out global net emissions by 2050 will prevent the worst, and the EU has enshrined this target date in law.  Energy-intensive manufacturing sectors — a category including steel, cement, aluminum, chemicals and more — account for more than a fifth of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, and their transition will be lengthy and expensive. They’ll have to change their production processes, use clean energy, source more recycled materials and capture the remaining CO2. As modernizing a factory takes years, companies need to know now what’s worth investing in. They want certainty about the conditions they’ll face and what support they’ll receive. The Commission’s Clean Industrial Deal seeks to address many of the manufacturers’ concerns, proposing made-in-EU quotas to stimulate demand and new measures to upgrade power grids and lower prices.  At the same time, the EU executive steers well clear of picking winners and losers in the green transition.  Yet there are urgent decisions to be made about which industries the EU wants to retain, and where it’s cheaper and more effective to rely on imports. Former European Central Bank leader Mario Draghi spelled it out in his sweeping report on boosting the bloc’s competitiveness. “There are some technologies, like solar panels, where foreign producers are too far ahead and attempting to capture production in Europe will only set back decarbonization,” he said in a speech presenting the report to the European Parliament last year.  But, he added, there are other sectors “where we do not want to be fully dependent on foreign technology for strategic reasons, and so it is key to keep the know-how in Europe.” Aluminum’s role Where on that divide primary aluminum production will land is an open question. The metal is in everything from soda cans and window frames to military aircraft and missiles. Demand is also expected to soar in the coming decades given the importance of the lightweight material for climate-friendly technologies like wind turbines and electric vehicles.  The EU has recognized its strategic role, adding aluminum to its critical raw materials list. NATO followed suit last year, warning that the alliance’s supply of the metal is at “very high risk” of disruption.  Yet manufacturing fresh aluminum requires more electricity than any other industrial production method — more than double the average German’s annual power consumption for each ton of metal. (At the Rheinwerk, a massive connection cable allowed the factory to use as much power as Neuss’ 150,000 inhabitants combined.) Once the EU’s power grids are fully decarbonized, this process could run on 100 percent green energy. Plus, once expensive fossil fuels are out of the system, power prices should go down.  Manufacturers can’t wait for that. EU companies pay two or three times as much for electricity as their Chinese and American rivals, and the 2022 price shock was the final straw for many.  Speira was only one of many smelters across Europe that curtailed operations during the energy crisis. Within two years, the continent’s primary aluminum production halved.  By contrast, Europe’s production of so-called secondary aluminum, manufactured using recycled metal, has steadily increased. Its advantages are obvious: Secondary production requires 95 percent less energy than primary production — making for a significantly lower carbon footprint. One ton of European-produced primary aluminum emits 6.7 tons of CO2 during manufacturing. That drops to as little as 0.5 tons for aluminum made entirely from remelted waste. And in theory, aluminum is infinitely recyclable.  That isn’t to say secondary aluminum producers don’t face challenges. Key EU aluminum buyers — such as carmakers — are in trouble, affecting short-term demand. The sector is also facing low-cost competition from China, which has accelerated aluminum production. Plus, U.S. President Donald Trump just announced 25 percent tariffs on aluminum, hitting EU companies’ exports.  But production costs, particularly for energy, are the top problem for European industry — and some argue the price of keeping primary production afloat just isn’t worth it.  Industry associations and trade unions, however, warn against abandoning domestic primary production.  For now, the EU cannot cover its demand with recycled aluminum alone, said Rob van Gils, president of Germany’s aluminum association. One day that might be possible, given all the metal in use. But while the average soda can ends up back at a recycling facility within a few months, the material in window frames or wind turbines won’t become scrap for decades.  Investments in recycling capacity “will pay off over time,” van Gils said. “But we still have to keep this primary process in Europe, because otherwise we will be completely dependent on imports.”  That’s bad for Europe’s self-sufficiency — and the planet: Primary aluminum produced outside of Europe tends to be far more carbon-intensive. Chinese aluminum spews around twice the emissions of EU-made metal. Brussels faces choice Whether it’s worth keeping primary aluminum production in the EU is ultimately a political choice of the sort Brussels is rather bad at.  The entrance to the Rheinwerk aluminium factory. | Zia Weise The Commission’s power to make strategic decisions about the future of industry is limited. And even where the EU executive can make decisions, it needs buy-in from a majority of national governments.   “Trying to come up with a holistic vision is challenging,” Vangenechten said. “Trying to come up with a holistic vision and get 27 member states to implement that and work together is even trickier.”  When the Commission suggested banning sales of new combustion-engine cars after 2035 — deciding to bet on electric vehicles for the future — a massive backlash followed.  Carmakers, fuel producers and engine-manufacturing countries successfully lobbied for a loophole for cars running on synthetic fuels, giving combustion technology another lease on life — even though such fuels are expected to be scarce, expensive and inefficient.  Since the 2035 debate, Brussels has faced calls to ensure “technological neutrality” in all its policymaking and let the market alone decide what’s viable.  But industry isn’t a monolith, and the Commission faces competing demands.  Clean technology manufacturers — which Brussels also wants to support with its Clean Industrial Deal — are pressuring the EU not to walk back its ambitions, warning that zig-zagging on already-passed climate legislation risks undermining the political predictability they need.  Or take recycling: The aluminum and steel sectors are asking the EU to restrict exports of scrap metal to ensure a steady supply of recycled material. But Europe’s recycling industry — which derives significant income from exports — warns that this would damage them.  Brussels won’t be able to make everyone happy. But the sooner it makes those decisions, the smoother the transition will be.  “The last thing we want is for a bunch of old manufacturing industries to just milk out their old assets and try to get as much revenue out of them [as possible] and then just close things down,” Vangenechten said. “That way we’re just extending the problem, and in 20 years’ time there will be zero jobs.”  The future of aluminum Back at the Rheinwerk, workforce levels are expected to return soon to 2023 numbers as the company adds more recycling capacity. The factory is unionized and workers’ representatives were involved in Speira’s plan to stop smelting.  While some European smelters are restarting primary production now that power prices have fallen to pre-crisis levels, there is no going back for Speira. The Rheinwerk is already producing as much aluminum from recycled cans as it used to smelt from scratch. Now, instead of power-intensive electrolysis, the Rheinwerk process starts with sorting through a sea of used drink cans.  In the sorting hall, Speira’s employees set up a cabinet of curiosities they find — coins, license plates, a disturbing amount of yellow Minion keychains, decommissioned military munitions — and decorated a wall with a painting of planet Earth, flanked by two cans.  “A colleague asked if he could paint that,” said Marcel Tappert, deputy head of the Rheinwerk’s recycling and casting operations. “The staff here are very much aware that they are part of the circular economy. You see what goes in, and what comes out is a new can from which you’ll drink your beer in the summer.”  After sorting, the cans are shredded, filtered for impurities, softened in huge ovens and sent for remelting. The last two stages run on fossil gas, though Speira has started mixing in oxygen to lower emissions. Eventually, Tappert said, the Rheinwerk furnaces could run on hydrogen. But that depends on sufficient investments in pipelines to transport the clean-burning gas. “If we relied on trucks, we’d have a truck coming in here every five minutes.”  Speira is prepared to achieve climate neutrality across its entire value chain by 2045, but the company can’t go it alone, Backs said. The EU and national governments have to ensure the necessary infrastructure gets built.  If decision-makers in Brussels and EU capitals don’t do their part, there won’t be any companies left to decarbonize, he warned: “Policies that protect only the climate and don’t future-proof the economy are pointless. What’s supposed to become climate-neutral if there is nothing left?” Lucia Mackenzie contributed to this story. ",Europe’s impossible choice: Which industries should survive the green transition?,Zia Weise,POLITICO,2025-02-26T03:26:00,2025-02-26T08:06:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rferl.org/a/kremlin-putin-trump-european-troops-ukraine/33327524.html,"The Kremlin has declined to confirm a statement by U.S. President Donald Trump saying Russia is ready to ""accept"" European troops in Ukraine as part of a peace deal, although it left room for a potential agreement. Trump made his comments after meeting French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at the White House, responding to a question about a deployment. ""I have specifically asked [Russian President Vladimir Putin] that question. He has no problem with it,"" Trump said on February 24. This led to a question at a regular media briefing held by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov in Moscow on February 25. His answer? There was, he said, ""nothing to add"" to an earlier statement that the deployment of peacekeepers from NATO countries in Ukraine was unacceptable to Moscow. ""There is a position on this matter that was expressed by the Russian foreign minister, [Sergei] Lavrov. I have nothing to add to this,"" Peskov said. While this appears to cast doubt on Trump's comments, it also does not directly contradict it. A mission led by European NATO countries is not the same as an international contingent of peacekeepers from around the world that includes European forces. All sides have said talks are at an early stage, and Peskov may have been aiming for deliberate ambiguity. He may also have been saving this as something that can be presented later as a Russian concession, to be sold at the highest possible price. In any case, an idea that gained little traction when Macron first proposed it a year ago is now being discussed in earnest. Military Considerations Nicu Popescu, at the European Council on Foreign Relations, raises the distinction between a peacekeeping force and what has been called a ""reassurance force"" designed to fight if Ukraine is attacked again. ""The problem with traditional peacekeeping missions is that they are bound by UN decisions, meaning Russia could veto it or terminate the mission at any time,"" Popescu, who was Moldovan foreign minister from 2021 to 2024, told RFE last month. Jamie Shea, who served in various senior NATO roles before retiring in 2018, agrees and raises two further issues. ""Do we use NATO forces currently defending NATO borders in Central and Eastern Europe? Poland is opposed to this. And do we focus more on building up the Ukrainian Army as the main deterrent force and spend our money on this rather than on the European reassurance force (as Denmark is advocating)?"" he asked. We could learn more when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets with Trump in Washington on February 26. Starmer has said Britain would be willing to put boots on the ground in a mission with a U.S. ""backstop"" such as air power. ""Europeans will be mindful of the Bosnian fiasco of the early 1990s when the Europeans were on the ground and being criticized all the time by the Americans who were safely in the air,"" said Shea, who became prominent as NATO spokesman during the 1990s Balkan wars. Starmer's remarks on being willing to send troops grabbed headlines, but so did serious voices pointing out that Britain's military capabilities are limited. Chief among them was Richard Dannatt, the former head of the British Army, who said it was ""so run down"" it could not lead the mission. Britain's military has been largely focused on anti-terror and counterinsurgency operations since the September 11 attacks in the United States. It has been through cuts in the last decade and a parliamentary report in September 2024 titled Ukraine: A Wakeup Call said Britain was ""underprepared"" to counter the Russian threat. In July, Starmer himself said that Britain's armed forces were ""hollowed out."" Political Factors Europe's other military big-hitter is France. The French Army has greater numbers than the British but has also been stretched by years-long combat deployments across Africa. French experts have voiced doubts about its capacity for a higher-intensity conflict such as Ukraine. ""We only have six long-range rocket launchers left; we do not have any real means of combating drones,"" noted Leo Peria Peigne from the French Institute of International Relations in November. Sweden and the Netherlands indicated they could be willing to provide troops under certain conditions. But Poland, which has a large army, said it would not. Germany is currently going through a political transition following elections at the weekend. Both outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his likely successor, election winner Friedrich Merz, have been lukewarm on sending German troops. But neither has ruled it out, and there have been signals from within both men's parties that things may change. Once again, it's early days. Another key component from Europe could come from some Nordic and Baltic nations, which have been bullish in their support of Ukraine. Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden issued a joint statement on February 24 marking the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine promising large and ongoing military support. It did not mention sending troops, although Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen indicated she had an open mind on the matter. Political considerations also still weigh heavily. Polling in Western Europe has consistently shown low levels of support for sending troops to Ukraine. The risks of sending such a contingent even in a noncombat role would be enormous. Rules of engagement would have to be set covering how to respond if they're fired on by Russian forces, and the political fallout of casualties could be huge.",Kremlin Casts Doubt After Trump Says Putin OK With European Troops In Ukraine,Ray Furlong,RFE/RL,2025-02-25T08:43:11,2025-02-25T10:27:01,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.rferl.org/a/crimea-claims-secret-soviet-submarine--reactivated-russia-ukraine-base/33327280.html,"In a video posted on Telegram in early February, two floating barriers are shown at the entrance to the natural harbor at Balaklava in Russian-held Crimea. Pro-Ukrainian activists claim the barriers, which can close the harbor to marine drones, are the latest evidence that a long-mothballed submarine base, once known as Object 825 GTS, is being returned to service. ""The [Russian] occupiers are again using an old underground submarine base, which previously functioned as a museum, for military purposes,"" the Crimean Tatar guerilla group Atesh recently posted on Telegram. The group believes the anti-drone barriers indicate the submarine base is being used for military purposes since no other sensitive facilities currently exist in the bay. Balaklava harbor was demilitarized by Ukraine in 2008, then had extensive marina facilities for pleasure craft built beginning in 2016 while under Russian control. The Balaklava submarine base was completed in 1961 when Crimea was a key Soviet naval hub. Balaklava's unique landscape allowed Soviet planners to tunnel straight from the sea some 600 meters through a mountain bulky enough to protect people and vessels inside from a direct nuclear strike. The secret facility contained shelter for up to nine submarines and their crews, as well as a dry dock in which vessels could be repaired and chambers where nuclear weapons could be stored and prepared for deployment. Secrecy around the Soviet base led to Balaklava's harbor becoming a ""closed"" area in which only those with special permits were able to enter. During the Cold War, submarines slipped in and out of the underground base only under the cover of darkness. After the breakup of the Soviet Union the base came under Ukrainian control but was left unguarded. A visitor in 1994 recalled entering the once-secret site that appeared as if ""it had been abandoned as a result of some sudden catastrophe,"" adding, ""Chernobyl involuntarily comes to mind."" Much of the interior was stripped by thieves in the 1990s before Ukraine reopened the facility as a museum in 2003. After the annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia in 2014, the base came under Russian control but continued operation as a museum. Recent reports that the base is being returned to military use is only the latest such claim. In October 2022, the Ukrainian Army pointed to apparent construction taking place near an entrance to the submarine base as evidence it was being returned to military duties. The museum, however, appears to remain open to the public. John C.K. Daly, a defense expert for The Jamestown Foundation, told RFE that if the facility is currently being used by the Russian Navy it would be for ships rather than submarines. ""Given size constraints of the Black Sea Fleet's Kilo-class submarines (their beam is too broad for Balaklava's current configuration), its use at present before renovation would necessarily be for surface ships."" With Russian naval ports being targeted by Ukraine's rapidly evolving marine drones, it is possible Russian ships are being sheltered in sections of the base, including vessels previously berthed at the nearby Sevastopol Naval Base, which has repeatedly been hit by Ukrainian sea drones and missiles.

https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-united-states-germany-merz-duda-trump-soldiers-nato-troops-defense-ukraine-war-russia/,"Polish President Andrzej Duda said Tuesday that if Germany doesn't want American troops on its soil, Poland would be happy to take them. Duda was responding to remarks by Germany’s election winner Friedrich Merz, who said that U.S. President Donald Trump doesn't care about Europe and that the continent urgently needs to strengthen its own defenses. “If Germany does not want American troops, does not want partnership with the United States, we will very willingly accept partnership with the United States,” the Polish president said in an interview with Polsat News.  “I am interested in transferring all the cooperation that Germany has with the United States to Poland. Very willingly,” Duda added. The Polish president was also skeptical about Merz's other suggestion that Europe might have to find a replacement for NATO. “NATO without the United States? ... Everything is possible, but what's the point? If there is a security alliance without the United States, then its guarantees without the world's strongest power would simply be illusory,” Duda said.  “A reliable ally is, above all, the United States, which has repeatedly shown over the last hundred years that when they return to the game, they are able to interrupt any armed conflict, to end it. We saw this during World War I, we saw this during World War II, right here in Europe,” the president said.  Under the Polish political system, the government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk — a Duda opponent — takes the lead in foreign and military policy. Tusk is also strongly pro-American, but has been taking the lead in meetings of European leaders to figure out the continent's security policy in light of what is happening in the United States. Duda has reached out to Trump, traveling to the U.S. over the weekend to the conservative CPAC conference, where he met briefly with the U.S. president. In the interview, Duda said he's not afraid that Trump would “sell Ukraine"" — a reaction to the U.S. president's closer ties with Russia's Vladimir Putin and sharp denunciations of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump is also demanding a minerals deal with Ukraine to repay what he incorrectly says was $500 billion in U.S. aid for Kyiv.  “America has invested a huge amount of money in Ukraine,"" Duda said, adding: ""He has the right to expect that the U.S. will get something out of it. In this sense, Donald Trump is more concerned about Ukraine not being sold into Russian hands,” Duda says.","Poland is ready to host US troops if Germany doesn’t want them, president says",Csongor Körömi,POLITICO,2025-02-25T14:35:50,2025-02-25T14:37:58,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.dw.com/en/venezuela-iran-forge-anti-western-partnership-of-necessity/a-71735747,"In February, two planes operated by the Venezuelan airline Conviasa left the Mexican city of El Paso for Venezuela. On board were Venezuelan migrants, including members of the criminal gang Tren de Agua. These flights were the result of earlier talks between US special envoy Richard Grenell and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Following their meeting in Caracas, Grenell returned to the US with six imprisoned American citizens. This meeting highlights one aspect in particular: The US and Venezuela are once again talking to each other. In Iran, however, the situation is somewhat different. As of now, US President Donald Trump has not sent a representative to Tehran. Currently, contact with the Iranian government is mainly based on political pressure. In February, Trump signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum to restore maximum pressure on the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, denying Iran all paths to a nuclear weapon, and countering Iran's malign influence abroad. Accordingto the White House, Iran's terrorist network should be neutralized and Iran's aggressive development of missiles, as well as other asymmetric and conventional weapons capabilities, should be countered. Following the announcements, the Iranian Foreign Minister expressed his willingness to talk. ""It is not difficult to reach practical assurances that Iran will not have nuclear weapons, provided that objective guarantees are also provided that hostile measures against Iran — including economic pressures and sanctions — will be effectively terminated,"" Abbas Araghchi stated on X. The question now remains as to how the Trump government's decisive course towards Venezuela and Iran will affect the relationship between the two countries. Until now, they had fostered close political ties and collaborated closely on economic matters. Last November, the excellent connection between the two countries went so far that the government in Caracas offered asylum to the political leadership in Tehran in the event of a coup in Iran. It seems that these plans are well advanced: According to the Chilean newspaper La Tercera, members of the Iranian leadership have already acquired real estate in Venezuela. Both countries face high economic pressure, largely due to severe Western sanctions, particularly from the US, the European Union and several Western countries, including the UK and Canada. These sanctions are justified on the grounds of human and civil rights violations, in Venezuela as well as in Iran. Iran is also sanctioned because of its nuclear program. In addition, both countries are very isolated in their respective regions. ""Iran lacks an allied government in the Middle East, and relies on non-state actors such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shiite militias in Iran and the Houthi militia in Yemen,"" Sara Bazoobandi of the Institute for Security Policy at the University of Kiel told DW. ""However, since the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, their significance has dwindled massively,"" she added. ""The situation is similar in Venezuela,"" Sabine Kurtenbach, Interim President of the German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA) in Hamburg, told DW. ""In the end, the country only has backing in Latin America from Nicaragua, Cuba and parts of the opposition in Bolivia,"" she said. This is why cooperation between the two countries makes economic sense, Kurtenbach added. ""Both are interested in circumventing the sanctions as far as possible, or at least mitigating their effects,"" she said. Iran exports refined oil products to Venezuela, as Venezuelan crude oil often cannot be processed due to a lack of infrastructure. Iran also supports Venezuela in building refineries, infrastructure and industry. According to La Tercera, weapons such as drones also find their way from Iran to Venezuela. For its part, Venezuela supplies Iran with crude oil and petroleum products as well as agricultural products such as coffee, cocoa and tropical fruit. The government in Caracas also pays for Iran's technical services with Venezuelan gold. ""The basis of the close relationship between the two states is also their ideological affinity,"" says Ibero-Americanist Sabine Kurtenbach. ""Both states are linked by their ideology of the so-called 'anti-imperialist struggle' against the US,"" she added. ""In Iran, it started with the revolution in 1979, in Venezuela with the beginning of the presidency of Hugo Chávez in 1999,"" she stated. In Kurtenbach's view, this has prompted Venezuela to present itself as a pioneer of a multipolar world order. ""The Maduro government is aiming for a constellation in which the US has less global power and less influence as only in such a constellation can the Maduro government survive in the long term."" As a result, verbal attacks on the US are part of Maduro's ideological inventory. Iran shares a common world view not only with Venezuela, but also with China, Russia and North Korea. ""This is based on the decline of the current liberal order and the decline of the global power of the West, led by the US,"" Sara Bazoobandi said, adding that ""the rhetoric cultivated by the country's leadership reflects this."" In November 2020, shortly after the US presidential elections at the time Iran's religious and political leader Ali Khamenei said that ""no matter who comes to power in the US, their policy towards Iran is the same: Hostility, arrogance, hypocrisy. They are the true face of evil."" ""Accordingly, Iran shares Venezuela's ambitions"" Sara Bazoobandi told DW. ""These countries trust each other and their actual cooperation is based on trust,"" she said. And yet, it remains to be seen how the relationship between the two countries will develop in light of the Trump administration. ""Iran's strategic course is at a turning point,"" Sara Bazoobandi highlights. Trump wants Tehran to give up its nuclear ambitions. Otherwise, the risk of a military strike by Israel against the nuclear facility increases. ""If Iran accepts this condition, sanctions are likely to be eased, opening up more opportunities for Iran to reintegrate into the global economy,"" she said, adding that ""in this case, Venezuela might not be an attractive partner."" However, if Iran decides to reject the US condition and continue its nuclear program, countries like Venezuela could become more economically important for Iran, according to Bazoobandi. Sabine Kurzenbach takes a similar view. ""If the US were to cooperate with Venezuelan oil production in the future, that would certainly be interesting for the Maduro government,"" she said.

The trio includes ex-Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, ex-Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and ex-Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. There have been	appointed as ""facilitators"" of a new peace process by the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The EAC and the SADC said in a statement their goal is an ""immediate and unconditional ceasefire."" Numerous calls for a ceasefire have so far gone unheeded as	M23 rebels continue	to advance in the country's east near the border with Rwanda, meeting little resistance from the Congolese army. DR Congo government under threat as M23 rebels advance
<h2>Situation in eastern DR Congo 'acute'<>
<p>The Rwanda-backed M23 has in recent weeks seized two major cities in the region, giving the armed group a major foothold since taking up arms again in late 2021.<>
<p>According to UN experts, the M23 is supported by around 4,000 Rwandan soldiers.<>
<p>According to DR Congo Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka, more than 7,000 people have been killed in the region since January. The numbers could not be independently verified.<>
<p>""We are extremely worried about recent developments in Congo, we know the situation particularly in the east is acute,"" Khan told reporters upon his arrival in the capital Kinshasa.<>
<p>Khan added that all sides of arms conflicts ""must comply with international humanitarian law."" Khan is set to meet DRC President Felix Tshisekedi, government ministers, the UN Secretary General's country representative Bintou Keita, as well as victims of the conflict and civil society members.
<h2>UK to stop Rwanda aid<>
<p>As a result of the M23 offensive, the UK government said that it was suspending most direct bilateral aid to Rwanda.<>
<p>""Rwanda may have security concerns but it is unacceptable to resolve these militarily,"" a government spokesperson said, adding that the aid would be suspended ""until significant progress"" was made in reducing the fighting.<>
<p>""The UK calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, humanitarian access, respect for international humanitarian law, meaningful engagement with African-led peace processes and the withdrawal of all Rwanda Defense Forces from Congolese territory,"" the spokesman added.

<p>""We already see some of the makings of a regional war,"" he says, also based on Burundian soldiers taking part in the fighting.	<>
<p>Talking about the reasons for the conflict between M23 rebels — backed by Rwanda — and Congolese forces, Moncrief says they involve a range of issues, from the fact the eastern part of DR Congo is rich with minerals, as well as other geopolitical reasons.	<>

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0de4wpvlo,"A dramatic day of high stakes diplomacy at the United Nations has exposed growing cracks in the transatlantic alliance since President Donald Trump returned to the global stage and massively shifted US foreign policy. When Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, Europe had no stronger partner than the United States. But this week, in the halls of the General Assembly and at the Security Council, the US worked against its closest allies and sided with Russia, Belarus and North Korea to pass resolutions on the conflict in Ukraine. To mark the third anniversary of Moscow's invasion, Ukraine sought a symbolic General Assembly resolution that would require the 193-member body to reaffirm Kyiv's territorial integrity and call for Russia to withdraw its forces in line with the UN charter. That resolution did pass on Monday, but with less support than in past years. Many members abstained to avoid a tricky tension created by the US. Washington's diplomats had urged other countries to vote against the measure and to instead support their ""forward looking resolution"" that was only three short paragraphs. It took a neutral stance on the war, without blaming Russia, and called for a swift end with a lasting peace to follow. Washington not only introduced their measure in the General Assembly where every nation's vote is equal, but also in the more powerful Security Council. Resolutions there are legally binding - though sometimes hard to enforce - and there had never been council action on Ukraine because of Russia's veto power as a permanent member. The move caught Europe off guard. One European diplomat told the BBC that the US behaved like a bully and did not take into account their stance on their continent's security. Another who sits on the Security Council, Slovenia's ambassador Samuel Zbogar, told the BBC that Europe is struggling to adjust to the 180-degree change in the US position - and the speed at which Washington is moving. He said the European Union will need to do some reflecting at the body's council meeting next week. ""Leaders will have to develop a plan on how the EU can actively be involved in finding peace, rather than reacting to what others are doing. It's up to us now in Europe to come forward,"" he told the BBC. There were plenty of reactions in the halls of UN headquarters in New York, as European leaders worked to reconcile with the latest US position. The UK's ambassador, Dame Barbara Woodward, and French UN Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere attempted to have the Security Council vote postponed, arguing that council members needed more time to consider the text and negotiate. Interestingly, the Chinese were willing to give more time for discussions, but the US and Russia, who are usually on opposite sides of issues on the council, both were against postponement. European members of the council then tried to introduce amendments, as they had successfully done earlier in the General Assembly resolution which led to the US abstaining on its own resolution. In the Security Council, the US threatened to block the proposed amendments to name Russia as the aggressor, reaffirm Ukraine's borders and call for a just peace. They said that it detracted from what Washington was trying to achieve and pursued a war of words rather than an end to the conflict. In the end, the US didn't have to use its veto because Russia voted to block the amended language. The US's neutral resolution then ultimately passed, breaking through three years of Security Council paralysis on the topic of Ukraine because of Russia's veto power. Just months ago, it would have seemed unthinkable that the first resolution adopted regarding the conflict would be one with such limited language - let alone that a resolution like this would be proposed by the US, condoned by Russia and passed without the full support of Europe's five council members. But the US hailed the development, the first action by the council to call for an end to the war. Others were not so celebratory. Richard Gowan, UN Director of the Crisis Group, said after three years of deepening animosity between Russia and the US at the UN, the sight of the two powers coordinating to embarrass Europe was pretty stunning. He said while everyone expected President Trump to be disruptive at the UN, this went beyond most people's expectations. ""The US lobbying against the European-Ukrainian resolution was very crude. US officials were reportedly threatening to cut aid to non-compliant states. This has left a nasty taste among many UN members,"" Mr Gowan said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv4m4npnedo,"Syria's interim president has told a national dialogue conference that the country has a ""historic"" opportunity to rebuild after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. Ahmed al-Sharaa also stressed the need for armed groups to integrate into the military and for the state to have a monopoly on weapons, saying Syria's ""strength lies in its unity"". The 600 delegates have been asked to provide recommendations on transitional justice, the economy, the new constitution and other topics to guide a new transitional government. But there has been criticism that the process has been rushed, and the Kurdish-led militia alliance and autonomous administration which control north-eastern Syria were not invited. The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years with an iron fist, with Bashar becoming president in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez. In 2011, Bashar brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes. On 8 December, he fled to Russia after a rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept down from north-western Syria and entered Damascus in the space of only 12 days. Seven weeks later, Sharaa was named president for the ""transitional period"" by his fellow rebel commanders. They also announced the cancellation of the 2012 constitution, the dissolution of the parliament, army and security agencies, and the integration of all rebel groups into the new state institutions replacing them. Sharaa promised to hold a national dialogue conference to discuss Syria's future, which he said would be followed by a ""constitutional declaration"" to serve during the transition. ""Syria liberated itself on its own, and it suits it to build itself on its own,"" Sharaa said in a speech at the national dialogue conference in Damascus on Tuesday. ""What we are living today is an exceptional, historic and rare opportunity. We must take advantage of every moment of it to serve the interests of our people and our country."" The organising committee said six working groups would be formed to discuss a transitional justice system, the new constitution, reforming and building state institutions, personal freedoms, the role of civil society, and the country's future economic model. The groups would agree non-binding recommendations, which would be presented to the new transitional government set to take power on Saturday and help shape the constitutional declaration, according to the committee. Sharaa said a transitional justice body would soon be formed to ""restore people's rights"" and start holding to account those who committed crimes against Syrians during the civil war. He also reiterated that non-state armed groups had to disarm and hand over their territory. ""The unity of arms and their monopoly by the state is not a luxury but a duty and an obligation,"" he said. ""Syria is indivisible; it is a complete whole, and its strength lies in its unity."" The interim government's forces control Syria's biggest cities, but large parts of the country are still held by various armed groups. They include the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia alliance supported by the US, which controls most of the north-east and serves as the armed forces of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES). The SDF has so far refused to integrate its forces into the new Syrian army, although negotiations have been taking place in recent weeks. Organisers of the conference said the SDF and AANES had not been invited because of that refusal, and that Kurds would be represented in Damascus even if they were not. However, SDF spokesman Farhad Shami told AFP news agency that ""the exclusion of the SDF and large sections of Syrian society confirm that the conference serves to please the outside world and not to seek a better future"". Thirty-five parties in the AANES also criticised what they claimed was the ""token representation"" of Kurds and other minorities, saying such events were ""meaningless, worthless, and will not contribute to finding real solutions to the country's ongoing crisis"". Moutasem Sioufi of The Day After, an independent civil society group that is participating in the conference, told the BBC that it was important that all groups were involved. ""We need to have dialogue with all the Syrian groups, with all Syrian powers, especially those who have great influence on the ground. Without that Syria would face a very hard time maintaining itself together,"" he said. The outcomes of the conference will be closely watched by the international community, which has called for an inclusive political process that represents the country's many ethnic and religious communities. During the civil war, the US, the UK, and the European Union imposed a wide range of sanctions on Syria targeting Assad's government and its allies in response to atrocities committed during the civil war. They have lifted some of the sanctions that crippled the Syrian economy since Assad's fall, but made further steps dependent on Syria's new leaders keeping promises to respect minority rights and move towards democracy. On Monday, the EU announced that it was suspending sanctions on its energy, transport and banking sectors to facilitate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani welcomed that decision, but he criticised the international sanctions still in place in a speech to the national dialogue conference. ""These sanctions are illegitimate and are not based on any legal or moral foundations,"" he said. ""They are being used as a means of pressure on the will of the Syrian people."" HTS, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, is subject to separate sanctions because it continues to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK. The sectarian violence involving Islamist factions, security forces and Druze gunmen is another sign of the fragile security situation. The strikes were south of Damascus, where Syrian security forces say they are battling gunmen from the religious minority. Ghayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election. Restrictions are also being eased on the financial services and energy sectors to help investment. There are concerns around what democracy could look like and the role of Islam in the new regime.

https://apnews.com/article/chile-blackout-power-outage-south-america-failure-electricity-8224a4cbcfc98c4f17e7d1e3b00936b5,"SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Electricity providers across Chile scrambled to restore service Tuesday after a sweeping blackout plunged 90% of the country into darkness, stranding commuters, knocking cell service offline and paralyzing businesses and daily life. The scale of the power outage appeared to take authorities off guard. The government declared a state of emergency alongside a mandatory nighttime curfew that will last until 6 a.m. Wednesday. “Our first concern, and the reason for this announcement, is to ensure people’s safety,” Interior Minister Carolina Tohá said in announcing the exceptional measures. The ministry deployed thousands of soldiers across the country to help maintain order and enforce the curfew. Mobile phone services blinkered offline. The world’s largest copper mine suspended operations. People complained of water shortages as pumps running on electricity stopped working. Emergency generators helped hospitals and government offices continue operating. But the lights — and, on a hot summer night in the Southern Hemisphere, the air conditioning and fans that keep people cool — began to return in spurts seven hours after the electric failure first struck. Cheers rung out on the streets where lights flickered back on. At around 11 p.m., power was restored to around half of the 8 million affected households, said President Gabriel Boric. “What happened today is outrageous,” Boric said in a late-night televised address. “It’s unacceptable that one or several companies impact the everyday life of millions of Chileans.” The National Electrical Coordinator, Chile’s grid operator, said a disruption had occurred in a high-voltage backbone transmission line that carries power from the Atacama Desert of northern Chile to the capital of Santiago in the country’s central valley. The operator’s president, Juan Carlos Olmedo, said that the regional problem started a long-distance chain reaction of overloads and plant shutdowns until it became a giant blackout that hit 90% of Chile’s 19 million people, from the northernmost Chilean port of Arica to the southern Los Lagos agricultural region. “The electric system did not operate the way it should have,” he said. The specific cause of the failure remains under investigation. Officials have ruled out a cyberattack or any kind of criminal activity. All over Chile, traffic lights darkened, trains stopped and ATMs shut down. Soccer matches were called off, classes were canceled and concerts postponed. Police officers and civilians worked together to direct traffic. Petrol stations were left unable to pump. Businesses, from restaurants and bars to movie theaters, lost money. Frantic crowds became stranded in stalled subway cars. Older adults fretted they would not be able to leave apartment buildings because elevators were out of order. “Everything has stopped, there’s chaos,” said Jorge Calderón, a writer and resident of Santiago. Chile’s national disaster response service, Senapred, said the disruption in the power supply caused an outage across 14 of the country’s 16 regions, including Santiago, a city of some 8.4 million people, where authorities said there would be no subway service until further notice. Tohá said hospitals, prisons and government buildings were using backup generators to keep essential equipment operating. Officials evacuated passengers from darkened tunnels and subway stations in Santiago and elsewhere in the country, including the coastal tourist hotspot of Valparaiso. Videos on social media shared from across Chile, a long ribbon of a country stretching 4,300 kilometers (over 2,600 miles) along the southern Pacific coast, showed mass confusion at intersections as traffic lights failed, people having to use their mobile phones as torches in the underground metro and police dispatched to help evacuate buildings. Transport Minister Juan Carlos Muñoz urged people to stay home, saying it’s “not a good time to go out since we have a transport system that is not operating normally” with just a fraction of the traffic lights functioning nationwide. Authorities at Santiago International Airport said terminals had switched to emergency power but warned that “some flights could be impacted.” Some copper mines in the Andean nation shut down for lack of electricity while others used auxiliary power to continue operations. The world’s biggest copper producer, state-owned mining company Codelco, said the power outage had “affected all operations,” without elaborating. ___ Batschke reported from Sao Paulo.

https://www.latintimes.com/chapitos-leader-ivan-archivaldo-guzman-reportedly-managed-escape-ambush-through-tunnel-576600,"It has been a turbulent few days for residents of Culiacán as government officials and law enforcement agencies continue to look for Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, one of Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán's sons and the alleged leader of ""Los Chapitos,"" a faction of the Sinaloa Cartel. Secret operations in the state last week led to the arrest of four high-profile members of the criminal organization, including the security chief of Iván Archivaldo Guzmán and his financial operator. Among those arrested by members of the Mexican Army and the National Guard were José Ángel Canobbio Inzunza, alias ""El Güerito,"" Kevin Alonso Gil Acosta, a.k.a. ""El 200,"" José Alonso Acosta López ""El Gusi,"" and Gustavo Acosta López. Authorities detailed that ""El 200"" served as the security chief for Los Chapitos before his arrest, while El Güerito served as the financial mastermind behind the organization's fentanyl distribution. But according tolocal reports, operations were also meant to arrest Archivaldo Guzmán, who allegedly managed to escape via a tunnel, just like his father did during his second escape from a maximum security prison in 2015. According to the journalist José Luis Montenegro, who claims to have sources inside the Los Chapitos camp, Archivaldo Guzmán was at a home in the Tierra Blanca neighborhood when the operations took place. He detailed that the property counts with an underground tunnel, which Iván Archivaldo allegedly used to get away. ""According to my sources, he escaped just like his father did in order to avoid being captured,"" Montenegro said in an interview. He added that Archivaldo Guzmán was with Eric Bastidas, alias ""El 09,"" at the moment of his escape, a close confidant and ally of his. Although he managed to escape, reports suggest the leader of Los Chapitos suffered an injury. It was not confirmed if it was a gunshot wound as authorities did not report any violent clashes during the operations. Mexican authorities have not released any official information about the incident, but according to a report by the outletAdiscusión, the clandestine tunnel was found by members of Mexico's Attorney General's Office between Feb. 21 and Feb. 23. The tunnel reportedly has a length of more than 2,600 feet and connects the two properties through an exit built in the bathroom. While investigating the scene, authorities found shovels and buckets that were allegedly used for its construction as well as some ventilation devices, which facilitated air circulation throughout the slim tunnel. One of El Chapo's sons, Archivaldo Guzmán was born on August 15, 1983 in Culiacán, Sinaloa. Due to his prominent role in the cartel, the U.S. Department of State is offering a reward up to $10 million for information leading to his arrest. According to U.S. authorities, Archivaldo alongside his brother Jesús Alfredo and his half-brothers Ovidio and Joaquín Guzmán López formed the criminal group known as Los Chapitos, who is largely responsible for the massive influx of fentanyl into the U.S. over the past several years. All four brothers have been indicted across several judicial districts over the years for major violations of U.S. drug laws. © 2025 Latin Times. All rights reserved.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250225001155315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, Feb. 25 (Yonhap) -- Impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol said Tuesday he will focus on revising the Constitution if reinstated, suggesting he could step down before the end of his single, five-year term. Yoon made the remark in his final statement before the Constitutional Court, which is expected to deliver a ruling by mid-March on whether to uphold or dismiss his impeachment over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December. ""I will gather the will of the people and swiftly push for a constitutional amendment, doing my best to produce a Constitution and political structure that fit the changes in our society,"" he said during the final hearing of his impeachment trial at the court. ""If a constitutional amendment and political reform are pursued correctly, I believe the separated and divided people will unite in the process,"" he said. ""If that happens, there will be no reason to cling to the remainder of my term as guaranteed under the Constitution, and if anything, it will be a great honor,"" he added. South Korea's Constitution limits presidents to a single, five-year term, but Yoon's remark suggests he could accept calls to change the limit to two four-year terms and apply the rule to himself. Yoon also said he plans to focus on foreign relations based on his experience of strengthening the South Korea-U.S. alliance and establishing trilateral cooperation among South Korea, the United States and Japan, while shifting authority over domestic issues to the prime minister. In his 67-minute statement, Yoon repeatedly denied the charges of insurrection leveled at him over his surprise declaration of martial law Dec. 3, citing what he described as a small number of troops that entered the National Assembly compound that night and the short amount of time -- two hours -- they were deployed there. He also dismissed as ""absurd"" claims that he ordered the arrest of politicians or the removal of lawmakers from the National Assembly building. Still, he offered an apology to the nation for the ""confusion and inconvenience"" caused by his martial law bid. ""I want to first say that I am sorry and thankful to the people,"" he said. ""While feeling thankful, the reality of not being able to do my work in the time given to me by the people made me sorry and caused my heart to ache."" The National Assembly's impeachment motion against Yoon accuses the president of violating the Constitution and laws by declaring martial law in the absence of a national emergency and ignoring due procedures, such as holding a Cabinet meeting and notifying parliament. Yoon has argued his declaration of martial law was an act of governance meant to send a warning to the opposition party over its repeated impeachments of government officials and attempts to cut the government budget. Legal experts anticipate the court will deliver its verdict on whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate him within two weeks after Tuesday's hearing, citing the precedents of former Presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Park Geun-hye. If he is ousted, the country will be required to hold a snap presidential within 60 days. If reinstated, he will serve out the remainder of his term through May 2027. The court did not schedule a date for the verdict Tuesday. Earlier during the proceeding, the legal teams of both Yoon and the National Assembly, which is the prosecution in the case, delivered their final arguments. Yoon's team called for the dismissal of his impeachment, saying the opposition party's unilateral actions necessitated his short-lived imposition of martial law. ""The emergency martial law ended after two hours, and not a single citizen was injured in the process of declaring and lifting the decree,"" Chah Kee-whahn, one of the lawyers, said. Lee Dong-chan, another lawyer, said the opposition party's policy obstructions, railroading of legislation and unilateral cuts of the government budget were to blame for the president's action. ""It cannot be denied that the state created by the opposition party is a state of national emergency,"" he said. The National Assembly's legal team demanded the court uphold the impeachment and remove Yoon from office. ""It became clear through evidence examination during the impeachment trial and the related investigation that (Yoon) violated the Constitution and laws through a series of insurrection actions,"" Song Doo-hwan, one of the National Assembly's lawyers, said. ""It is hard to imagine a graver reason than the reasons of unconstitutionality and illegality in this case in the past or in the future,"" he said. Rep. Jung Chung-rai of the main opposition Democratic Party, the head of the Assembly's impeachment panel, also delivered his final statement before Yoon. ""President Yoon destroyed the Constitution and tried to violate the National Assembly,"" he said.

Authorities suspect theNortheast Cartel (CDN), a violent criminal group operating in northern Mexico, was responsible. Tamez García was reportedly driving a black Dodge Ram 1500 TRX to Monterrey to visit his family when he was abducted. He was allegedly intercepted on the Monterrey-Reynosa highway passing the San Juan Bridge–an area disputed by CDN and the Gulf Cartel. Tamez García was on a call with his family when armed men, allegedly posing as law enforcement, stopped him. Relatives alerted authorities after losing contact with him near a toll booth. His case is being widely discussed on social media, with some reports suggesting that his captors initially intended to steal his truck, and the situation escalated into a kidnapping. Leaked cartelaudio recordingscircling online suggest that a CDN leader, ""El Chamuko,"" ordered the abduction. Nuevo León authorities launched an operation, dismantling a cartel camp and engaging in armed clashes, with no success. As of Sunday evening, authorities have yet to locate Tamez García and his vehicle. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has designated the Northeast Cartel and five other Mexican cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, allowing for stronger sanctions and law enforcement actions. U.S. officials argue that these groups pose a national security threat, comparing them to al-Qaeda and ISIS. © 2025 Latin Times. All rights reserved.

Un tercer vuelo con 242 migrantes venezolanos, el primero con mujeres y niños, llegó a Caracas este lunes en un avión de la aerolínea estatal de Venezuela procedente de México, tras las conversaciones entre el gobierno de Nicolás Maduro y la administración del presidente Donald Trump. El ministro venezolano de Interior y Justicia, Diosdado Cabello, indicó que desconocen si el grupo fue enviado desde EEUU a territorio mexicano o si se encontraban ya allí. Precisó que está conformado por 94 hombres, 74 mujeres y 74 menores de edad, entre ellos una adolescente de 16 años sin acompañante. Cabello especificó que muchos de los menores llegaron sin ""ningún tipo de identificación"" venezolana porque nacieron en el exterior ""y no han sido registrados"" en el país, aseguró. Todos, agregó, serán sometidos a exámenes médicos y psicológicos. También recibirán los documentos de identidad que correspondan. El funcionario subrayó que todavía quedan muchos niños solos en el exterior y que sólo trajeron a una menor de edad sin representantes porque su padre aseguró que la buscaría en el aeropuerto. “Luego viene la revisión del expediente policial de cada uno de los adultos. Esto lo hacemos con una rigurosidad necesaria porque la primera información es que desde Estados Unidos venían delincuentes de todo tipo y cuando llegamos aquí la realidad no es esa, la realidad es que son una minoría”, dijo el ministro venezolano de Interior y Justicia antes de recibir a los recién llegados en el Aeropuerto Internacional Simón Bolívar. Cabello insistió en que ninguno de los venezolanos que han regresado tiene vínculos con la banda criminal Tren de Aragua, que el gobierno del país suramericano asegura haber desmantelado. De acuerdo con el ministro, es posible que esta semana llegue otro vuelo con repatriados. El 10 de febrero, fue trasladado a Venezuela un primer grupo de 190 migrantes irregulares venezolanos deportados desde Estados Unidos. El jueves de la semana pasada llegaron 177 migrantes venezolanos que estaban detenidos en la base naval de Guantánamo. En este caso, Cabello precisó que 8 de ellos están a la orden de la justicia por delitos “graves”, específicamente homicidio. Los vuelos de repatriación reiniciaron 10 días después de un encuentro en Caracas entre el gobernante Nicolás Maduro y Richard Grenell, enviado especial del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump. En esa reunión, según se anunció, Venezuela aceptó recibir a todos los inmigrantes irregulares venezolanos capturados en Estados Unidos.

https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-usmca-deal-tariff-deadline-monday-mananera-recap/,"United States President Donald Trump said Monday that his planned 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian exports to the U.S. “are going ahead on time, on schedule,” meaning the duties would take effect on March 4 at the conclusion of a one-month suspension. “This is an abuse that took place for many, many years,” Trump said in justification of the decision to impose tariffs on the United States’ neighbors and North American trade partners. “And I’m not even blaming the other countries that did this, I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen. I mean who can blame them if they made these great deals with the United States, took advantage of the United States on manufacturing, on just about everything,” he said at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. Earlier on Monday, President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed confidence that Mexico would in fact reach an agreement with the United States to stave off Trump’s proposed tariffs for a second time. At her morning press conference, Sheinbaum also spoke about the possibility of Mexico imposing additional tariffs on imports from countries with which it doesn’t have free trade agreements, most notably China. ‘If necessary,’ Sheinbaum will seek call with Trump Trump has said he plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for three reasons: On Monday, Sheinbaum reiterated Mexico’s commitment to “helping the United States” solve the “humanitarian crisis” caused by illicit fentanyl in the U.S. On actions to combat drug trafficking and other problems Mexico will need to reach “important agreements” with the United States this Friday, she said, noting that the tariffs are scheduled to take effect early next week. “If it is necessary I will be seeking another telephone call with President Trump — whatever is needed to reach an agreement,” Sheinbaum said. She noted that Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard traveled to Washington for tariff talks last week, and declared there is communication between Mexico and the United States “on all issues.” “What we need is to close this agreement” to ward off the tariffs,” said Sheinbaum, who earlier this month achieved a one-month pause on the proposed duties after agreeing to deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to Mexico’s northern border. “… I believe we’re in a position to do so,” she said. Ebrard has said that the United States would be shooting itself in the foot if it imposes a 25% tariff on Mexican exports, asserting that 400,000 jobs would be lost in the U.S. and prices would rise for U.S. consumers. He said earlier this month that 25% tariffs the United States intends to impose on all steel and aluminum imports are illogical and a “bad idea” with regard to Mexico, given that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Mexico on the trade of those metals. The steel and aluminum tariffs are scheduled to take effect on March 12. USMCA the priority, says Sheinbaum, and therefore additional tariffs on China are an option
Sheinbaum noted that an Economy Ministry team is still in Washington as Mexico seeks to reach a new deal to stop Trump’s proposed tariffs taking effect next week. “What we’ve established — I’ve said it from the beginning — is that the relationship and trade agreement with the United States has to be prioritized,” she said. “And we ask the United States to prioritize its trade agreement with Mexico and Canada,” Sheinbaum said. She said that imposing tariffs on imports from countries with which Mexico doesn’t have free trade agreements, such as China, is an option. “[Former] president López Obrador even did it, he put tariffs on countries with which we don’t have trade agreements,” said Sheinbaum, whose administration recently imposed tariffs on Chinese clothing and textiles. “… With China, for example, we don’t have a trade agreement. … So it’s part of what this [Economy Ministry] group is working on,” she said, alluding to additional tariffs on Chinese exports to Mexico. Bloomberg, citing “people familiar with the matter,” reported on Saturday that “the Trump administration told Mexican officials” including Minister Ebrard “that they should put their own duties on Chinese imports as part of their efforts to avoid tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.” However, Sheinbaum said that the implementation of tariffs on Chinese exports to Mexico wasn’t a “condition” that had been set by the United States. “The issue is to reach an agreement that allows us … to guarantee that there are no tariffs between our countries [and] that the trade agreement continues,” she said. “… [We have to] give priority to this trade agreement and see how the three [USMCA] countries can strengthen ourselves compared to other regions of the world,” Sheinbaum said. “… In that sense, we’re not suggesting [tariffs] in particular on China, but rather on those countries with which we don’t have trade agreements,” she said. “It’s something that I even put forward in the conversation I had with the president of China at the G20 [Summit in Brazil]. Of course with China there is a cultural relationship, … and [a relationship spanning] many other issues. On the issue of trade I told [President Xi Jinping] that we have the trade agreement with the United States and that is one of our priorities,” Sheinbaum said.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/morocco-says-it-foiled-major-islamic-state-plot/,"Moroccan authorities say they arrested a dozen people this month allegedly planning attacks on behalf of the Islamic State in the Sahel, a region south of the Sahara Desert. The discovery of the terrorist cell and what authorities called an “imminent dangerous terrorist plot” reflect the expanding ambitions of extremist groups in the region. Authorities do not provide details of the suspects’ motives or their plot, beyond saying they planned to set off bombs remotely. They release photographs and videos showing officers raiding terrorist cells throughout the country. The images show weapons stockpiles found during police raids, Islamic State flags drawn on walls, and thousands of dollars of cash. The revelation of the plot comes days after Morocco hosted Israeli Transportation Minister Miri Regev for a traffic safety conference. Regev cut her visit short last week after bombs exploded on empty buses near Tel Aviv Thursday. “Morocco remains a major target in the agenda of all terrorist organizations operating in the Sahel,” Habboub Cherkaoui, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations, says at a news conference. Authorities say the Morocco-based cell called itself “the Lions of the Caliphate in the Maghreb” and took direction from Islamic State in the Sahel commanders. The weapons found include materials to make explosives including nail bombs, dynamite and gas cylinders as well as knives, rifles and handguns whose serial numbers had been filed off. Investigators say the 12 men arrested ranged from 18 to 40 years old and were apprehended in nine different cities, including Casablanca, Fez and Tangier. The majority were unmarried and had not finished high school. They have not yet been charged under Morocco’s anti-terrorism laws.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/senior-hamas-official-i-wouldnt-have-backed-oct-7-if-id-known-outcome-for-gaza/,"Senior Hamas politburo member Moussa Abu Marzouk said he would not have backed the October 7, 2023, invasion and onslaught in southern Israel if he had known what the consequences would be for the Gaza Strip, in an interview with The New York Times that was conducted on Friday and published on Monday. The October 7 attack — in which thousands of Hamas-led terrorists burst across the Gaza-Israel border, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages, amid rampant acts of brutality and sexual assault — sparked the subsequent war in Gaza, which has devastated the enclave, seen tens of thousands killed, and prompted the US president to call for the forced relocation of the more than 2 million residents of the Strip. The war has also, through fighting on other fronts, significantly weakened Iran’s so-called “Axis of Resistance,” devastating the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon, and indirectly contributing to the collapse of the Iran-backed Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. “If it was expected that what happened would happen, there wouldn’t have been October 7,” Abu Marzouk said, asserting that — though he claimed to not have been privy to the exact details of the planned assault — he could not have brought himself to approve it, knowing what he knows now. The statement of regret marked a departure from previous statements by Hamas officials. A few weeks after the invasion, for example, politburo member Ghazi Hamad publicly declared that October 7 was “just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth,” saying, “we are ready to pay” the price, and vowing to continue until Israel was totally annihilated. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories In the weeks since a hostage release-ceasefire deal was reached last month, Hamas and its allies have also repeatedly called the war a “victory” for their cause.

(Abed Rahim Khatib) Indeed, Abu Marzouk’s remarks were quickly countered by Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem, who said: “The occupation’s aggressive and destructive behavior is the cause of the destruction in Gaza. The October 7 epic marks a strategic turning point in the Palestinian national struggle.” In a statement issued a short while later by the group itself, Hamas claimed Abu Marzouk’s comments were “incorrect and taken out of context.” “The interview was conducted a few days ago and the published statements did not reflect the full content of the answers,” the terror group contended. In the interview, Abu Marzouk said Hamas’s survival, despite Israel’s campaign in Gaza, constituted a “kind of victory.” He compared the terror group, which has been the de facto government of Gaza since ousting the Palestinian Authority’s main Fatah faction in a 2007 coup, to a regular person who has survived a boxing match with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. But he said that in absolute terms, it would be “unacceptable” to call the war a win for the terror group. “We’re talking about a party [Israel] that lost control of itself and took revenge against everything,” Abu Marzouk claimed. “That is not a victory under any circumstances.” Abu Marzouk says open to talking disarmament In the interview, Abu Marzouk also said he was open to discussing the potential disarmament of the terror group in Gaza, saying that, “We are ready to speak about every issue,” and, “Any issue that is put on the table, we need to speak about it.” He declined, however, to answer specific questions about what a compromise on disarmament might look like. The comments seemed to contradict more hardline statements from other public leaders of late, such as politburo member Osama Hamdan, who said this month that “the weapons of the resistance” were non-negotiable. Gazans, including young children, and Hamas gunmen, gather shortly before the release of three Israeli hostages in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip on February 22, 2025. (Eyad BABA / AFP) Asked about Hamdan’s remarks, Abu Marzouk told The New York Times that no one leader could set the organization’s agenda. Qassem, the Hamas spokesman, also rejected the idea of disarmament, saying: “We hold onto our resistance weapon as a legitimate right, and what was attributed to Moussa Abu Marzouk does not represent the movement’s stance. Resistance in all its forms is a legitimate right for our people until liberation and return.” Asked about the ongoing, fragile hostage release-ceasefire deal, which has paused fighting in the Strip as Hamas has freed captives who were mostly abducted on October 7 and Israel has set free over a thousand Palestinian security prisoners, including many terror convicts, Abu Marzouk said he was open to extending the three-part deal’s first phase, which is currently slated to end on Saturday. He said, however, that the group would demand far more security prisoners released in exchange for each of the remaining hostages than it had for those released in the past, noting that Hamas considers all the remaining living captives — including those who are in fact civilians — to be soldiers. Abu Marzouk suggested 500-to-1 and 1,000-to-1 as possible prisoner-to-hostage ratios for the remaining captives, which are likely to be rejected out of hand by Israel.

(AP Photo Alshrafi) The interview was conducted before Israel’s decision on Saturday to freeze the release of 602 security inmates in exchange for six living hostages, after five of those hostages were released in propaganda ceremonies that the state called “humiliations.” Abu Marzouk added that Hamas is also open to releasing all the hostages at once, in exchange for an end to the war and the release of all Palestinian prisoners — terms which Israel has rejected.

(Menahem KAHANA / AFP) US President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday that, “We will get to phase two… I think it’s going to happen,” but called any Hamas role in the postwar government of the Strip a “red line.” Israeli leaders have repeatedly stressed in recent days that there are battle plans ready in the event that the deal should collapse and fighting resume. On Monday, the Israel Defense Forces struck a rocket launching site in Gaza, from which a rocket had been fired at Israel but fell short in the Strip, the military said. It added that a second rocket launch site in the area was also targeted.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4lp2pw9pko,"The Taliban has told the BBC it will endeavour to release two British nationals who have been arrested and held in Afghanistan ""as soon as possible"". Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were arrested on 1 February while returning to their home in the country's Bamiyan province. An American national and an Afghan were also arrested alongside the couple, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Affairs said. The UK Foreign Office said on Monday it was supporting their family. In a statement, Taliban official Abdul Mateen Qani said: ""A series of considerations is being taken into account, and after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible."" All three foreign nationals had Afghan passports and national ID cards, he added. The reason for Mr and Mrs Reynolds's arrest has not been confirmed. The couple had been running training projects in Afghanistan for 18 years, including one that involved training mothers and children. Their work had apparently been approved by the local authorities, despite the Taliban banning education for girls over the age of 12 and not allowing women to work. The Taliban announced women would be banned from working for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in 2022. Last December, it said it would close any NGOs employing women. The pair married in Kabul in 1970. They remained in Afghanistan after the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, which saw most westerners leave the country. Their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, told the BBC she had not heard from her parents in more than two weeks. They had communicated by text after the pair were initially arrested, but contact stopped after three days. Ms Entwistle and her siblings wrote to the Taliban to plead for their parents' release. ""We recognise that there have been instances where exchanges have been beneficial for your government and western nations,"" they wrote. ""However, our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded."" On Monday, Ms Entwistle said they had wanted to give the Taliban an opportunity ""to explain their reasons,"" because Mr and Mrs Reynolds had ""always sought to honour"" the group. But she said they could no longer wait, telling Times Radio: ""We are now urgently calling on the British consulate to do everything in their power to get us answers and to put as much pressure as they can on the Taliban for their release"". The UK shut its embassy in Kabul and withdrew its diplomats from the country after the Taliban returned to power. The Foreign Office says support for British nationals in Afghanistan is therefore ""severely limited"" and advises against all travel to the country.

China’s Maritime Safety Administration said the exercises would be focused on the Beibu Gulf area, closer to the Chinese side of the Gulf of Tonkin, and would run through Thursday evening. It gave no further details, but the drills follow an announcement last week by Vietnam establishing a baseline used to calculate the width of its territorial waters in the Gulf of Tonkin. State-run Vietnam News reported that the baseline was in compliance with the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea and would provide “a robust legal basis for safeguarding and exercising Vietnam’s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction.” Vietnam has not publicly responded to the Chinese drills. China and Vietnam have long had a maritime agreement governing the Gulf of Tonkin, but have been locked in competing claims in the nearby South China Sea over the Spratly and Paracel Islands and maritime areas. China has been been growing aggressive in pursuing those claims, and in October assaulted 10 Vietnamese fishermen near the Paracel Islands, three of whom suffered broken limbs. Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. China claims almost the entire South China Sea as its own, though it has not publicly released exact coordinates of its claim other than a map with 10 dashed lines broadly demarcating what it calls its territory. In addition to Vietnam, China’s claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan, while Indonesia has also figured in violent confrontations with the Chinese coast guard and fishing fleets in the waters around the Natuna Islands. Tensions have been particularly high with the Philippines, with regular confrontations between the two countries. Most recently, a Chinese navy helicopter flew within 10 feet (3 meters) of a Philippine patrol plane last week over the South China Sea, near the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal off the northwestern Philippines. Leaders in Australia and New Zealand also said China should have given more warning before its navy conducted an unusual series of live-fire exercises in the seas between the two countries, forcing flights on Friday and Saturday to divert on short notice. Political leaders from both countries emphasized that China didn’t breach international law, but said they had only been given “a couple hours notice” rather than the usual 12 to 24 hours.",China holds live-fire exercises in Gulf of Tonkin after Vietnam marks its territorial claims,DAVID RISING,AP News,2025-02-24T05:56:38,2025-02-24T21:14:13,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250224000800315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, Feb. 24 (Yonhap) -- North Korea threatened Monday to take ""resolute"" action after a South Korea-led monitoring group implementing U.N. sanctions against the North over its nuclear and missile programs has launched official activities. The North's threat came as the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT), established by South Korea and 10 other countries in October, pledged to ensure the full implementation of U.N. sanctions against North Korea at the inaugural meeting of its steering committee last week. Calling the MSMT an ""illegal and criminal ghost group,"" the chief of the external policy office at North Korea's foreign ministry warned that hostile forces will have to ""pay a steep price"" for their attempt to block the exercising of North Korea's sovereign rights, according to the Korean Central News Agency. ""The DPRK will never thirst for a lifting of sanctions but will never overlook the provocations of the U.S. and its followers to encroach upon the legitimate sovereignty of the DPRK under the pretext of implementing sanctions and strongly counter them with resolute actions,"" the official said. DPRK stands for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ""Sanctions waiver through negotiations is not a matter of concern from long ago for the DPRK, which has no sanctions to be canceled and to be added, and it is not on the agenda of the DPRK,"" the official noted. With Seoul's initiative, the 11 countries, including the United States and Japan, established the MSMT last October to continue the sanctions monitoring against North Korea following the disbandment of the U.N. monitoring panel in April last year due to Russia's veto.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx2vwg8gq1o,"Indian authorities have banned two highly-addictive opioids in response to a BBC investigation which found they were fuelling a public health crisis in parts of West Africa. In a letter seen by the BBC from India's Drugs Controller General, Dr Rajeev Singh Raghuvanshi said permission to manufacture and export the drugs had been withdrawn BBC Eye found one pharmaceutical company, Aveo, had been illegally exporting a harmful mix of tapentadol and carisoprodol in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire. India's Food and Drug Administration said the company's factory in Mumbai had since been raided and its entire stock seized. The circular from Dr Raghuvanshi, dated to Friday, cited the BBC investigation in his decision to ban all combinations of tapentadol and carisoprodol, which was to be implemented with immediate effect. He said this also came after officials had looked into ""the potential of drug abuse and its harmful impact on population"". Tapentadol is a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant so addictive it is banned in Europe. Carisoprodol is approved for use in the US, but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia and hallucinations. The combination of the two drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world as they can cause breathing difficulties and seizures and an overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, has shipped millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. The BBC World Service also found packets of these pills with the Aveo logo for sale on the streets of Nigeria, and in Ivoirian towns and cities. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to the nation's National Bureau of Statistics. As part of the investigation, the BBC also sent an undercover operative - posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria - inside one of Aveo's factories in India, where they filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria ""who all love this product"". Sharma in response replies ""OK,"" before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can ""relax"" and agrees they can get ""high"". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: ""This is very harmful for the health,"" adding that ""nowadays, this is business"". Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals did not respond to a request for comment when the BBC's initial investigation was published. India's Food and Drug Administration said a sting operation saw Aveo's entire stock seized and further production halted in a statement on Friday. Further legal action will be taken against the company, it added. The agency said it was ""fully prepared"" to take action against anyone involved in ""illegal activities that tarnish the reputation of the country"". The FDA has been instructed to carry out further inspections to prevent the supply of the drugs, it said. It is unclear how they died - the police had referred to a possible kidnapping but now suggest an accident. The attack on a Catholic priest comes amid rising political tensions ahead of October's elections. He is accused of backing M23 rebels in the east but he has previously denied links to the group. The opposition legislator had just left parliament when he was attacked by gunmen on a motorcycle, police say.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0xnnwkppo,"Sir Keir Starmer has announced a further £200m investment in the Grangemouth site. The prime minister called the announcement an ""investment in Scotland's industrial future"" when he addressed Scottish Labour's conference in Glasgow. The money will go towards creating a new industrial purpose for the site. The oil refinery, owned by Petroineos, is set to close by the summer with the loss of more than 400 jobs. Scotland's first minister, John Swinney, announced £25m of new funding in a statement to Holyrood last week and called for the UK government to invest more in the site. Petroineos announced the refinery at the central Scotland facility would close and transition to become an import terminal after reporting massive losses last year. Redundancy letters were sent out to staff at the refinery earlier this month, with just 65 of 500 jobs expected to be retained. Approximately 2,000 people are directly employed at the site - 500 at the refinery, 450 on the Forties pipeline from the North Sea and a further 1,000 in the Ineos petrochemicals business. A £1.5m report into the feasibility of Grangemouth becoming a low-carbon energy hub, known as Project Willow, is due to be published by the end of the month. Addressing the party's Scottish conference, Sir Keir said oil and gas would be part of Scotland's future for decades to come to protect the country's energy security. But he said the UK had to be at the forefront of clean energy and that the Grangemouth site presented a ""huge opportunity for renewal"". He said the site could have a future in bioengineering, biofuels, or Hydrogen energy. He told the conference: ""We will grasp the opportunities at Grangemouth, work alongside partners to develop viable proposals, team up with business to get new industries off the ground. ""And to attract private investors into the partnership we need, we will allocate £200m from the National Wealth Fund, for investment in Grangemouth, investment in Scotland's industrial future. ""That is the difference a Labour government can make."" The PM added that working people had to be protected, and that every worker made redundant would get 18 months full pay. He said there would be a £10m skills and training offer backed by the UK government and any businesses within the Grangemouth Freeport area that takes on the refinery workers would get national insurance relief. Sir Keir said a £100m growth deal was already in place for the area, supported by both the Scottish and UK governments. The Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar told the BBC's Sunday Showthe investment would pave the way for a ""clean and secure energy future"". Sarwar previously admittedthere had been ""nowhere near enough progress"" on effortsto support workers. However, he said his party was ""determined to deliver a just transition"". He said: ""We werepromised the 'Saudi Arabia of renewables' by the SNP government, we were promised a transition by a previous Tory government that was going to be fair. ""But it has not felt fair when you looked at what is happening in Grangemouth and this is a demonstration that this UK Labour government and a Scottish Labour government too, post 2026, will be absolutely determined to deliver a genuine just transition."" He added: ""That means thousands more jobs, billions of pounds worth of inward investment and the clean energy future, and security that our country needs."" The £200m investment will come from the National Wealth Fund. The fund is publicly-owned and backed by the Treasury, and invests alongside the private sector in projects across the UK - primarily focusing on initiatives that support clean energy. The UK government said its aim was to direct ""tens of billions of pounds"" of private investment to decarbonise the British economy. An initial £5.8bn injection was earmarked for green projects including ""carbon capture, green hydrogen, ports, gigafactories and green steel,"" according to UK government documents. On Tuesday, Scotland's first minister said his government would commit £25m to establish a ""just transition"" fund for Grangemouth. This money would expedite any proposals which come from Project Willow, which is examining other industries which could exist on the site such as plastics recycling, hydrogen production and sustainable aviation fuel. John Swinney said the additional £25m would take the Scottish government's total investment for the site to £87m. He also urged the UK government to at least match the Scottish government's just transition fund. Reacting to Sunday's announcment, the first minister said the funding was a ""step in the right direction,"" but called for it to made available ""immediately"". ""I welcome this response from the prime minister to my call earlier this week for the UK government to provide its fair share of support for Grangemouth,"" he said. ""Everyone working at Grangemouth's refinery is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland's net zero future. ""We will continue to work constructively with the UK government to secure the site's future."" Unite is the sole union representing workers at the plant. It has led a campaign for the refinery to be transitioned into a production hub for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The union praised the funding but warned the ""devil would be in the detail"". General secretary Sharon Graham said the deal was ""welcome news"" but stressed it was only the start of securing the facility for future generations. She said: ""This needs to be the start not the end in delivering a real workers' transition for Grangemouth. ""It is essential that all stakeholders come together to put the meat on the bones and that this investment counts for jobs and our security. Clear timescales will be important as well as details on jobs."" Roz Foyer, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC), said securing the jobs and futures of the workforce ""must be the priority"". She added: ""This announcement cannot be dismissed lightly. However, this funding will only have a transformative impact if used correctly and is accompanied by even further investment from both governments."" Iain Hardie, of Petroineos, said: ""The prime minister's commitment to Project Willow is very welcome and reflects the quality of the work done in the initial phase of the project. ""We look forward to continuing to support both governments in the next phase as the project develops to bring together a collation of parties interested in the development of a new low-carbon future for Scotland's largest industrial cluster.""",PM announces £200m Grangemouth site support fund,James Delaney,BBC News,2025-02-23T07:38:16,2025-02-23T11:53:58,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-843394,"Israel assumes that Hamas will agree to release additional hostages as part of the current phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, two Israeli officials told The Jerusalem Post. Extending the first phase of the deal after its 42 days are up is being considered. An extension would involve the release of four male hostages – who are all fathers – and others who are critically wounded, in exchange for prolonging the ceasefire during Ramadan, according to an official. The holy month is expected to begin on Friday evening. The first phase of the deal expires on March 1, at which point Israel and Hamas would return to war. “Hamas, for now, wants the deal to continue,” the officials told the Post following a four-hour meeting on Saturday night. “It’s in their interests. They want more convoys and heavy equipment to enter Gaza, and they don’t want to be the side – at this point – that causes the deal to collapse.” US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday that the US expects the second phase to advance. Witkoff made the comment in a CNN interview when asked about Israel’s decision to postpone the release of Palestinian prisoners. “We have to get an extension of phase one,” he said. “I’ll be going to the region this week, probably Wednesday, to negotiate that.” In a later interview with CBS News, Witkoff said the second phase means ending the war and excluding Hamas from any future government. The agreement was already signed at the end of last May, he said. He added that everything is still under discussion. Witkoff said he would be in the Middle East for five days. He will travel to Qatar, Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. He also mentioned American hostage Edan Alexander in his interview with CBS, saying the US administration is in “frequent contact” with his family. He said he believes the Trump administration will succeed in releasing Alexander from captivity. Hostage deal Since the beginning of phase one, 29 Israeli hostages have been released, as well as an additional five Thai hostages. On Saturday night, the Prime Minister’s Office announced that Israel will postpone the release of Palestinian prisoners until more Israeli hostages are freed, citing Hamas’s repeated violations of the deal. Hamas on Sunday condemned Israel’s decision, saying its claim that the hostages’ handover ceremonies are “humiliating” was false and a pretext to evade Israel’s obligations under the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Hamas stated, “We will not engage in talks with Israel until it releases the 600 Palestinian terrorists from prison.”",Hamas likely to agree to release more hostages in phase one,"AMICHAI STEIN, REUTERS, JERUSALEM POST STAFF",The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-23T11:20:34,2025-02-23T17:28:00,gemini-2.0-flash

Israel launched a broad offensive on the northern West Bank on Jan. 21 — two days after the ceasefire that paused the war in Gaza took hold — and then expanded it to include other nearby areas. Israel says it is determined to stamp out militancy in the territory, but Palestinians view such raids as part of an effort to cement Israeli control over the territory, where 3 million Palestinians live under military rule. The raids have been deadly and caused destruction to urban areas and displaced tens of thousands.
Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he had instructed the military to prepare to remain in some of the West Bank's refugee camps, from where he said some 40,000 Palestinians had fled — a figure confirmed by the United Nations — leaving the areas “emptied of residents.” He said in a statement he had ordered the military to “prepare for an extended stay in the camps that were cleared for the coming year and to not allow the return of residents or for terror to grow again.""
The military said it was expanding the raid in the West Bank to other areas and, in a rare move, was sending tanks to Jenin, long a bastion of armed struggle against Israel.

Under interim peace agreements from the early 1990s, Israel maintains control over large parts of the West Bank while the Palestinian Authority administers other areas. Israel regularly sends troops into Palestinian zones but it typically withdraws them once forces complete their missions.
The UN says the current operation is the longest since the early 2000s when Israel regularly raided the West Bank in response to a deadly Palestinian uprising.
Violence has surged in the West Bank throughout the Israel-Hamas war. Israel has carried out repeated raids during that time, but with fighting in Gaza and in Lebanon on hold, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under pressure from his far-right governing partners to crack down on militancy in the West Bank.
More than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel says most of those were militants, but stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions as well as people not involved in confrontations have also been killed. In the most recent operation, a pregnant Palestinian woman was killed.
Jewish settlers have also carried out repeated rampages throughout Palestinian areas in the territory. There has also been a spike in Palestinian attacks emanating from the West Bank and late Thursday, blasts rocked three empty parked buses in Israel, what police are viewing as a suspected militant attack.
The raid’s intensification comes at a sensitive time, as the truce between Israel and Hamas holds yet remains tenuous. Israel said it was delaying the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners until it gets assurances that Hamas stops what Israel says are “humiliating” handovers of hostages being freed. The sides do not yet appear to have begun negotiations on extending the ceasefire and its collapse could lead to renewed fighting in war-torn Gaza.
Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and Palestinians want all three territories for their future independent state.

https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3299680/india-scrambles-secure-its-place-us-china-ai-race-post-deepseek?module=top_story&pgtype=homepage,"For decades, India’s IT powerhouses have churned out code and talent that fuelled the world’s technological revolution. But with artificial intelligence poised to upend the very foundation of software services, can the world’s largest outsourcing hub pivot to an AI-driven future before it’s too late? The challenge is urgent. Chinese start-up DeepSeek has emerged as a formidable competitor to Western tech dominance with its cost-effective, open-source AI models. Industry voices say India must now seize this moment to reimagine its technological ecosystem or risk being left in the United States and China’s wake. “While software services have long been the backbone of digital transformation, AI’s ability to automate complex processes, enhance decision-making and create new revenue streams, among a host of other benefits, is compelling forward-looking organisations to recalibrate their focus,” said Raj Kapoor, founder and chairman of India Blockchain Alliance. A recent International Monetary Fund report warned that nearly 40 per cent jobs worldwide could be affected by AI. Meanwhile, the global software-services market – in which India holds a commanding 44 per cent share, according to New Delhi – faces slowing growth, with an annual expansion rate projected at 11.9 per cent through 2028. By contrast, AI is set to grow at a staggering 37.3 per cent annually between 2024 and 2030, according to data cited by Kapoor. India’s leaders are aware of the stakes. Last March, the government launched the US$1.25 billion “IndiaAI Mission” to nurture start-ups and build infrastructure. A modest US$575,000 allocation in the latest federal budget is also aimed at establishing three AI education centres focused on research. And IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in January that India’s foundational AI model, customised for its diverse cultural and linguistic needs, could be ready within months.","India scrambles to secure its place in US-China AI race, post-DeepSeek",Biman Mukherji,South China Morning Post,2025-02-23T09:00:14,2025-02-23T09:00:14,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazils-oil-and-gas-sector-to-attract-over-120-billion-in-investments-by-2029/,"Brazil’s oil and gas industry is set for a major boost, with investments projected to surpass R$ 609 billion ($122 billion) between 2025 and 2029, according to data from the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP). These funds will largely focus on offshore production in Brazil’s Campos and Santos Basins, which will receive nearly 90% of the total investment. The Campos Basin will secure R$ 195.8 billion, or 32.2% of the total, while the Santos Basin will attract R$ 347 billion, representing 57.1%. These two basins are essential to Brazil’s energy output due to their pre-salt reserves, which rank among the most productive deepwater oil fields globally. Offshore operations dominate Brazil’s oil strategy, with R$ 587.7 billion (96.7%) allocated to maritime activities, leaving just R$ 20 billion (3.3%) for onshore fields. TheANPprojects that Brazil will produce 4.28 million barrels of oil and 221 million cubic meters of natural gas daily during this period. In 2025 alone, investments are expected to reach R$ 139.5 billion, with the Campos and Santos Basins accounting for an overwhelming 95.85% of this amount. Petrobras, Brazil’s state-controlled oil giant, plays a central role in this expansion. The company plans to invest $77 billion in exploration and production as part of its $111 billion business plan for 2025–2029. This includes revitalizing mature fields in the Campos Basin and deploying advanced technologies to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Petrobras aims to maintain its position as a low-cost producer while addressing environmental concerns through $16.3 billion in low-carbon initiatives. Brazil’s focus on offshore production reflects its strategic advantage in pre-salt reserves, where breakeven costs remain below $40 per barrel. As one of the world’s largest crude exporters—shipping an average of 1.6 million barrels daily—Brazil continues to play a critical role in global energy markets. Thisinvestmentsurge highlights Brazil’s dual approach: expanding fossil fuel production while investing in renewable energy and emissions reduction technologies. Oil remains a cornerstone of Brazil’s economy, contributing over $33 billion annually in trade surpluses, even as the country aligns with global sustainability trends.

https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-funeral-nasrallah-hashem-safieddine-5b698c1d403887135e35b20c4cb22413,"BEIRUT (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of people packed into a stadium in Beirut and nearby streets on Sunday for the funeral of Hezbollah’s former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Nasrallah died after Israel’s air force dropped more than 80 bombs on the militant group’s main operations room in a southern suburb of the Lebanese capital, dealing a major blow to the Iran-backed group and political party that he had transformed into a potent force in the Middle East. He was one of Hezbollah’s founders and led it for more than 30 years, enjoying wide influence among the so-called Iran-led “axis of resistance” that also included Iraqi, Yemeni and Palestinian factions. Nasrallah also became an icon in other parts of the Arab world after Hezbollah fought Israel to a draw in a brutal monthlong war in 2006, but the group’s image suffered after it intervened on the side of former President Bashar Assad in Syria’s civil war. Hezbollah called on its supporters to attend the funeral in large numbers in what appears to be a move to show that it remains powerful even after suffering significant setbacks in a 14-month war with Israel that left many of its senior political and military officials dead. A Lebanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, estimated the crowd size at 450,000. Others gave higher estimates. The pro-Hezbollah pan-Arab TV channel Al-Mayadeen reported a figure of 1.4 million. “This massive crowd confirms that Hezbollah is still the most popular party at the Lebanese level, and as a result, all the talk that Hezbollah is weak or degraded is out of place,” said Ali Fayyad, a lawmaker with the group’s political wing, who attended the funeral. Sahar al-Attar, a mourner who traveled from Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley for the funeral said, “We would have come even under bullets” to attend Nasrallah’s burial. Nasrallah shared the funeral with his cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later. Nasrallah was laid to rest Sunday in Beirut after the funeral procession, while Safieddine will be buried in his hometown in southern Lebanon. Both had temporarily been buried in secret locations. As the coffins were paraded before the huge crowd, men riding on the platforms with them tossed flowers. Some in the crowd threw clothing articles in the hope they would come in contact with the coffins, believing it would bless them. Outside of the stadium, giant screens were placed along the road leading to the airport, titling the funeral: “We are committed to the covenant.” Senior Hezbollah official Ali Daamoush told reporters Saturday that about 800 prominent figures from 65 countries would attend the funeral in addition to thousands of individuals and activists from around the world. Iranian parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi were among the officials who arrived at the Lebanese capital’s main sports stadium. Lebanon’s parliament speaker and representatives of the president and prime minister were also in attendance. The funeral also drew non-official participants from outside of Lebanon, including some from Western countries. Irish activist Tara O’Grady waved the flag of her country and said that she came to Beirut “to stand with the people of Lebanon and their resistance against the Zionist regime who are brutally continuing to bomb the south of Lebanon.” She likened Nasrallah to Irish early-20th century revolutionary Michael Collins. As O’Grady spoke with The Associated Press, four Israeli warplanes flew at low altitude over Beirut while Nasrallah’s coffin was paraded into the stadium. The crowd chanted: “Death to Israel” and “At your service, Nasrallah.” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that the fighter jets flying over the funeral “send a clear message: Whoever threatens to annihilate Israel and strike Israel — that will be his end.” Hours before and during the funeral, the Israeli military also launched a series of strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. Also on Sunday, the Israeli military released a video that said it shows the airstrike that killed Nasrallah and some of the group’s top military officials on Sept. 27, 2024. As part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that ended the war with Israel on Nov. 27, Hezbollah is not supposed to have an armed presence along the border with Israel. The group was dealt another blow with the fall of the Assad family’s five-decade rule in Syria in early December, which blocked a main route for the flow of weapons and money from Iran. Its rivals have been calling on it to lay down its weapons all over Lebanon and become a political faction. Nasrallah’s successor, Hezbollah’s current Secretary-General Naim Kassem, said in a televised speech played at the funeral that “the resistance is still present and strong in numbers and weapons, and the inevitable victory is coming.” He was not at the stadium. Kassem added that “Israel must withdraw from the areas it still occupies” in southern Lebanon, referring to five strategic border points where Israeli forces remain.",Nasrallah: Thousands attend the funeral of Hezbollah leader,"Bassem Mroue, Abby Sewell, Sally Abou Aljoud",AP News,2025-02-23T05:20:33,2025-02-22T20:34:31,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250222-sudan-recalls-ambassador-from-kenya-as-nairobi-hosts-meeting-with-rivals-rsf,"Sudan's military-led government has recalled its ambassador from Kenya, in protest at Nairobi's hosting of meetingsÂ
aimed at forming a rival Sudanese government backed by the Rapid Support Forces. Issued on:22 - 17:26 The Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced via the state-run Sudan News Agency (SUNA) that theSudaneseauthorities recalled their ambassador from Kenya on Thursday. The diplomatic row began when the Founding Alliance for SudanÂ
was created in the Kenyan capital on Tuesday. This coalition is built around General Hemedtiâ

s Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and aims to establish a parallel government to the one in Port Sudan, which is led by the Sudanese army. The move came despite Hemedti being under United States sanctions, as he and his soldiers are accused of committing genocide in Darfur. In Kenya, members of the political sphere and civil society have struggled to understand how Kenyan President William Ruto could have allowed such an event to take place inNairobi. Sudan war is world's 'worst humanitarian crisis', the African Union says Former vice-president Rigathi Gachagua posted on social media: ""We are welcoming warlords. We are making headlines for discovering a new way to embarrass the nation."" And lawyer and activist Willis Evans Otieno wrote: ""Kenya cannot afford to become a breeding ground for foreign insurgencies."" In a statement, Sudan's foreign ministry accused Ruto of adopting a ""disgraceful position by embracing and encouraging a conspiracy"" that it says violates Sudan's sovereignty. The ministry summoned its envoy ""for consultations in protest against Kenya hosting the meetings of the rebel militia and its allies in another hostile move against Sudan,"" SUNA reported on Thursday. The paramilitary RSF, which has been at war with the army in Sudan for nearly two years, said at the event in Nairobi this week that they would sign a founding charter that would lead to the formation of a ""peace and unity government"". A source close to the organisers of the RSF meeting told news agencies that the signing of the charter, originally planned for Tuesday, had been postponed until the weekend. The war between the army and the RSF broke out in April 2023 and has killed tens of thousands of people, and uprooted more than 12 million. It has torn the country in two, with the army in control of the north and east, while the RSF holds nearly all of the west and large areas of the south. In a series of offensives this year, the army has retaken parts of greater Khartoum as well as the Al Jazirah state to its south. The RSF's preparations to form a rival government in territories it controls come as it seeks to consolidate its hold on the Darfur region of western Sudan, where only the city of Al-Fashir and its environs are held by the army. A spokesman forUnited Nationschief Antonio Guterres warned on Wednesday that the move could ""increase the fragmentation of the country and risk making this crisis even worse"". On Thursday, the Arab League condemned ""any steps that would undermine the unity of Sudan or expose it to division or fragmentation"". Drone strike on Darfur hospital kills 30 as Sudan conflict persists The Kenyan foreign ministry defended its hosting of the RSF event, saying this was ""compatible with Kenya's role in peace negotiations"". The Sudanese military-led government responded by accusing President Ruto of acting on ""his commercial and personal interests with the militia's regional sponsors"" â

 alluding to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has been widely accused of arming the RSF, despite its repeated denials. Last month, Kenya and theUAEsigned an economic agreement, which Ruto's office hailed as ""a historic milestone"" and ""the first agreement of its kind"". In December 2024, theÂ
UAE became the largest backer of new business projects in Africa, raising concerns about human rights and environmental protection. The positioning of Kenya's officials continues to cause concern. Martin Mavenjina of theKenya Human Rights Commissionsaid: ""Nairobi has not only become a haven for persona non grata but also the capital of transnational oppression."" Kenya probes alleged police involvement in abduction of government critics The abduction of foreign political opponents appears to be on the rise in Kenya. In November,Uganda's opposition figure Kizza Besigye was kidnapped in Nairobi and reappeared a few days later before a military court in his home country. Otsieno Namwaya ofHuman Rights Watchquestioned the country's future standing on the regional and international stage, as he believes: ""The Kenyan government no longer respects any international law.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8yvg5359po,"Health officials in two US states are tracking measles outbreaks as cases rise to nearly 100 people. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported on Friday that it was aware of 90 cases diagnosed in the last month in the South Plains area, in the north-west part of the state. At least 77 of them were reported in children and teens under 17. In New Mexico, officials said nine people had become sick in Lea County, along the state's eastern border with Texas. Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly. The outbreaks come amid a rise in US anti-vaccine sentiment, including towards the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab that is typically given during childhood. Health officials in Texas say their figures are likely to be an underestimate, as some parents may not report infections or may not realise their child has the disease. ""It is troubling, because this was completely preventable,"" Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner. ""It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans,"" he added. Symptoms of the highly-infectious illness include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a rash. A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death. Survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Most US children receive two shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates - generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the vaccine. But vaccination rates have dropped in some communities in recent decades as a loose network of vaccine sceptics have, without evidence, questioned the safety and efficacy of the shots. Robert F Kennedy Jr, recently confirmed as US President Donald Trump's health secretary, has faced strong criticism for his ties to these groups. Most states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption - a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement. In Texas, federal data shows that the state achieved a 94.3% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2023-2024 school year, while New Mexico reached 95%. But a state survey of Texas schools found that rates of exemptions were ticking upwards for MMR and other required vaccines. In Gaines County, where 57 of the Texas cases were reported, exemptions have surged over the last decade. State data shows 17.62% of students had a conscientious exemption to at least one required vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, up from 7.45% in the 2013-2014 year. Neighbouring Terry County, home to 20 cases, saw exemption rates go from zero to 3.73% in the same time period. Texas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unclear. CBS reports that the area is home to a large Mennonite community, which typically have low vaccination rates due to the group's religious beliefs. Some officials are reluctant to intervene. ""We respect everyone's right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated,"" Albert Pilkington, CEO of the nearby Seminole Hospital District, told the Texas Standard. ""That's just what it means to be an American, right?"" US children have been vaccinated against measles since 1963. The jab was improved and combined with vaccines for the mumps and rubella viruses about a decade later, and is widely considered to be safe. Prior to the vaccine's introduction, around 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles each year and 400–500 people died. In 2024, the US reported 285 cases with 114 hospitalisations. Health officials in New Mexico are offering a free vaccine clinic this week in an effort to boost protection. Texas also directed residents to contact their doctors or visit a clinic to get vaccinated if they have not previously received a shot.",US measles outbreak leaves nearly 100 ill in Texas and New Mexico,Laura Blasey,BBC News,2025-02-22T19:24:18,2025-02-22T19:24:18,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250222001500315,"KYIV, Feb. 22 (Yonhap) -- A Ukrainian defense intelligence official has mentioned the possibility of sending North Korean soldiers captured during combat to South Korea, in the first such acknowledgment by Kyiv. Andriy Chernyak, the representative of defense intelligence of Ukraine, made the remark in an exclusive interview with Yonhap News Agency in Kyiv on Friday (local time) when asked about the two North Korean soldiers held in Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. ""Everything is possible,"" Chernyak said in the interview conducted in Ukrainian. ""Nowadays, we cooperate with the South Korean government very closely. We have tight connections with your defense intelligence and special forces. So we think that such a situation may happen."" One of the two North Korean soldiers expressed his intention to defect to the South in a recent interview with the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo. The South Korean government has since said it is willing to provide protection and support if the soldiers request to come to the South, treating them as South Korean citizens, as guaranteed under the country's Constitution. Chernyak, who works for the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, the military intelligence agency of the Ministry of Defense, said he cannot disclose the location where the North Korean prisoners are being held. ""But all their needs are covered, they have everything necessary and they are situated in a protected, safe place,"" he said. Chernyak said the 11,000 North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia are posing a ""real problem"" for not only Ukraine but also the Asia-Pacific region. Around 4,000 of them have already been killed or seriously wounded, he said, but some could return to the battlefield after recovering. ""In this way, the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is prolonging,"" Chernyak said. ""Why I say it's a danger not only for Ukraine is because if those soldiers are injured, they will come back home and they are those people who have studied in real war conditions. This knowledge includes UAV tactics and small infantry group tactics."" Chernyak added, ""Right now in the world, only the Ukrainian and Russian armies have such experience, and North Korea is getting it too."" When asked about reports that North Korean troops had disappeared from the front lines since mid-January, Chernyak dismissed them as untrue. ""Actually they didn't disappear,"" he said. ""They were just taken back â	 because of the huge losses. They were completed and returned back to the battlefield."" He also said by Ukraine's estimates, North Korea could send an additional 150,000 troops in support of Russia's invasion. ""In the beginning, the North Korean soldiers didn't understand what to do,"" Chernyak said. ""They had used the wrong tactics. That's why they had so many losses. But they learn very fast. And now they have become quite skillful and professional. They have no fear of death and fight bravely."" Russian soldiers, however, ""undervalue them and act like North Korean soldiers are lower class,"" he said. ""But honestly, we have to note their skills."" On the negotiations between the United States and Russia to end the war, Chernyak said Moscow will try to prove Ukraine's armed forces are unable to protect the country. ""Russia is trying to activate their efforts along the whole front line. Even though there are no active hostilities, they enhance their intelligence operations,"" he said. ""No doubt they are going to use that for influencing the negotiation process."" Chernyak added, ""We shouldn't undervalue the enemy ... But on the other hand we have seen that the Russian Army is not so scary as they wanted to show."" The official stressed Ukraine ""can still hold the front line and fight"" and Russians have paid ""a high cost with the great human resource losses."" hague@yna.co.kr(END)",(Yonhap Interview) Ukraine official says sending of N.K.

https://apnews.com/article/panama-boat-capsize-migrants-fdf203b07bd521e60a3e3d1336441edd,"PANAMA CITY (AP) — A boat carrying 19 migrants — part of a “reverse flow” of migrants who once hoped to reach the United States — capsized off the Caribbean coast of Panama on Saturday, claiming the life of an 8-year-old Venezuelan boy, border authorities said. The boat, full of mostly Venezuelans and Colombians, carried 21 people in total, including two Indigenous Panamanians in charge of maneuvering the vessel headed toward Colombia. Authorities say the accident happened because of choppy sea conditions, which discouraged two other boats from making the trip. Twenty people were rescued, Panamanian border police confirmed, adding they “are deeply sorry about the death of the minor.” A growing number of migrants who once hoped to reach the U.S. have begun a “reverse flow” back to their countries of origin due to a tightening of immigration policy under U.S. President Donald Trump. Many of those migrants waited for months, sometimes more than a year, to apply for formal asylum in the U.S. using the Biden-era CBP One app. Those hopes were washed away when Trump took office and immediately closed down the app. Panama has not shared figures on how many migrants in the “reverse flow” pass through the country per day, but in neighboring Costa Rica, an official told The Associated Press this week they were seeing between 50 and 75 new migrants traveling south daily. With few resources or ways to get home, many South American migrants have started to travel home to their Andean countries with the help of smugglers. They often use small, motorized boats that travel through the Guna Yala, an archipelago with hundreds of small islands in the Caribbean. The boats often make trips between nearby coastal communities in Colombia and Panama. One pair of migrants who spoke to AP said they wanted to take the marine route because it was safer than traveling through the perilous jungled trenches of the Darien Gap, which divides Panama and Colombia. Smugglers once raked in money when migration flows north were heavy more than a year ago, and continue to make a smaller profit on migrants traveling back. Panama’s National Coastal Service said in a statement that Saturday’s boat capsizing was due to heavy swells in the archipelago. Border police and villagers were carrying out search and rescue efforts. Meanwhile, dozens of other migrants were being transported on Saturday to Guna Yala to begin their return by sea.",8-year-old boy dies as boat carrying 'reverse flow' of migrants capsizes off Panama coast,,AP News,2025-02-22T22:06:42,2025-02-22T17:06:42,gemini-2.0-flash

The chief of the press office at North Korea's defense ministry issued a statement after Seoul and Washington staged combined air drills, involving at least one B-1B bomber, on Thursday for the first time since the launch of the Trump administration. ""The DPRK will counter the strategic threat of the U.S. and other enemies with strategic means and continue its responsible military activities to control and manage the unstable security environment on the Korean Peninsula with powerful deterrence,"" the official was quoted as saying by the Korean Central News Agency. DPRK stands for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. North Korea claimed that since the Trump administration took office last month, the U.S. has been intensifying its military provocations threatening the security of the North. North Korea's rapid and accelerating move to bolster its nuclear force is a ""realistic requirement for coping with the military threat from the U.S. and its satellite countries which are getting more rampant recently,"" the official argued. North Korea has long denounced a joint military exercise between South Korea and the U.S. as a rehearsal for invasion though the allies said such drills are defensive in nature.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-843234,"Six hostages were released from Hamas captivity Saturday, as Tal Shoham, Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert, and Eliya Cohen returned to Israel after 505 days, and Avera Mengistu and Hisham Al-Sayed returned after being held by Hamas since 2014 and 2015, respectively.  Mengistu and Shoham were released in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, while Shem Tov, Wenkert, and Cohen were released from the Nuseirat refugee camp shortly after. Al-Sayed was then released from captivity in Gaza City. This marks the first time in the deal that hostages were released in Nuseirat and in Rafah. Saturday's transfer was the seventh wave of releases in the hostage deal. Like in previous hostage releases, the Hamas terrorist organization set up a propaganda ceremony by setting up a stage in Rafah decorated with provoking images and captions. Saturday morning's caption read, ""The land distinguishes its people from the dual nationality figures.” Hamas terrorists were filmed standing in a line in the pouring rain, armed with long rifles, according to Ynet. Shoham was forced to make a speech on Hamas's makeshift stage before he and Mengistu were handed to the Red Cross. Shoham appeared pale and underweight, while Mengistu appeared relatively stable and retained a similar body weight to when he was kidnapped. Red Cross vehicles arrived in Rafah on Saturday morning to collect Mengitsu and Shoham, after which they were transferred to Israeli forces and then to the Re'im base in Israel, where they reunited with their families. Shoham was then taken to Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva for treatment, while Mengistu was treated at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. After the announcement that both safely crossed into Israeli territory, the Shoham family said, ""The Shoham, Korngold, and Haran families are moved to welcome Tal back to us. This is an unforgettable moment where all emotions are rapidly mixing together. Our Tal is with us."" ""We thank all the people of Israel who stood with us through all the long days of pain and suffering. During these days, we need privacy for Tal, Adi, and the children. At this crucial moment in our lives, our only request is to seize this window of opportunity to secure a deal that will bring fathers back to their children - children need their fathers - and return all hostages home: the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for eternal rest. There is a window of opportunity; we must not miss it."" The Mengistu family added, ""Our family has endured ten years and five months of unimaginable suffering. During this time, there have been continuous efforts to secure his return, with prayers and pleas, some silent, that remained unanswered until today. In these moments, we gather in anxious anticipation of the return of our beloved son, brother, and uncle Avera. We ask that these moments be respected and that we be granted the peace and rest we so desperately need."" The release ceremony in Nuseirat for Shem Tov, Wenkert, and Cohen happened not long after the one in Rafah. Wenkert notably lost a lot of weight. Shem Tov kissed one of the Hamas terrorists on the head while he was on stage. The three arrived at the reception point at Re'im base accompanied by IDF personnel. Hamas also added a third location, Gaza City, where they released Hisham al-Sayed. Hamas did not plan any ceremonial event for al-Sayed ""out of respect for his family and respect for Muslim Israelis,"" according to Gazan reports. Al-Sayed, like Mengitsu, has been held captive far prior to October 7, 2023, as the Bedouin-Israeli hostage was held in the Palestinian exclave for nearly a decade. In parallel with the release of the six hostages from Gaza, a Red Cross convoy arrived at the Kerem Shalom crossing to receive Palestinian security prisoners who were released in exchange from prisons in Israel, Walla reported. KAN reported that about 602 prisoners were to be released on Saturday, 445 of whom were arrested in Gaza during the war. Several senior Hamas leaders from the West Bank and several prisoners who were rearrested after being released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal were among the hundreds of Palestinian security prisoners set to be released on Saturday. They were all given shirts that said, ""I will pursue my enemies and catch them,"" according to KAN. Among those who were set to be released on Saturday were 41 prisoners rearrested after being freed in the Gilad Shalit deal, 50 who were supposed to be serving life sentences, and 60 who were sentenced to long prison terms, according to Army Radio. Hamas said on Saturday it was ready to move to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal and to carry out a comprehensive hostage-prisoner exchange to achieve a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal of Israeli troops.

https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-pneumonia-hospital-b211a400c4cedc1f419d932447cfc189,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis’ complex respiratory infection isn’t life-threatening but he’s not out of danger, his medical team said Friday, as the 88-year-old pontiff marked his first week in the hospital battling pneumonia in both lungs — along with bacterial, viral and fungal infections on top of his chronic bronchitis. Francis’ doctors delivered their first in-person update on the pope’s condition, saying he will remain at Rome’s Gemelli hospital at least through next week. The pope is receiving occasional supplements of oxygen when he needs it and is responding to the drug therapy that was strengthened after the multiple infections were diagnosed, they said. Gemelli hospital Dr. Sergio Alfieri and Francis’ personal physician, Dr. Luigi Carbone, said Francis remains in good spirits and humor. Alfieri said that when he entered Francis’ suite to greet him on Friday morning as “Holy Father,” the pope replied by referring to Alfieri as “Holy Son.” “To the question ‘is the pope out of danger?’ No, the pope is not out of danger,” Alfieri said. “If you then ask if in this moment the pope is in a life-threatening situation, the answer is also no.” “Just now he went from his room to the chapel to pray for 20 minutes,” he said. “This is the situation. He is the pope, but he is also a man.” Francis was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex respiratory infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs on top of chronic bronchitis. They prescribed “absolute rest.” Alfieri said the pope came down with a seasonal infection that has filled hospitals, but with a difference. “Other 88-year-old people generally stay at home and watch TV in a rocking chair. Do you know any other 88-year-olds who govern, let’s say, a state and is also the spiritual father of all Catholics in the world? He does not spare himself, because he is enormously generous, so he got tired,″ Alfieri said. Francis is a known workaholic and has admitted to being a not-terribly-compliant patient in the past. Alfieri said he had been a “great patient” since he was admitted, but turned the floor over to Carbone to respond to whether he was disciplined when home, at the Santa Marta hotel in the Vatican where he lives. “He loves the church, and so it’s clear he put the church first while we cared for him at Santa Marta,” Carbone replied. Carbone said that Francis was responding to the drug therapy that was “strengthened” after the pneumonia was diagnosed earlier this week. He is also fighting a multipronged infection caused by bacteria, virus and fungus in the respiratory tract. Doctors said there was no evidence the germs had entered his bloodstream, a condition known as sepsis that they said remains the biggest concern. Sepsis is a complication of an infection that can lead to organ failure and death. Francis is receiving supplemental oxygen when he needs it through a nasal cannula, a thin flexible tube that delivers oxygen through the nose, but otherwise is attached to no other machinery. The doctors said Francis’ chronic bronchitis had caused permanent damage to his airways, a condition known as bronchiectasis. The cortisone treatment he received in the hospital has raised his blood sugar levels, requiring treatment for diabetes. But Alfieri said he hoped the condition would be temporary. In the best scenario, the pope will return to his residence cured of the infections, but his chronic conditions will remain, Alfieri said. As his hospital stay drags on, some of Francis’ cardinals have begun responding to the obvious question that is circulating: whether Francis might resign if he becomes irreversibly sick and unable to carry on. Francis has said he would consider it, after Pope Benedict XVI “opened the door” to popes retiring, but has shown no signs of stepping down and in fact has asserted recently that the job of pope is for life. Francis confirmed in 2022 that, shortly after being elected pontiff, he wrote a resignation letter in case medical problems impeded him from carrying out his duties. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. But there is no indication Francis is in any way incapacitated or is even considering stepping aside. During his hospital stay, he has continued to work, including making bishop appointments. After a hospital stay in 2021, he bristled when he learned that some clergy were allegedly already preparing for a conclave to elect his successor. Francis had an acute case of pneumonia in 2023 and is prone to respiratory infections in winter. Doctors say pneumonia in such a fragile, older patient makes him particularly prone to complications, given the difficulty in being able to effectively expel fluid from his lungs. While his heart is strong, Francis isn’t a particularly healthy 88-year-old. He is overweight, is not physically active, uses a wheelchair because of bad knees and had part of one lung removed as a young man. Despite the seriousness of Francis’ illness, it appears there have been moments of levity. Alfieri said he bowed his head close to the pope to explain that the hospitalization would continue until he could safely return to his residence at the Vatican. “He asked if I wanted to say confession,″ the doctor said. “I said, ‘Holy Father, if I have to confess, your hospitalization will be much, much longer.’” ___ Barry reported from Milan.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/20/ai-economy-undersea-cables-international-data-infrastructure/,"The artificial intelligence-powered economy has a massive vulnerability: the ocean. The digital world is connected by subsea cables, a roughly 750,000-mile network that could circle the globe 30 times. Laid as deep as five miles below the surface, these cords make daily life—and the global marketplace—possible. While 80 percent of international trade by volume is transported on the sea’s surface, 95 percent of international data flows under it, including instant messages, an estimated $10 trillion in daily financial transactions, and countries’ national-security secrets. Meanwhile, power generated offshore, a growing share of global energy, is often transported via subsea cables. The artificial intelligence-powered economy has a massive vulnerability: the ocean. The digital world is connected by subsea cables, a roughly 750,000-mile network that could circle the globe 30 times. Laid as deep as five miles below the surface, these cords make daily life—and the global marketplace—possible. While 80 percent of international trade by volume is transported on the sea’s surface, 95 percent of international data flows under it, including instant messages, an estimated $10 trillion in daily financial transactions, and countries’ national-security secrets. Meanwhile, power generated offshore, a growing share of global energy, is often transported via subsea cables. These two elements—data and power—are the foundations of the AI economy. But the subsea cables through which they flow face escalating dangers, and multiple incidents in the past few months have highlighted those risks. In November, a Chinese vessel reportedly dragged its anchor along the Baltic seabed for more than 100 miles, severing data cables between Sweden and Lithuania as well as between Finland and Germany. NATO ships had to intervene. A month later, a Russian oil tanker believed to be part of Moscow’s “ghost fleet” cut a cable carrying power between Finland and Estonia, only to be seized by Finnish authorities. The German foreign minister called these incidents a “wake-up call” for Europe. NATO has since established a new mission in the Baltic to protect undersea infrastructure. But the challenge is global and persistent—in a sign of the heightened tempo of such incidents, another undersea cable—located to the north of Taiwan, which is connected to the outside digital world through just 15 cables—was damaged in early January, potentially by a Chinese ship. Shortly after, two cables to the Taiwan-governed Matsu Islands disconnected due to what Taiwan’s Digital Affairs Ministry called “natural deterioration,” though backup microwave communications were activated to keep the islands’ 14,000 residents online. In some cases, disruptions are accidental. Backup systems can often limit the negative effects, as they did during the most recent Matsu incident. However, whatever their causes, the consequences of the approximately 150 cable-breaking incidents a year can often be severe, and include internet shutdowns, espionage, and costly repairs and delays. In one dire incident in 2008, the severing of two Mediterranean cables shut down internet access in 14 countries, including 100 percent of connections in the Maldives, and 82 percent in India. What makes today’s risks even more vexing than they were then are questions of scale and significance. One-off cable cuts are relatively straightforward to fix. But if cables are damaged at particularly sensitive times or places, or on a wider geographic scale, then that task is much more challenging. Meanwhile, subsea cables are growing even more necessary to daily life as artificial intelligence increases demands for global data transmission, including through overseas data centers connected to the global cable networks. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being invested in AI infrastructure every year. But that infrastructure is often connected through one of the thinnest, and potentially most vulnerable, physical networks on the planet. The individual fiber optic strands that, combined, make up the subsea cables through which world’s information flows are often barely thicker than a human hair. And that delicate infrastructure predates the digital age. The first undersea cables made trans-Atlantic telegraph communication possible in the 1850s, and through the technological revolutions since, they’ve connected telephones, modern telecommunications devices, and now the global AI infrastructure. In recent decades, three main players, analogous to national champions, have dominated the global subsea cable market: SubCom in the United States, NEC Corporation in Japan, and Alcatel Submarine Networks in France. As of 2021, these three companies held a 87 percent global market share. However, in recent years, China has disrupted the subsea cable ecosystem. Huawei Marine Networks was founded in 2008, and it soon became the fastest-growing subsea cable provider and the fourth-largest in the industry. From 2018 to 2022, HMN Tech, as it was renamed in the intervening years, supplied 18 percent of new cables based on total length. The company’s success followed the playbook of many Chinese technology champions, with subsidies from the Chinese government allowing it to submit lower bids on projects than free-market competitors. The latest, and perhaps most consequential, market shift in the industry is happening now: the proliferation of artificial intelligence. As data has become the foundation for both the digital economy and the emerging AI industry over the past decade, hyperscalers—or large computing and cloud services providers such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon—have become major players in the subsea cable market. Most cables are now built by consortiums of hyperscaler and telecommunication companies. As technology companies build up their cloud and AI capabilities and construct more data centers globally, they also invest in more subsea cables. Today, Google is a part or sole owner of roughly 33 cables. Even in a stable international environment, it would be impossible to separate subsea cables from geopolitics. There are always risks of sabotage or espionage and the need to adapt to national and international standards-setting. Every international cable project needs government approvals along its routes. But in a more competitive—even combative—period in global affairs, the subsea cable market has become a more contested arena. In 2023, FP columnist Elizabeth Braw argued that we are “entering the era of the undersea Iron Curtain.” The public debut of ChatGPT in late 2022 and the proliferation of AI-enabled tools since have brought this 20th-century division into a new period in the history of technology. Because of the rise of AI, these cables are more important than they were even two years ago. The contest over subsea cables entails old tools of statecraft, such as deterrence and incentives, deployed in new domains. And in recent years, that contest has played out in every major geopolitical theater, affecting global consumers and many of the world’s leading companies. In Europe, a Chinese-flagged ship is suspected of having damaged a Baltic subsea cable in October 2023, a year before the Baltic Sea sabotage that triggered a NATO response a few weeks ago. In another incident earlier in 2023, another Chinese-flagged vessel reportedly damaged the cables connecting Taiwan with its aforementioned outlying Matsu Islands, leaving them without internet for weeks. And the warning signs flashed even brighter in 2024. Early last year in the Middle East, three cables in the Red Sea—where 90 percent of Europe-Asia communication flows—were damaged when the anchor of a commercial ship sunk by Houthi missiles dragged along the ocean floor. And U.S. officials told CNN last fall that Russia is developing a deep sea-focused military unit, a capability that could give Moscow new tools for aggression and gray-zone operations and attacks that fall short of war. The United States’ concern about subsea cables is growing and bipartisan. In 2019, worried about China’s civil-military fusion, espionage, and cyberthreats, the first Trump administration sanctioned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. The Trump era’s State Department’s multilateral Clean Network initiative included a “Clean Cable” pillar “to ensure undersea cables connecting [the U.S.] to the global internet are not subverted for intelligence gathering by the [People’s Republic of China] at hyper scale.” In 2024, under the Biden administration, the State Department built on those initiatives released the “New York Joint Statement on the Security and Resilience of Undersea Cables,” a set of principles endorsed by 30 countries at the United Nations General Assembly. The United States is also a member of the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience, announced in 2023. As world powers vie for regional influence and partnerships, subsea cable infrastructure contracts have become commercial contests for spheres of geopolitical influence. In 2021, HMN Tech was pushed out of a project linking three Pacific islands, including the Federated States of Micronesia, which has a defense agreement with the United States. The project was scrapped and later replaced by the East Micronesia Cable project, jointly funded by the United States, Australia, and Japan. Meanwhile, Vietnam—which has five aging subsea cables—is upgrading its infrastructure, creating a new opening for international ties. U.S. officials and telecommunications companies have held multiple meetings with Vietnamese officials to dissuade them from using geopolitically problematic companies, with officials reportedly pointing out that the choice of infrastructure providers could make Vietnam more or less attractive for international investment. For many countries, physical connections to Chinese cables are viewed as vulnerabilities. The United States government in 2020 set up Team Telecom, an interagency group tasked with safeguarding United States telecommunications infrastructure and preventing direct cable connections between the U.S. and mainland China or Hong Kong. Team Telecom recommended that the Federal Communications Commission block the Hong Kong segment of four planned subsea cable routes. The project owners of these cables, both hyperscalers, switched their termination points to the Philippines and Taiwan, rather than Hong Kong, at an estimated cost of tens of millions of dollars. The contest over subsea cables isn’t just playing out in foreign ministries—it’s also altering how companies are governed and how the world is wired. Due in part to U.S. pressure, Huawei divested from Huawei Marine Networks in 2020, when the company rebranded to HMN Tech. More significantly than a change in name or structure, other companies have been squeezed out of projects since then. The SeaMeWe-6 cable, now under construction, will connect more than a dozen countries across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe. HMN Tech was poised to win the contract in 2020 with a bid that was approximately one-third lower than competitors’, but the United States offered five foreign telecom companies training grants worth a total of $3.8 million if they selected SubCom instead, while warning consortium members of potential sanctions against HMN Tech. SubCom ultimately won the SeaMeWe-6 contract, and Chinese companies left the consortium, to be replaced by enterprises from Malaysia and Indonesia. The results of such commercial and diplomatic maneuvering are clear: Chinese companies are losing ground in international markets. There are now only three new cables with connections in Hong Kong scheduled for 2025, and none after. For comparison, Singapore, historically a smaller market competitor than Hong Kong, has 26 subsea cables landing at three landing sites, with plans to double the number of sites by 2033. Under the sea as well as over it, the world is becoming more divided. The geography of subsea connections mirrors geopolitical divides. Rather than transiting the contested South China Sea, for example, Western consortiums now often pursue less direct avenues, such as through the Java Sea. They cover a greater distance at greater cost, but with less geopolitical risk. Guam, Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore may stand to benefit from new routes, especially as they become greater data center hubs. Meanwhile, China has increased its push for new subsea cable projects to the global south and parts of the world that are tied to its Digital Silk Road initiative, where Western interests hold less sway. A world divided into blocs by digital infrastructure may be more resilient, but security doesn’t come without trade-offs. At $40,000 to $60,000 per kilometer, cables are expensive to lay, and once they’re set and connected to facilities like data centers, they cannot be easily ripped out and replaced. Delayed, canceled, or rerouted subsea cables add uncertainty, complicating market dynamics. Longer cables laid over less efficient routes also mean more latency, as data must travel greater distances. And while casual internet users may not recognize slower speeds, quick data transfer time is critical across many industries—even milliseconds matter when it comes to executing financial transactions, let alone in military applications. In the competition over subsea cables, countries can work to increase the security of their infrastructure, but it’s not clear what victory looks like. When it comes to AI, the United States has aimed to keep and develop what former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan described as “as large a lead as possible,” especially in advanced logic and memory chips, with chip export controls and other measures in place to impede competitors’ progress. But despite the differences in products made by each enterprise, Chinese companies and the Chinese government have largely achieved self-reliance in subsea cables, with capabilities comparable to Western alternatives. That means that export controls alone can’t ensure Western advantage. While Beijing’s access to international markets has been curtailed, China possesses the technology and capabilities across the stack to manufacture all components of subsea cables at home. China also has a history of pouring heavy subsidies into the cable industry, a trend that carries across other industries from solar power to electric vehicles, and that gives it asymmetric advantages that distort markets. As a result, despite pressure, HMN Tech remains competitive, can offer lower prices, and is planning to build its own $500 million Europe-Middle East-Asia cable, a rival to the SeaMeWe-6 cable. China also has a strong foothold in cable maintenance and repair, which are critical and complex components of the infrastructure’s life cycle. The cable maintenance industry divides the ocean into zones, with certain repair ships designated to cover each. As a result, U.S.-owned cables may rely on Chinese repair ships in certain places, which could make them vulnerable to spyware, whatever their ownership. In one concerning incident, a Chinese repair company that worked on cables owned by U.S. hyperscalers appeared to hide its vessels’ locations near Taiwan and Indonesia, according to shipping data reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. This unusual and unexplained behavior raised alarm about what the vessel was doing and where it was doing it. And repairs are even more complicated and costly in conflict zones, such as during the clashes in the Red Sea last year. Even in the absence of conflict, competing claims to vital sea lanes can distort the subsea cable market. While the United States has exerted pressure to push Chinese companies out of certain projects, China has gone further, delaying or blocking permits for cables with U.S. involvement, including in the South China Sea. The rising risks to subsea cable networks are connected to crises above the surface. The Iranian-backed Houthi attacks on international shipping have damaged undersea cables in the Red Sea. Taiwan’s subsea connections are potential targets in coercion campaigns against the island. And even if Western Europe isn’t yet directly engaged in a military conflict with Moscow, its infrastructure is under threat by an expansionist Russia—and NATO is responding to that very real threat. Rather than wait for something to happen, there are proactive strategies to protect subsea cables and deter bad actors. Enhanced coordination in monitoring and management of the seas can help. Such measures may include increased patrols as well as potentially boarding and inspecting suspicious vessels, particularly in shallow areas with significant concentrations of cables. This approach could deter attacks and improve attribution when they do occur. Meanwhile, AI itself may solve some of subsea cables’ greatest vulnerabilities. The Wall Street Journal reports that AI-enabled underwater systems such as drones are already being used to identify and combat threats, even at the bottom of the ocean. Where such forward defenses don’t succeed and cable repairs need to be made, especially in contested waters, partners can protect repair ships in the short term and prevent and eliminate threats as they arise. Increased redundancy in sensitive areas, combined with more ex-China repair capacity, including expanding their fleets of cable-laying ships, could decrease downtimes and build on Washington’s Cable Security Program, which authorized and subsidized U.S. repair ships. Meanwhile, streamlined permitting processes could speed up repairs and build-outs, which once took under 12 months, but can now last for more than three years because of a complex regulatory environment that requires engagement with multiple levels of government, often with uncertain and competing priorities. An improved regulatory environment can also speed up innovation, which may help build more resilient, diversified cable networks. In the next few years, alternatives to subsea cables—such as satellites and other space-based systems such as satellites in low-earth orbit—have shown promise, though they currently have less capacity than subsea cable networks and are still vulnerable to natural and humanmade disasters. Still, such options, bolstered by a growing private-sector space industry, may provide new data transmission options and backups in certain sectors. Indeed, a NATO-funded project launched in July 2024 aims to reroute more internet traffic to space, in case of infrastructure disruptions on Earth. And when the two subsea cables connecting Taiwan with the Matsu Islands were disconnected in January, the backup microwave systems were activated almost instantly. Still, such measures currently provide only limited bandwidth. That may suffice for a country’s sparsely populated outlying islands, but it would likely fall short in urban areas or when it comes to high-volume, low-latency data centers. There is no comprehensive backup for the world’s subsea cable networks. But the seabed, like the surface, is not as peaceful as it once was. A lesson of the 2020s so far has been that when deterrence—whether by denial, punishment, or entanglement—fails in one domain, it can soon collapse elsewhere. That’s also true beneath the waves.",The AI Economy’s Massive Vulnerability,Jared Cohen,Foreign Policy,2025-02-20T06:00:46,2025-02-20T16:37:08,gemini-2.0-flash

https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2025-02-21/canada-declares-mexican-drug-cartels-tren-de-aragua-ms-13-terrorist-entities/,"Toronto, Canada (EFE).- Canada announced the designation of seven Latin American criminal organizations as terrorist groups, five Mexican drug cartels, Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, and El Salvador’s MS-13. On Thursday, Canada’s Public Safety Minister David McGuinty made the announcement in Ottawa, a day after United States President Donald Trump’s administration added Tren de Aragua, MS-13, the Sinaloa, Jalisco Nueva Generación, Noroeste, Gulf, Nueva Familia Michoacana and Unidos cartels to its list of terrorist groups. Canada included the same cartels, except for the Noroeste cartel. In addition to the seven Latin American criminal organizations, Canada considers 86 groups to be terrorists, including Spain’s ETA, Peru’s Sendero Luminoso, the US Proud Boys, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Palestine’s Hamas, and the United Kingdom’s Aryan Strikeforce. On Thursday, Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum announced two constitutional reforms to protect the country from foreign interference in response to Trump’s decision to declare drug cartels terrorists. McGuinty said at a news conference that “transnational criminal organizations, including cartels, play a leading role in the production and distribution of fentanyl throughout Canada,” so the government had decided to declare them terrorist groups to give law enforcement “every resource available.” McGuinty denied it was an action coordinated with the US government. “Canada is a sovereign, independent country. The decision to include (criminal organizations) is sovereign and independent. The reason is to keep our communities safe,” the Canadian minister said. Listing the cartels as terrorist organizations will freeze the assets and property of these groups in Canada and prevent Canadian citizens or residents from doing business with them.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/polish-anti-corruption-chief-resigns-amid-pegasus-scandal/,"WARSAW - Polish PM Donald Tusk has accepted the resignation of Agnieszka Kwiatkowska-Gurdak, head of the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (CBA), as the investigation into the Pegasus surveillance case continues. According to the justice ministry, nearly 600 people were targeted in Poland with Pegasus spyware between 2017 and 2022 under the former ruling PiS (ECR) party. Parliament is investigating the matter. “Resignation accepted,” Tusk (PO, EPP) wrote on X on Thursday afternoon, without giving a name. Earlier media reports suggested that Tusk was waiting for urgent clarifications regarding Kwiatkowska-Gurdak's recent testimony before the parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. During the public part of Tuesday's hearing, the CBA chief argued that she could not disclose most of the information in that setting, citing operational secrecy and the confidentiality of ongoing criminal proceedings. Tusk subsequently lifted her gag order, but members of the investigative committee criticised Kwiatkowska-Gurdak for what they saw as an overly broad interpretation of her right to withhold information. They argued that she had unnecessarily limited the scope of her testimony while in possession of relevant details. The deputy head of the commission, Marcin Bosacki (PO, EPP), stated that the CBA chief could have said more and that she had “interpreted too broadly her right not to inform the commission about the knowledge she possesses.” Shortly after the hearing, Tusk requested an urgent annual report on the CBA from Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak, under whose ministry the CBA falls. The resignation was confirmed on X by the spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior. ""On February 20, 2025, the head of the CBA, Ms. Agnieszka Kwiatkowska-Gurdak, submitted her resignation from her position to the Prime Minister Donald Tusk [...]. The resignation was accepted,"" the spokesman wrote on X. He added that Kwiatkowska-Gurdak will be replaced by Tomasz Strzelczyk, who was previously her deputy. Tusk's acceptance of the CBA chief's resignation was met with criticism from the PiS, which accused the prime minister of punishing her for wanting to remain impartial. ""Is this a Prime Minister? To win applause from his own fanatics, he boasts on X that he forced the head of a service to resign - just because she refused to take part in the political circus that its participants call a 'committee,'"" PiS MP and party international secretary Radosław Fogiel replied to Tusk's post on X. Tusk's government has promised to address the Pegasus scandal – one of the controversies of the PiS government – and hold those responsible accountable after it replaced PiS in power in December 2023.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyew21yyjzo,"An Indian pharmaceutical company is manufacturing unlicensed, highly addictive opioids and exporting them illegally to West Africa where they are driving a major public health crisis in countries including Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire, a BBC Eye investigation has revealed. Aveo Pharmaceuticals, based in Mumbai, makes a range of pills that go under different brand names and are packaged to look like legitimate medicines. But all contain the same harmful mix of ingredients: tapentadol, a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant so addictive it's banned in Europe. This combination of drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world and can cause breathing difficulties and seizures. An overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular as street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. The BBC World Service found packets of them, branded with the Aveo logo, for sale on the streets of Ghanaian, Nigerian, and Ivoirian towns and cities. Having traced the drugs back to Aveo's factory in India, the BBC sent an undercover operative inside the factory, posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria. Using a hidden camera, the BBC filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria ""who all love this product"". Sharma doesn't flinch. ""OK,"" he replies, before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can ""relax"" and agrees they can get ""high"". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: ""This is very harmful for the health,"" adding ""nowadays, this is business."" It is a business that is damaging the health and destroying the potential of millions of young people across West Africa. In the city of Tamale, in northern Ghana, so many young people are taking illegal opioids that one of the city's chiefs, Alhassan Maham, has created a voluntary task force of about 100 local citizens whose mission is to raid drug dealers and take these pills off the streets. ""The drugs consume the sanity of those who abuse them,"" says Maham, ""like a fire burns when kerosene is poured on it."" One addict in Tamale put it even more simply. The drugs, he said, have ""wasted our lives"". The BBC team followed the task force as they jumped on to motorbikes and, following a tip off about a drug deal, launched a raid in one of Tamale's poorest neighbourhoods. On the way they passed a young man slumped in a stupor who, according to locals, had taken these drugs. When the dealer was caught, he was carrying a plastic bag filled with green pills labelled Tafrodol. The packets were stamped with the distinctive logo of Aveo Pharmaceuticals. It's not just in Tamale that Aveo's pills are causing misery. The BBC found similar products, made by Aveo, have been seized by police elsewhere in Ghana. We also found evidence that Aveo's pills are for sale on the streets of Nigeria and Cote D'Ivoire, where teenagers dissolve them in an alcoholic energy drink to increase the high. Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, is shipping millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics. The Chairman of Nigeria's Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa, told the BBC, opioids are ""devastating our youths, our families, it's in every community in Nigeria"". In 2018, following a BBC Africa Eye investigation into the sale of opioids as street drugs, Nigerian authorities tried to get a grip on a widely abused opioid painkiller called tramadol. The government banned the sale of tramadol without prescription, imposed strict limits on the maximum dose, and cracked down on imports of illegal pills. At the same time, Indian authorities tightened export regulations on tramadol. Not long after this crackdown, Aveo Pharmaceuticals began to export a new pill based on tapentadol, an even stronger opioid, mixed with the muscle-relaxant carisoprodol. West African officials are warning that opioid exporters appear to be using these new combination pills as a substitute for tramadol and to evade the crackdown. In the Aveo factory there were cartons of the combination drugs stacked on top of each other, almost ceiling-high. On his desk, Vinod Sharma laid out packet after packet of the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail pills that the company markets under a range of names including Tafrodol, the most popular, as well as TimaKing and Super Royal-225. He told the BBC's undercover team that ""scientists"" working in his factory could combine different drugs to ""make a new product"". People outside the UK canwatch the documentary on YouTube. Aveo's new product is even more dangerous than the tramadol it has replaced. According to Dr Lekhansh Shukla, assistant professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bengaluru, India, tapentadol ""gives the effects of an opioid"" including very deep sleep. ""It could be deep enough that people don't breathe, and that leads to drug overdose,"" he explained. ""And along with that, you are giving another agent, carisoprodol, which also gives very deep sleep, relaxation. It sounds like a very dangerous combination."" Carisoprodol has been banned in Europe because it is addictive. It is approved for use in the US but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, and hallucinations. When mixed with tapentadol the withdrawal is even ""more severe"" compared to regular opioids, said Dr Shukla. ""It's a fairly painful experience."" He said he knew of no clinical trials on the efficacy of this combination. Unlike tramadol, which is legal for use in limited doses, the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail ""does not sound like a rational combination"", he said. ""This is not something that is licensed to be used in our country."" In India, pharmaceutical companies cannot legally manufacture and export unlicensed drugs unless these drugs meet the standards of the importing country. Aveo ships Tafrodol and similar products to Ghana, where this combination of tapentadol and carisoprodol is, according to Ghana's national Drug Enforcement Agency, unlicensed and illegal. By shipping Tafrodol to Ghana, Aveo is breaking Indian law. We put these allegations to Vinod Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals. They did not respond. The Indian drugs regulator, the CDSCO, told us the Indian government recognises its responsibility towards global public health and is committed to ensuring India has a responsible and strong pharmaceutical regulatory system. It added that exports from India to other countries are closely monitored and that recently tightened regulation is strictly enforced. It also called importing countries to support India's efforts by ensuring they had similarly strong regulatory systems. The CDSCO stated it has taken up the matter with other countries, including those in West Africa, and is committed to working with them to prevent wrongdoing. The regulator said it will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice. Aveo is not the only Indian company making and exporting unlicensed opioids. Publicly available export data suggest other pharma companies manufacture similar products, and drugs with different branding are widely available across West Africa. These manufacturers are damaging the reputation of India's fast-growing pharmaceutical industry, which makes high-quality generic medicines upon which millions of people worldwide depend and manufactures vaccines which have saved millions of lives. The industry's exports are worth at least $28bn (Â£22bn) a year. Speaking about his meeting with Sharma, the BBC's undercover operative, whose identity must remain concealed for his safety, says: ""Nigerian journalists have been reporting on this opioid crisis for more than 20 years but finally, I was face to face… with one of the men at the root of Africa's opioid crisis, one of the men who actually makes this product and ships it into our countries by the container load. He knew the harm it was doing but he didn't seem to care… describing it simply as business."" Back in Tamale, Ghana, the BBC team followed the local task force on one final raid that turned up even more of Aveo's Tafrodol. That evening they gathered in a local park to burn the drugs they had seized. ""We are burning it in an open glare for everybody to see,"" said Zickay, one of the leaders, as the packets were doused in petrol and set ablaze, ""so it sends a signal to the sellers and the suppliers: if they get you, they'll burn your drugs"". But even as the flames destroyed a few hundred packets of Tafrodol, the ""sellers and suppliers"" at the top of this chain, thousands of miles away in India, were churning out millions more - and getting rich on the profits of misery.",BBC undercover filming exposes Indian pharma firm fuelling opioid crisis,BBC Eye Investigations,BBC News,2025-02-20T19:53:54,2025-02-20T19:53:54,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/02/21/2003832237,"Democratic nations must band together to counter consolidating authoritarian powers and build “non-red” supply chains, President William Lai (賴清德) said at the opening of the two-day Halifax International Security Forum (HFX) yesterday. Taiwan occupies a critical position in the first island chain, safeguarding national sovereignty, maintaining a democratic way of life, and defending peace and security in the Taiwan Strait while facing authoritarian threats directly, Lai said at the event, which is being held in Taipei for the first time. Taiwan will uphold “peace through strength,” he added. As a responsible member of the international community, Taiwan will not provoke conflicts and will maintain the “status quo” in the Taiwan Strait, while being willing to engage in dialogue with China under the principles of equality and dignity, he said. The government has proposed increasing defense spending to more than 3 percent of GDP and established the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee last year, which is to pursue global peace by deepening relations with democratic allies and improving their defense resilience, he said. Technological strength, being the backbone of national defense, is key to deterring the expansion of authoritarianism, while it is also crucial to improve economic resilience by boosting industrial development, he said. As a country with a leading position in the semiconductor industry, Taiwan is willing to work with democratic allies to build a “non-red supply chain” to pursue mutual economic benefits and maintain global peace, he said. HFX president Peter van Praagh said that the forum being held in Taipei demonstrated the support of the international community for Taiwan. “Taiwan is a vital democracy whose continued freedom and security is important not only to the people of Taiwan, but to the security of the entire world,” Van Praagh told a news conference before the event. It is the first time that the forum is being held outside North America since it was launched in 2009 and it is not a coincidence that it is held in Taiwan, which is a vibrant democratic country facing potential aggression from its neighbor using “gray zone” tactics, Van Praagh said. The aim of the forum is to explore how international society should cope with the situation and most importantly what Taiwan can do, he said. “Through HFX Taipei, I wanted to bring democracies to Taipei to see and understand why Taiwan deserves the international community’s friendship and support,” Van Praagh added. He thanked United Microelectronics Corp (聯電) founder Robert Tsao (曹興誠), who also gave a speech, for his support. Asked how US President Donald Trump’s stance toward the Ukraine war could affect Taiwan, Tsao said that Taiwan could unite and demonstrate its determination to safeguard democracy, despite not being able to predict what Trump would do. The US will not help a country where 60 percent of its people support unification, so Taiwan should “help itself before expecting help from others,” Tsao said. The international society views Taiwan as a whole, despite its internal differences, he said, adding that no political struggle should sacrifice Taiwan’s sovereignty and international status. In his speech, Tsao thanked the forum for excluding China’s participation and not bowing to its pressure by including Taiwan. The event features on-and-off-the-record speeches by former government officials and academics from more than 70 countries, including former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and Akie Abe, former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe’s widow, on issues concerning democracy, security, resilience and partnership, the organizers said.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250220007852315?section=national/politics,"(ATTN: UPDATES throughout with details; RESTORES previous material; CHANGES headline)By Lee Haye-ah and Yi Wonju SEOUL, Feb. 20 (Yonhap) -- The final hearing of President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment trial will be held next week, the Constitutional Court said Thursday, increasing the likelihood a verdict will be delivered in mid-March. The hearing has been set for 2 p.m. Tuesday, and the legal teams of the National Assembly and Yoon will each be asked to present their closing arguments, while the parliament and the president will each be asked to give their final statements, acting court President Moon Hyung-bae said during the 10th hearing. The date of the final hearing increases the chances of a verdict in mid-March, as former Presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Park Geun-hye received their impeachment rulings about two weeks after their final hearings. The court will decide whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate him following his impeachment by the National Assembly over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December. Yoon has been accused of violating the Constitution and laws by declaring martial law without valid grounds. The president has countered that his action was a legitimate act of governance meant to send a warning to opposition parties over what he described as their abuse of legislative power. Yoon's lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, relayed a message from the president at a rally of his supporters in central Seoul. ""I will quickly return to duty and lead the Republic of Korea with the power of intergenerational unity,"" he was quoted as saying. If Yoon is ousted, the country will be required to hold a snap presidential election within 60 days. At Thursday's hearing, the court heard testimony from three witnesses -- impeached Prime Minister Han Duck-soo; Hong Jang-won, former first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service; and Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the National Police Agency. Han said he and other Cabinet members were concerned about Yoon's martial law plan and attempted to dissuade him before he announced it on Dec. 3. ""As I recall, all (Cabinet members) were concerned and tried to dissuade him,"" Han said, referring to a hastily arranged meeting of some Cabinet ministers shortly before Yoon's surprise imposition of martial law. When asked about former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun's testimony that some members were in favor of Yoon's plan, Han replied, ""From what I recall, that was not the case at all."" Hong, the former intelligence official, was grilled by Yoon's lawyers about the credibility of a memo he claims to have taken during a phone call with a military commander on the night of Dec. 3 to list the politicians and others the president allegedly wanted arrested. Cho, the police chief, declined to answer most questions, citing his own criminal trial on insurrection charges related to the martial law bid.(END)",(2nd LD) Final hearing of Yoon's impeachment trial to be held next week; verdict likely in mid-March,"Lee Haye-ah, Yi Wonju",Yonhap News Agency,2025-02-20T22:19:34,2025-02-20T22:19:34,gemini-2.0-flash

However, the third body at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute was not that of their mother, Shiri Bibas, says the Israel Defense Forces. Specialists at Abu Kabir were not able to identify the body. It did not match any male or female hostage, the IDF said. “This is an anonymous, identified body.” The authorities, using forensic evidence and intelligence, assess that the two young boys were ‘”brutally murdered” by terrorists in November 2023, says the IDF. Ariel was 4-years-old and Kfir was 10-months-old when they were murdered. “This is a very serious violation by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is required by the agreement to return four dead hostages,” says the IDF. “We demand that Hamas return Shiri home, along with all of our hostages.” “We share the deep sorrow of the Bibas family at this difficult time and will continue to make every effort to return Shiri and all the hostages home as soon as possible,” says the IDF.","IDF: Remains of Kfir and Ariel Bibas identified, but 3rd body sent by Hamas is not their mother Shiri",Lazar Berman,The Times of Israel,2025-02-20T23:20:45,2025-02-20T23:20:45,gemini-2.0-flash
