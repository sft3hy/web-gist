https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-iaea-zarif-tehran-c3a8afc699c670300b9521f1e2019ef7,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran confirmed Wednesday that the next round of nuclear talks with the United States this weekend will be held in Rome after earlier confusion over where the negotiations would be held. The announcement by Iranian state television came as Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian formally approved the resignation of one of his vice presidents who served as Tehran’s key negotiator in its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency, also arrived in the Islamic Republic on Wednesday. His talks may include negotiations over just what access the IAEA inspectors can get under any proposed deal. The state TV announcement said Oman will again mediate the talks on Saturday in Rome. Oman’s foreign minister served as an interlocutor between the two sides at talks last weekend in Muscat, the sultanate’s capital. Officials initially on Monday identified Rome as hosting the negotiations, only for Iran to insist early Tuesday they would return to Oman. American officials so far haven’t said publicly where the talks will be held, though Trump did call Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq on Tuesday, while the ruler was on a trip to the Netherlands. The stakes of the negotiations couldn’t be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear program if a deal isn’t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Pezeshkian praises former vice president while acknowledging his resignation The former vice president, Mohammad Javad Zarif, served as a key supporter of Pezeshkian in his election last year but drew criticism from hard-liners within Iran’s Shiite theocracy, who long have alleged Zarif gave away too much in negotiations. In March, Zarif tendered his resignation to Pezeshkian. However, the president did not immediately respond to the letter. Zarif has used resignation announcements in the past in his political career as leverage, including in a dispute last year over the composition of Pezeshkian’s Cabinet. The president had rejected that resignation. But on late Tuesday, a statement from the presidency said Pezeshkian wrote Zarif a letter praising him but accepting his resignation. “Pezeshkian emphasized that due to certain issues, his administration can no longer benefit from Zarif’s valuable knowledge and expertise,” a statement from the presidency said. The president in a decree appointed Mohsen Ismaili, 59, to be his new vice president for strategic affairs. In Iran’s political system, the president has multiple vice presidents. Ismaili is known as a political moderate and a legal expert. Grossi visit comes as Iran has restricted IAEA access Grossi arrived in Tehran for meetings with Pezeshkian and others. He met Wednesday night with Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on the social platform X after the meeting: “Cooperation with (the IAEA) is indispensable to provide credible assurances about the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme at a time when diplomacy is urgently needed.” Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency described Araghchi as briefing Grossi on the first round of talks with the U.S., while also urging the IAEA to “adopt a clear and transparent stance regarding threats against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities.” Both Israel and the U.S. have threatened to attack Iran’s nuclear sites if a deal can’t be reached to limit Tehran’s program. “As variety of spoilers are gathered to derail current negotiations, we need a Director General of Peace,” Araghchi wrote on X. “Our predisposition is to trust Grossi in mission to keep the Agency away from politics and politicization, and to retain focus on its technical mandate.” Since the nuclear deal’s collapse in 2018 with Trump’s unilateral withdraw of the U.S. from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its program, and enriches uranium to up to 60% purity — near weapons-grade levels of 90%. Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency’s most experienced inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that they could pursue atomic weapons, something the West and the IAEA have been worried about for years since Tehran abandoned an organized weapons program in 2003. Any possible deal between Iran and the U.S. likely would need to rely on the IAEA’s expertise to ensure Tehran’s compliance. And despite tensions between Iran and the agency, its access has not been entirely revoked. Iran’s foreign minister questions contradictory responses from US envoy Meanwhile, Araghchi on Wednesday warned the U.S. about taking contradictory stances in the talks. That likely refers to comments from U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who this week initially suggested a deal could see Iran go back to 3.67% uranium enrichment — like in the 2015 deal reached by the Obama administration. Witkoff then followed up with saying “a deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.” “Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,” he wrote on X. “It is imperative for the world that we create a tough, fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.” Araghchi warned America about taking any “contradictory and opposing stances” in the talks. “What is certain is that Iran’s enrichment (program) is a real, accepted matter,” he said. “We are prepared to build trust and address any potential concerns, but the core issue of enrichment itself is not negotiable.” ___ Karimi reported from Tehran, Iran.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7pqzk47zo,"Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales. The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people. The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women. The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words ""woman"" and ""sex"" are defined in the legislation. He told the court: ""The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. ""But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not."" He added that the legislation gives transgender people ""protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender"". Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears. The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including ""sex"" and ""gender reassignment"". Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by ""sex"" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, ""certificated"" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex ""for all purposes"". For Women Scotland argued for a ""common sense"" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an ""immutable biological state"". Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: ""Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex. ""Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling."" First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement. Heposted on social media: ""The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster. ""We will now engage on the implications of the ruling."" Swinney added: ""Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions."" A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted ""in good faith"" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement. A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring ""clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs"". ""Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,"" the spokesman added. Conservative leader Kemi Badenochdescribed the rulingas a ""victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious"". She added: ""It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so."" Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: ""It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK."" But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: ""This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society. ""It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next."" For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups. Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender. Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was ""shocked"" by the court ruling, arguing that it ""reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates"". They added: ""This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services. ""It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody."" The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy overtransgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prisonand an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse whoobjected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room. NHS Fife said it would ""carefully consider"" the court's judgement. The judges ruled that interpreting sex as ""certificated"" rather than ""biological"" would ""cut across the definitions of man and ""woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way"". They said a ""certified"" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian. The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to ""function coherently"". It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions. The judges noted ""similar confusion and impracticability"" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces. The judges added: ""The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct."" Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender. However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs ""if it is proportionate to do so"". Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman. He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex. But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be ""settled"" by this court case. He told the BBC: ""It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them."" Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a ""reassessment"" of rules. The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards. For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law. The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts. Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was ""not limited to biological or birth sex"". The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex. The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers. Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-04-16-2025-884713e2096d5353e3008ec7d9cc01ab,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s defense minister said on Wednesday that troops will remain in so-called security zones in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely, remarks that could further complicate talks with Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage release. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes across Gaza killed another 22 people, according to local health officials, including a girl who was not yet a year old. The girl’s mother, who was wounded, embraced her daughter, still wearing a bloodied blue dress, before she was taken for burial. Israeli forces have taken over more than half of Gaza in a renewed campaign to pressure Hamas militants to release hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire last month. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria after rebels overthrew Syrian President Bashar Assad in December. “Unlike in the past, the (Israeli military) is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. The military “will remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and (Israeli) communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza — as in Lebanon and Syria.” The Palestinians and both neighboring countries view the presence of Israeli troops as military occupation in violation of international law. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports displaced Palestinians have been told to leave shelters in the West Bank; many have nowhere to go. Lebanese president Joseph Aoun said that Israel’s continued presence in some areas in Lebanon was “hindering” the Lebanese army’s full deployment as required by the ceasefire negotiated with Israel. Two Israeli drones strikes on Wednesday in southern Lebanon killed two people, the health ministry said. The U.N. said Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 70 civilians since the ceasefire took effect in November. Hamas has said it will not release dozens of remaining hostages without a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire. “They promised that the hostages come first. In practice, Israel is choosing to seize territory before the hostages,” the main organization representing families of the hostages said in a statement. “There is one solution that is desirable and feasible, and that is the release of all the hostages at once as part of an agreement, even at the cost of ending the war.” Israel says it must maintain control of what it refers to as security zones to prevent a repeat of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack in which thousands of militants stormed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Israel’s offensive has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says women and children make up more than half of the dead. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. Ahlam Seiam’s family had planned to celebrate her first birthday later this month. Then the Israeli strike hit the building where they had pitched a tent on the roof. Her grandfather, Nashat, said the family was awakened by a blast overnight. When he raced to the roof, he found his son, Mohammed, sobbing. “I found her like this,” he said as he held the girl’s body. Associated Press footage showed the mother, wrapped in bandages, cradling her daughter one last time in the hospital bed. Israel says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas. The grandfather said there were no militants in the area of the strike. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The family had fled to Khan Younis from the southern city of Rafah after Israel renewed its offensive last month. “Wherever you go, death will catch up with you. There is no escape,” the grandfather said. Nermin Zughrub, Ahlam’s aunt, scrolled through photos of the girl on her phone. “If the world doesn’t wake up today, when will it?” she said. “Every day, massacres. Every day, children.” Israel’s bombardment and ground operations have left vast areas of the territory uninhabitable and have displaced around 90% of the population of roughly 2 million Palestinians. Many have been displaced multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps with dwindling food as an aid blockade in Gaza imposed by Israel entered its seventh week. The U.N. humanitarian office, or OCHA, said Wednesday that humanitarian workers on the ground are reporting a rise in acute malnutrition across the Gaza Strip. Water has become increasingly scarce, with Palestinians desperately lining up in front of water trucks clutching containers and jerrycans. Omar Shatat, deputy director of Gaza’s Coastal Water Utility, told The Associated Press that each person gets six to seven liters of potable water each day, calling it a “water catastrophe.” ”Water, it’s the simplest thing,” said Nevin Al-Dahloul, a displaced woman from Beit Lahiya. “We’re not asking for luxury, it’s our most basic right.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to annihilate Hamas and return the 59 hostages still in Gaza — 24 of whom are believed to still be alive. On Wednesday, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group released a video of hostage Rom Braslavski. It was the first sign of life of him, though recently released hostages had said they had seen him in captivity. In the video, which was filmed under duress, Braslavski says he was held in terrible conditions and pleads with Netanyahu to stop the war and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Netanyahu also has said that Israel will implement U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal for the resettlement of much of Gaza’s population in other countries through what Netanyahu refers to as “voluntary emigration.” Palestinians and Arab countries have universally rejected Trump’s proposal, which human rights experts say would likely violate international law. Palestinians in Gaza say they don’t want to leave, and fear another mass expulsion like the one that occurred during the war surrounding Israel’s creation in 1948. The Trump administration, which took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire, has expressed full support for Israel’s decision to end the truce and to cut off aid. Trump’s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been trying to broker a new ceasefire, more favorable to Israel, but those efforts appear to have made little progress. Netanyahu leads the most nationalist and religious government in Israel’s history, and his coalition partners have called for the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250416002300320?section=national/national,"SEOUL, April 16 (Yonhap) -- Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok is to hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent next week over trade issues that include the United States' new import tariffs, the finance ministry said Wednesday.

The meeting was proposed by Bessent in line with Choi's visit to the U.S. for the upcoming Group of 20 (G20) finance ministers and central bank governors' meeting, the ministry said.

""The details regarding the schedule and participants are currently under review,"" ministry spokesperson Kang Young-kyu said.

The planned Choi-Bessent meeting comes after Washington signaled its intent to open trade negotiations with South Korea.

In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Bessent emphasized the importance of securing a ""first mover advantage,"" as nations seek to mitigate the potential fallout from President Donald Trump's tariff policies.

Earlier this month, Trump imposed steep ""reciprocal"" tariffs on South Korea, Japan and several other countries, but later announced a 90-day suspension of the new measures to allow for negotiations.

https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250415-french-pm-bayrou-warns-trump-s-hurricane-has-made-france-vulnerable,"France urgently needs to reduce its budget deficit to confront a “tsunami of destabilisation” that includes a bellicose Russia and a trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister François Bayrou said on Tuesday. The upheaval caused by Trump’s tariffs and his decision to turn against traditional allies has shattered trust around the world, Bayrou said in unusually strident comments, warning France’s growing debt and larger budget deficits compared to European peers made it vulnerable. “The president of the United States has started a hurricane whose consequences will not end any time soon,” Bayrou said in a news conference meant to drum up support ahead of talks about the 2026 budget that pose a risk for his minority government. “As if war weren’t enough, a tsunami of destabilisation came to shake up the planet,” Bayrou said, saying the world had witnessed “a reversal of alliances that no one could have imagined” as he pointed to Trump’s treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office in February. Read moreTrump, Vance and Zelensky at the White House President Emmanuel Macron, treading a careful path of international diplomacy, has been less outspoken about Trump than his prime minister, who would traditionally be more focused on the domestic audience. Budget in the balanceBayrou’s predecessor Michel Barnier was toppled in December after he tried to pass a 2025 budget that would have cut spending faster to reduce a budget deficit that rose to 5.8 percent in 2024. Speaking on a podium where a sign read “the truth allows us to act”, Bayrou gave little concrete details on how he intended to cut government spending he said was too high. He ruled out increasing France’s overall tax take, among the highest in the world. He only said he wanted to wrap up consultations with lawmakers and stakeholders on the 2026 budget ahead of the usual September deadline and bring it forward to France’s national holiday on July 14. The government aims to cut the deficit this year to 5.4 percent of economic output as a first step towards bringing the shortfall back in line with a European Union ceiling of 3 percent by 2029. Bayrou, who relies on a minority government inherited from Macron’s failed gambit to call an early election in June last year, is especially dependent on the goodwill of Socialist lawmakers. The Socialist party, which is in the midst of a party leadership contest, has warned it could decide to pull the plug on Bayrou if the wealthiest in society were not part of efforts to reduce the deficit.

The ministry issued the statement as the SCL came into force Tuesday. The DOE's inclusion of South Korea in the list's lowest category has emerged as a hot button issue in bilateral relations. ""We have been actively engaging in negotiations, including working-level consultations at the director-general levels with the U.S. Department of Energy, together with relevant ministries,"" the ministry said, recalling that the two sides have agreed to work out the issue ""promptly through due procedures.""  ""However, as this matter is proceeding in accordance with the U.S. internal procedures, we expect that more time will be needed,"" it said. The DOE confirmed last month that the preceding Biden administration added South Korea to the SCL in early January -- a list that includes North Korea, China and Russia. The designation has stoked concern it could affect science and technology cooperation between the allies. The listed countries are subject to stricter scrutiny when access is requested to DOE research institutions or other facilities for technology cooperation or other purposes. The ministry cited the DOE reaffirming that the designation ""will not affect bilateral cooperation in ongoing or future research and development."" A foreign ministry official said the government and relevant research institutions are monitoring the situation to see whether any research projects or related exchanges have been affected. ""So far, we have not identified any cases that have been impacted,"" the official said. A diplomatic source said that other U.S. allies had been included on the list in the past before later being removed. South Korea was designated on the list in 1981 and was taken off in July 1994, following seven months of negotiations. Multiple sources in Washington said Seoul has not been informed of any DOE decision to reverse the listing before the designation took effect this week, signaling South Korea is now included in the SCL. The DOE did not respond to a request for comment. elly@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) S.

https://www.riotimesonline.com/venezuela-keeps-oil-output-above-one-million-barrels-in-march-opec-reports/,"Venezuela kept its crude oil production above one million barrels per day in March, according to the latest OPEC report. The country produced 1,048,000 barrels per day, up by 23,000 from February. This figure comes from direct sources, including Venezuela’s state oil company. Secondary sources, such as independent industry analysts, reported a lower figure of 911,000 barrels per day for March. Both numbers show a clear increase compared to the same period last year. The average production for the first quarter of 2025 reached 1,034,667 barrels per day, a 19.75% rise over the previous year. The price of Venezuela’s main crude blend, Merey, dropped to $61.10 per barrel in March from $64.96 in February. This price remains below global benchmarks, reflecting the heavier quality of Venezuelan crude and the challenges in marketing it. Oil exports remain Venezuela’s main source of foreign currency. Since 2017, production has dropped sharply. Venezuelan officials blame U.S. sanctions for this decline. These sanctions have limited Venezuela’s access to international markets and technology. The country’s oil sector saw a partial recovery after the U.S. relaxed some sanctions in late 2022. This allowed companies like Chevron to resume operations and export oil. Chevron’s involvement has been significant, accounting for about a quarter of Venezuela’s total oil production. However, the U.S. government recently replaced Chevron’s license with a more restrictive one. This change requires Chevronto wind down its operations by late May. Other international companies, such as Eni and Repsol, also face new restrictions. These firms together contribute around 300,000 barrels per day to Venezuela’s output. Analysts warn that without these foreign partners, Venezuela’s production could fall below 720,000 barrels per day. The government is seeking new deals with countries like China and Turkey. Officials have announced a plan to boost domestic investment and technology. However, the sector faces technical and financial challenges. Venezuela’s oil industry stands at a crossroads. The country’s ability to maintain or grow output depends on new investment and access to markets. The next months will show if Venezuela can keep its oil sector afloat or face another decline. All figures and claims in this article come from official reports and industry data.","Venezuela Keeps Oil Output Above One Million Barrels in March, OPEC Reports",Juan Martinez,The Rio Times,2025-04-15T05:48:33,2025-04-15T05:53:24,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgy7vwxlxo,"Hamas is said to have rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza which called for the armed group to give up its weapons. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks said the plan gave no commitment to end the war or for an Israeli troop pull-out - key Hamas demands - in exchange for releasing half of the living hostages which it holds. It comes as Israel continues its military offensive in Gaza. A security guard was killed and nine other people were injured in an air strike on a field hospital in Khan Younis, the hospital said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it struck the head of a Hamas cell. A UN agency meanwhile warned that ""the humanitarian situation in Gaza is now likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities"". It is six weeks since Israel allowed any supplies to enter through crossings into the Palestinian territory - by far the longest such stoppage to date. UN agencies strongly refute Israel's claim that there is enough food in Gaza to last for a long time and suggest the blockade could breach international humanitarian law. Israel's prime minister said the block on supplies was aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages and to extend the ceasefire which expired on 1 March. At the same time, the UN's humanitarian affairs office stated: ""Partners on the ground report a surge in attacks causing mass civilian casualties and the destruction of some of the remaining infrastructure that's needed to keep people alive."" Israel is said to have submitted its latest ceasefire proposal to regional mediators late last week, just days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met US President Donald Trump in Washington. A Hamas delegation headed by chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya then met Egyptian intelligence officials in Cairo. The senior Palestinian official told the BBC: ""The Israeli proposal relayed to the movement through Egypt explicitly called for the disarmament of Hamas without any Israeli commitment to end the war or withdraw from Gaza. Hamas therefore rejected the offer in its entirety."" It is understood to be the first time that Israel has added Hamas disarmament as a condition for advancing a ceasefire - a red line for the group. The Palestinian official accused Israel of stalling for time, seeking only to retrieve the hostages while prolonging the war. It is believed that 59 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 24 are alive. On Tuesday afternoon, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing said it had ""lost contact"" with a group of fighters holding Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander following what he described as ""a direct strike on their location"". Abu Ubaida produced no evidence to support the claim and gave no indication of when contact had been lost. Israel has said it avoids hitting locations where it believes hostages are being held. Hamas released a video of the 21-year-old soldier on Saturday, in which he appeared to be speaking under duress as he criticised the Israeli government. Recently released hostages related how many were held with them in dire conditions underground. Some are in poor health with untreated injuries. Hamas has said it is ready to return all of those held captive, in exchange for a complete end to hostilities and full Israeli pull-out from Gaza. It previously offered five hostages in exchange for a truce extension but claims to have shown flexibility on the number of hostages to be released. The BBC understands that Egypt has put forward a modified proposal to Hamas which it is now considering. Israeli media had not been anticipating an imminent ceasefire breakthrough. The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth quoted an unnamed Israeli senior security official as saying: ""We assess that there will be a deal within two-three weeks, but right now there are still gaps and the distance is great."" ""We want to get them to release 19 living hostages. Israel and the United States are co-ordinated, and the military pressure is having an impact,"" the official went on. ""They have a shortage of gas, and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents' return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. Pressure from the residents has begun. That's rattled them."" Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza on 18 March and then restarted ground operations, saying it was targeting Hamas. The prime minister said future ceasefire talks would be held ""under fire"". Since Israel restarted its offensive in Gaza, at least 1,630 people have been killed - bringing the total killed in 18 months of war to 51,000, according to the latest figures from the Hamas-run health ministry. Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the unprecedented Hamas-led 7 October attacks which triggered the war, Israel says. On Tuesday morning, Israeli warplanes struck by the gate of the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in al-Mawasi, a crowded tented area for displaced people on the coast near Khan Younis in southern Gaza, hospital spokesman Saber Abu Arar told the BBC. The man killed worked at the site, he said, and those injured were both hospital staff and patients. Three ambulances and some tents used as a reception area were damaged. Graphic footage released by the field hospital on Facebook showed a man covered in blood being rushed away with attempts made to resuscitate him. The IDF said in a statement that it ""struck the head of a Hamas terrorist cell and a combat zone commander"" outside the hospital, without giving any evidence. It also said a ""precise munition"" was used to mitigate harm in the area. The attack comes after the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, said he was ""deeply alarmed"" at Sunday's strike on al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, his spokesman said. Israel said it targeted a building at the site which Hamas was using as ""a command-and-control centre"" - something the group denied. Doctors scrambled to evacuate the hospital, saying they were given just a 20-minute warning by the IDF. A 12-year-old boy being treated for head injuries is said to have died because his care was disrupted. The hospital - which had been the best functioning in northern Gaza - is now out of service and cannot admit new patients. ""Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,"" the spokesman for Guterres said. He added that the attack dealt ""a severe blow to an already devastated healthcare system in the strip"", adding that with aid blocked, there was strong concern that medical supplies were now running low as well as stocks of food and water. The UN secretary general pointed out that under international humanitarian law, an occupying power had obligations to ensure relief for the civilian population. Recent Israeli military evacuation orders have led to wide-scale displacement of Gaza's 2.1 million population. The UN says about 70% of the strip is currently under displacement orders or in ""no-go"" zones,"" where the Israeli authorities require humanitarian teams to coordinate their movements. In Israel, polls suggest that a majority of Israelis back a Gaza ceasefire deal and - when it comes to their countries' stated war goals - prioritise bringing home the hostages over dismantling Hamas' governing and military capabilities. However, Netanyahu is backed by hard-line religious ultranationalist parties who have threatened to collapse the government if he ends the war. Israel signed onto a ceasefire deal in January, leading to the release of 33 hostages - 25 of them alive - in exchange for some 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in the first six-week stage. It then largely refused to begin talks on the planned second stage which was supposed to lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a complete end to fighting. In the past week, Israeli military reservists and veterans have signed several open letters condemning the ongoing war and questioning its priorities. There has also been criticism of the IDF's chief of staff and air force commander for sacking air force reservists who signed an original statement. This has coincided with rising frustration among reservists and their families over the cost of ongoing reserve duty along with the government's failure to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews despite the IDF facing shortages of combat soldiers.","Hamas rejects Israeli ceasefire disarmament proposal, Palestinian official says","Yolande Knell, Rushdi Abualouf",BBC News,2025-04-15T14:05:13,2025-04-15T14:05:13,gemini-2.0-flash

We are still trying to reach them,” said Obeida. “Be prepared, soon your children will return in black coffins,” Hamas said in a propaganda video published on Tuesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Hamas reportedly rejected the Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza, the BBC reported. A Palestinian official told the British news agency that the proposal did not mention any end to the war nor Israeli troops leaving Gaza, which were Hamas’s key demands for a ceasefire in exchange for half of the remaining living hostages. Hamas released a video of Alexander right before the Passover holiday began in Israel on Saturday. The terror group published the video as part of its ongoing efforts to carry out psychological terror. Earlier, a teaser of the video was released by the group with the captions “Soon” and “Time is running out.” In the video, Alexander blames the Israeli government and the American administration for “deserting” him in Gaza, saying, “I am collapsing physically and mentally.” “Tell me why.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250415009500315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, April 15 (Yonhap) -- Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok on Tuesday said the cost for stationing the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) is not currently among the agenda issues being reviewed for tariff talks with the United States. ""Talks on defense payments are not being reviewed at the moment,"" Choi told a parliamentary interpellation session, when asked whether discussions are under way to adjust South Korea's share of the cost for the upkeep of the 28,500-strong USFK. When asked whether the issue could be included in the Trump administration's proposed ""package deal"" on tariffs and security issues, Choi said while he is aware of public interest in the issue, it is not among the agenda items the South Korean government is currently preparing to handle. The finance minister, meanwhile, said a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Alaska could serve as a potential bargaining chip in the bilateral trade talks. U.S. President Donald Trump recently highlighted the interest of South Korea and other countries in partnering with the U.S. to build a pipeline from the North Slope, a region with massive proven reserves of natural gas, to southern Alaska, where the gas would be liquefied for shipments, primarily to Asia. Choi, however, said discussions with U.S. officials on how negotiations should proceed in the areas of LNG, shipbuilding and trade balance should come first at the current stage. ""Only national interest will be the standard for a decision,"" Choi said, when asked about the economic feasibility of the project, adding such concerns will be sufficiently reviewed. Following his first phone call with South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo, Trump said they discussed a range of issues, including South Korea's defense payments, trade surplus with the U.S., the purchase of U.S. LNG and bilateral shipbuilding cooperation.

https://apnews.com/article/singapore-election-30486264a84bada87ab9fc12410b7da1,"Singapore’s parliament was dissolved Tuesday, paving the way for general elections in which the city-state’s long-ruling People’s Action Party will seek to strengthen its dominance under Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. The election will be held on May 3, the Elections Department said later in the afternoon. Victory is virtually assured for the PAP, which has led Singapore since its independence in 1965. “We are witnessing profound changes in the world. It is becoming more uncertain, unsettled and even unstable,” Wong wrote on Facebook. “The global conditions that enabled Singapore’s success over the past decades may no longer hold. That is why I have called this General Election,” adding that Singaporeans should choose ”the team to lead our nation.” Wong, who was sworn in as Singapore’s fourth leader in May last year, wants to clinch a stronger win after the PAP suffered a setback in 2020 polls over voters’ rising discontent with the government. He succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, who stepped down after two decades at the helm. Lee’s departure marked the end of a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first leader who built the former colonial trading outpost into one of the world’s richest nations during 31 years in office. In the 2020 polls held during the COVID-19 pandemic, the PAP maintained its supermajority with 83 out of 93 seats. But it ceded more seats to the opposition, which increased its parliamentary representation from six to 10, the highest ever. The PAP’s share of popular support also slipped to a near-record low of 61%. As Wong heads into his first general election as PAP chief, he has sought to reach out to disgruntled younger voters. He launched a “Forward Singapore” plan that aims to give Singaporeans a say in how to develop a more balanced, vibrant and inclusive agenda for the next generation. The PAP will field more than 30 new candidates to refresh the party. Wong has warned that “who you have in the cockpit matters” amid economic uncertainties as U.S. tariffs hit the global trading system. “The biggest contest we face isn’t between political parties, it’s Singapore vs the world,” Wong said in a Facebook post earlier this week. “Our mission ... is clear: to keep our nation a shining beacon of stability, progress and hope.” While Singapore has flourished as one of the world’s wealthiest nations, it has also become one of the most expensive cities to live in. The PAP has been criticized for tight government control and a government-knows-best stance, media censorship and the use of oppressive laws against dissidents. Issues like widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding caused by immigration and restrictions on free speech have also loosened the PAP’s grip on power.","Singapore dissolves parliament, paving the way for May 3 general election",,AP News,2025-04-15T03:22:13,2025-04-15T04:59:12,gemini-2.0-flash

""The Oman talks are one of dozens of tasks for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"" the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said in his meeting withÂ		  																																																																					 a group of high-ranking officials from three branches of the Iranian government on Tuesday. The Leader of the Islamic Revolution also said thatÂ		  																																																																					 the country's issues must not be tied to the talks. ""We are neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic about these talks,""Â		  																																																																					 Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said while referring to the first round of indirect negotiations between Tehran and Washington in Oman on Saturday. After all, it is a decision and a move that has been made and has been implemented well in the first steps, theÂ		  																																																																					 Leader noted. He continued, ""Of course, we are very pessimistic about the other side, but we are optimistic about our own abilities."" Recalling the mistakes made during the JCPOA agreement in 2015,Â		  																																																																					 the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said, ""The mistake we made in the JCPOA should not be repeated."" ""During the JCPOA, we conditioned the country and made everything dependent on the progress of the negotiations,"" he said. ""Investors will not invest when they see that the country is dependent onÂ		  																																																																					 negotiation,"" he underlined. â		  																																																																					 ¢The negotiations may or may not yield results. We are neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic about them. Of course, we are very skeptical of the other party, but confident in our own capabilities,â		  																																																																					 the Leader said. â		  																																																																					 ¢The removal of the sanctions is not in our hands, but neutralizing them is; there are many ways and [there is] great domestic capacity to do that. If this objective is achieved, the country will become impervious to sanctions,â		  																																																																					 the Leader said. Ayatollah Khamenei said the first steps in the current talks with the United States have proceeded satisfactorily. He urged officials to continue the negotiations with similar care hereafter. The remarks came after Iran and the US held talks in the Omani capital last Saturday, with Oman's foreign minister functioning as the mediator, according to Press TV. The Islamic Republic has asserted that the talks were solely aimed at addressing the USâ		  																																																																					 ™s illegal and unilateral sanctions against the country, and various aspects of the Iranian nuclear energy program, strongly rejecting speculation about the processâ		  																																																																					 ™s involving other issues. The United States lifted some of the sanctions as per the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a historical 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers. Washington, however, returned the bans three years after conclusion of the deal, and even began piling up more coercive measures on the Islamic Republic. The US has termed the adversarial approach as â		  																																																																					 œmaximum pressure,â		  																																																																					 which has also seen American officialsâ		  																																																																					 ™ repeatedly threatening to use military force against the Iranian soil. The Islamic Republic has, meanwhile, underscored that any direct negotiations with the US were neither useful nor acceptable for Tehran as long as Washington retained its hostile policies.

https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/312205-presidency-hezbollah-discussing-weapons-in-bilateral-dialogue,"President Joseph Aoun said Monday that the disarmament of the militant group Hezbollah will come through negotiations as part of a national defense strategy and not through ""force.""
The Lebanese government has made a decision that ""weapons will only be in the hands of the state,"" but there are ""discussions around how to implement this decision,"" Aoun said in an interview with Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera.
Those discussions are in the form of a ""bilateral dialogue"" between the presidency and Hezbollah, he said.
Lebanon has been under pressure by the United States to speed up the disarmament of Hezbollah but there are fears within Lebanon that forcing the issue could lead to civil conflict.
""Civil peace is a red line for me,"" Aoun said.
Aoun said the Lebanese army — of which he was formerly commander — is ""doing its duty"" in confiscating weapons and dismantling unauthorized military facilities in southern Lebanon, as outlined in the ceasefire agreement that ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in late November, and sometimes in areas farther north.

The Harbin public security bureau said that the three operatives -- Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson -- had been engaged in cyberattacks targeting the Asian Winter Games held in the city in February. Investigations by Chinese technical teams revealed that the cyberattacks were carried out by the Office of Tailored Access Operations of the NSA. To conceal the origins of its attacks and secure its cyber weapons, the office used multiple affiliated front organizations to purchase IP addresses from various countries and anonymously rented servers located in regions including Europe and Asia. Investigations revealed that the NSA focused its pre-event cyberattacks on critical systems of the Asian Winter Games, including registration, arrival management, and competition entry platforms, authorities said. These systems, essential for pre-event operations, stored vast amounts of sensitive personal data of individuals associated with the Games. From Feb 3, coinciding with the first ice hockey match, NSA cyberattacks peaked, primarily targeting critical operational systems such as the event's official information platforms. These systems were vital for ensuring the smooth running of the Games, and the NSA attempted to disrupt them to undermine their normal operations. Meanwhile, the NSA launched cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in Heilongjiang province, including energy, transportation, water resources, telecommunications, and defense research institutions, authorities said. Technical teams also discovered that during the Asian Winter Games, the NSA transmitted unknown encrypted data packets to specific devices running Microsoft Windows operating systems within the province. These packets are suspected to have been attempts to activate or trigger pre-implanted backdoors in the Windows systems, authorities added. Further investigations revealed that the three NSA operatives had repeatedly launched cyberattacks against China's critical information infrastructure and participated in cyber operations targeting companies such as Huawei. Technical teams also uncovered evidence implicating the University of California and Virginia Tech in the coordinated cyber campaign against the Asian Winter Games, authorities stated.",Chinese police put 3 US operatives on wanted list over cyberattacks,Xinhua,China Daily,,4/15/25 9:13,gemini-2.0-flash

""We plan to draw up a supplementary budget in the 12 trillion-won range, which is about 2 trillion won more than previously proposed, after taking into account various opinions from the National Assembly and media,"" Choi said during a meeting with economy-related ministers. The government had earlier proposed the supplementary budget to address what Choi described as the ""most pressing issues,"" including recovery efforts following recent wildfires that devastated southeastern regions of the country. The proposal also comes amid heightened trade tensions, exacerbated by the United States' imposition of reciprocal tariffs, including a 25 percent duty for South Korea. Choi said the revised budget will allocate more than 3 trillion won for natural disaster response, more than 4 trillion won to address changes in the global trade environment and another 4 trillion won to support small businesses and vulnerable groups. He also underscored the need for continued cooperation with the National Assembly, highlighting the urgency of the proposal. ""Timing is of the essence when it comes to supplementary budgets,"" Choi said, urging bipartisan support for the swift passage of the bill.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8k67028e6o,"Bangladeshi authorities have issued an arrest warrant for the British MP and former Labour minister Tulip Siddiq. The country's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has been investigating allegations Siddiq illegally received land as part of its wider probe of the regime of her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, who was deposed as prime minister in August. The Hampstead and Highgate MP, who quit as economic secretary to the Treasury in January, was named in the arrest warrant alongside more than 50 others. Lawyers acting for Siddiq denied the charges, which they said were ""politically motivated"". The ACC had not presented any evidence or informed Siddiq about an arrest warrant, the lawyers added. The UK lists Bangladesh as a 2B extradition country - meaning clear evidence must be presented before ministers and judges make a decision. The ACC is examining claims Sheikh Hasina and her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. The investigation is based on a series of allegations made by Bobby Hajjaj, a political opponent of Hasina. Court documents seen by the BBC show Hajjaj has accused Siddiq of helping to broker a deal with Russia in 2013 that overinflated the price of a new nuclear power plant in Bangladesh. In a statement seen by the BBC, Siddiq's lawyers Stephenson Harwood said: ""The allegations are completely false and have been dealt with in writing by Siddiq's lawyers. ""The ACC has not responded to Siddiq or put any allegations to her directly or through her lawyers. ""Siddiq knows nothing about a hearing in Dhaka relating to her and she has no knowledge of any arrest warrant that is said to have been issued. ""To be clear, there is no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means. ""She has never had a plot of land in Bangladesh, and she has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else. ""No evidence has been provided by the ACC to support this or any other allegation made against Siddiq, and it is clear to us that the charges are politically motivated."" Before resigning, Siddiq had referred herself to the PM's ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus when the corruption allegations first surfaced. Sir Laurie said in his report that he had ""not identified evidence of improprieties"". But he added it was ""regrettable"" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the ""potential reputational risks"" of the ties to her aunt Sheikh Hasina, the deposed prime minister of Bangladesh and leader of Awami League party. ACC chairman Mohammad Abdul Momen has previously told the BBC the allegations ""are by no means 'targeted and baseless'"" and its investigation was ""based on documentary evidence of corruption"". ""Tulip Siddiq must not shy away from the court proceedings in Bangladesh. ""I would welcome Siddiq come and defend her case and with the best possible legal support accompanying her,"" he added. He also rejected her lawyer's claims that the ACC was interfering in UK politics, adding: ""ACC briefing to the media is a regular phenomenon, it is delivered professionally and with all accuracy."" A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""If it is the case that Keir Starmer's choice for anti-corruption minister is the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP. ""It is shocking that Keir Starmer believes 'the door remains open' for Ms Siddiq returning to a government position.""

https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthis-us-airstrikes-israel-hamas-war-f37d6c5e878045efd48d3790fe69aef7,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Suspected U.S. airstrikes around Yemen’s rebel-held capital killed at least seven people and wounded 29 overnight, the Houthis said Monday as they also claimed shooting down another American MQ-9 Reaper drone. Since its start nearly a month ago, the intense campaign of U.S. airstrikes under President Donald Trump targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters — related to the Israel-Hamas war — has killed over 120 people, according to casualty figures released Monday by the Houthis’ Health Ministry. Footage aired by the Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel showed firefighters spraying water on a raging fire they described as being sparked by the airstrikes. Rubble littered a street as rescuers carried one person away from the site, which the rebels claimed was a ceramics factory in the Bani Matar neighborhood of Sanaa, the capital. The Associated Press could not independently verify what was struck. The U.S. military’s Central Command, which oversees American military operations, did not acknowledge the strikes. That follows a pattern for the command, which now has authorization from the White House to conduct strikes at will in the campaign that began March 15. The American military also hasn’t been providing any information on targets hit. The White House has said over 200 strikes have been conducted so far. Intense airstrikes overnight into Tuesday also struck areas of Hodeida, al-Jawaf and Marib governorates, the Houthis said, without offering any casualty information. Houthis claim another American drone shot down The Houthis separately claimed Sunday night they shot down an MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen’s Hajjah governorate, which sits to the northwest of the country on the Red Sea on the country’s border with Saudi Arabia. Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, described the downing in a prerecorded video message as the fourth in two weeks by the rebels. Saree said the rebels targeted the drone with “a locally manufactured missile.” The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles — such as the Iranian missile known as the 358 — capable of downing aircraft. Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo. General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and remain in the air for over 30 hours. They have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA for years over Afghanistan, Iraq and now Yemen. Central Command said it was aware of “reports” of the drone being shot down but did not elaborate. US strikes come as part of monthlong intense campaign An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities. The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted. The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success. The U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. “What we’re doing with the Houthis and what we’re doing in the region, we’ve shown a capability to go far, to go deep and to go big,” U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Sunday on Fox News. “We don’t want to do that. But if we have to, we will to prevent a nuclear bomb in Iran’s hands.” Hegseth added: “We know Iran ... is taking a look at what’s happening to the Houthis and realizing they don’t want any part of it.”","Suspected US airstrikes kill 7 in Yemen, Houthis say",Jon Gambrell,AP News,2025-04-13T22:25:23,2025-04-14T02:01:39,gemini-2.0-flash

The attacks came despite the US pushing for an end of the war and holding separate talks with both Moscow and Kyiv -- and as US President Donald Trump this week said he was unhappy with Russia for “bombing like crazy.” JOIN US ON TELEGRAMFollow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official. In Odesa, several explosions were reported following air raid alerts late in the evening on Sunday, April 13. The regional military administration confirmed damage to infrastructure, including a hospital, and burning vehicles on city streets. Right now, Odesa is under attack by Russian kamikaze drones.The drones are striking vehicles while they’re moving. There are also reports of a hit on a hospital. Odesa Mayor Hennady Trukhanov and regional officials urged residents to remain in shelters as the drone assault unfolded. Ukraine’s Air Force reported the movement of Iranian-made Shahed drones from the Black Sea toward the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions prior to the strikes. In Kharkiv, a drone strike early Monday hit a civilian enterprise in the Saltivskyi district, sparking a large fire that spread across roughly 1,000 square meters. Local authorities said food storage facilities were damaged, and nearby residential buildings also suffered blast damage. No casualties were reported in Kharkiv. Emergency services continue to assess the damage and respond at both sites. One day before that, two ballistic missiles	 hit the center of the northeastern city of Sumy, close to the Russian border, on Sunday morning, killing at least 34 people and wounding more than 100 others.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r5vlwj4dqo,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has invited Donald Trump to visit his country before any deal is struck with Russia to end the war. ""Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,"" Zelensky said in an interview for CBS's 60 Minutes programme. The interview was recorded before a Russian missile hit the city of Sumy on Sunday, killing 35 people and injuring 117 others. Without providing evidence, Russia said it fired two Iskander missiles at a meeting of Ukrainian soldiers, killing 60 of them. Trump said he had been told it was a mistake, without specifying who told him. At the scene in Sumy, the conference centre Russia claimed was used for the meeting is smashed, and a crater marks the spot where a missile hit. The roof is no more. Kyiv has not confirmed the gathering of military officers – however, a regional mayor in Sumy has demanded the resignation of local security officials if indeed they allowed such a meeting to happen. Any gathering of soldiers is a prime target for Russia. In previous attacks and indeed throughout the invasion of Ukraine, civilians have been seen as acceptable collateral damage by the Russian military. The attack comes as the US, Ukraine's strongest military ally, has been pursuing an end to the war - now in its fourth year - through negotiation under Trump. Asked about the attack, the US president said it was ""terrible"" and that he had been ""told they made a mistake"", but did not elaborate. Earlier, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, retired Lt-Gen Keith Kellogg, said the attack had crossed ""any line of decency"". However, it remains to be seen if Trump will accept Zelensky's invitation. Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, is the only senior member of Trump's team to visit Kyiv, and that was to demand Zelensky sign a contract heavily weighted in Washington's favour to trade Ukraine's mineral wealth for continued military aid. Zelensky refused. The Ukrainian president has highlighted Russia's continued attacks on civilians while Trump attempts to improve relations with Moscow in search of a ceasefire. US special envoy Steve Witkoff has already held three meetings with Vladimir Putin, and Kyiv is adamant Moscow will exploit this as it continues to erode Ukraine's territory. European leaders condemned the Sumy attack. Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, told the country's public broadcaster ARD the attack constituted a ""serious war crime"". ""It was a perfidious act.. and it is a serious war crime, deliberate and intended,"" the conservative politician said. Germany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said the attack showed ""just what Russia's supposed readiness for peace [was] worth"". French President Emmanuel Macron accused Russia of ""blatant disregard of human lives, international law, and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump"". ""Strong measures are needed to impose a ceasefire on Russia,"" he said. ""France is working tirelessly toward this goal, alongside its partners."" Describing the attack as ""barbaric"", European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen added: ""Russia was and remains the aggressor, in blatant violation of international law. ""Strong measures are urgently needed to enforce a ceasefire. Europe will continue to reach out to partners and maintain strong pressure on Russia until the bloodshed ends and a just and lasting peace is achieved, on Ukraine's terms and conditions."" British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also gave a view, saying he was ""appalled at Russia's horrific attacks on civilians in Sumy"". A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was ""deeply alarmed and shocked"" to learn of the missile attack. ""Attacks against civilians and civilian objects are prohibited under international humanitarian law, and that any such attacks, wherever they occur, must end immediately"", he added. Guterres stressed the UN's support for ""meaningful efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive peace that fully upholds Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity"". Sunday's double missile strike was the deadliest attack on civilians in Ukraine this year. Another Russian missile attack, earlier this month on 4 April, killed 20 people and injured 61 in the city of Kryvyi Rih. On that occasion, Russia's defence ministry said it had targeted a meeting of ""unit commanders and Western instructors"" in a restaurant. No evidence was provided. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The UN estimates that nearly seven million Ukrainians are currently living as refugees. The conflict goes back more than a decade, to 2014, when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown. Russia then annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed insurgents in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c807p2xjj8zo,"Downing Street has said it is ""confident"" the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces at British Steel's Scunthorpe site switched on will reach it in time. The government has been attempting to source the materials needed to fuel the plant's central blast furnaces since taking control of it on Saturday, and has confirmed a shipment will arrive ""in the coming days"". Ministers seized control of operations after talks with British Steel's Chinese owner Jingye broke down, and the government accused the firm of planning to switch the furnaces off. Beijing has accused the British government of ""politicising trade co-operation"", and said the move raised doubts about investment in the UK. Officials had been attempting to obtain the coking coal and iron pellets needed to keep the steel-producing furnaces running – materials which ministers have accused Jingye of selling off. Speaking during a visit to the site on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said ""everything is in place"" for the furnaces to continue to fire after the materials were secured. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman had earlier confirmed that two shipments of both materials are being held at Immingham docks, 30 miles east of Scunthorpe, and will reach the steelworks first, while a third shipment of raw materials is onboard a vessel off the coast of Africa that is making its way to the UK. Sourcing and transporting the raw materials to the Scunthorpe plant is critical because if a blast furnace goes out, in most cases it is unable to be restarted. Even its temperature dropping too low can cause permanent damage. An emergency law was rushed through Parliament on Saturday, giving the government control of the Lincolnshire site after it ""became clear"" that Jingye was intent on shutting the site. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the House of Commons that Jingye had intended to ""cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders"" of raw materials, and therefore ""irrevocably and unilaterally closed down"" the plant. On Monday, the government appointed two long-standing British Steel employees to run the plant on an interim basis. The situation at British Steel has raised questions about Chinese investment in industries the UK government has deemed strategically critical. Treasury minister James Murray told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, while Jingye had ""clearly behaved irresponsibly"", the actions of one firm did not ""speak to all companies who are based in China"". He also said there needed to be a ""high level of scrutiny"" for any foreign investment in critical infrastructure. The UK government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership, but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations at Scunthorpe. While Rayner said the government wanted to work with the company to continue production at the site, as well as explore alternative private investment, she said no option was off the table. China's embassy in the UK has urged ministers to negotiate with Jingye to ""find a solution acceptable to all parties"", while its foreign ministry urged the UK government to hold further talks with Jingye. Spokesman Lin Jian said: ""It is hoped that the British government will... avoid politicising trade cooperation or linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK for normal investment,"" according to news agency AFP. On Monday morning, Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community Union - which represents the majority of steelworkers - said the blast furnaces are ""in a far better position"" than before the government stepped in. Mr Rickhuss told Today he was certain the plant would remain running and that the furnaces were ""secure"". Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, from the GMB Union, told BBC Breakfast that she had spoken to British Steel on Sunday night and had been reassured the raw materials would be secured by the government. The Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people and is the last site in the UK that can produce virgin steel - a high-grade product which is needed for large construction projects. Without the plant, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make virgin steel - which the government believes would pose a risk to the country's economic security. The site produces the majority of rail tracks used by Network Rail. The company said it does not expect ""any impact on the continued delivery of reliable rail services"" as it built up a stockpile of steel in anticipation of the plant's possible closure. The virgin steel made in Scunthorpe is also critical for large-scale infrastructure developments, such as building nuclear power plants like the ongoingHinkley Point C project in Somerset. However, in March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe site was losing Â£700,000 a day, which it said was ""no longer financially sustainable"", and the company began a consultation on job cuts. Talks with Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough. The government said the company had demanded more than double the government's original Â£500m offer with few guarantees it would keep the plant open. Speaking about the company's actions on Sunday, Reynolds said ""it might not be sabotage, it might be neglect"". Rayner said there was ""no evidence"" of corporate sabotage. The Conservatives have criticised the government for not stepping in sooner to save the plant. Tory shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the party had supported the emergency law because ""it's the least worst option on the table"".",British Steel: Government 'confident' Scunthorpe furnaces can be kept firing  ,"Maia Davies, Adam Durbin & Emma Rossiter",BBC News,2025-04-13T21:19:28,2025-04-14T14:17:30,gemini-2.0-flash

An Israeli official told the news site that US envoy Steve Witkoff briefed Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer on the talks, which Israel is wary of supporting. According to the report, the Trump administration emerged satisfied from the first round of talks in Oman this weekend, which marked the highest-level dialogue between US and Iranian officials in eight years.

https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/13/russia-was-and-remains-the-aggressor-says-von-der-leyen-following-deadly-attack-on-ukraine,"European leaders took to social media on Sunday to condemn Russia's latest deadly attack on the Ukrainian city of Sumy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote that ""Russian cruelty struck again,"" calling the attack ""barbaric"" in a post on X. More than 30 people were killed in the missile strike as people gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, according to officials. Images from the scene showed lines of black body bags lying on the side of the road, while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris. Video footage also showed fire crews as they fought to extinguish the shells of burned-out cars among the rubble from damaged buildings. A further 99 people were injured, including 11 children, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. Von der Leyen added that ""Russia was and remains the aggressor, in blatant violation of international law."" The attack on Sumy is the second large-scale attack to claim such a high number of civilian lives in just over a week. A deadly missile strike on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih on 4 April killed some 20 people, including nine children. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said that the Sumy attack crossed “any line of decency” and that the White House remained committed to ending the conflict. “There are scores of civilian dead and wounded. As a former military leader, I understand targeting and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war,"" he said. Zelenskyy also called for a global response to the attack. “Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs. What’s needed is an attitude toward Russia that a terrorist deserves,” he said. EU Foreign Chief Kaja Kallas also condemned the attack on social media, writing of a ""horrific example of Russia intensifying attacks while Ukraine has accepted an unconditional ceasefire."" French President Emmanuel Macron said that the strike undermined Washington-led peace talks between the two sides. “Everyone knows: This war was initiated by Russia alone. And today, it is clear that Russia alone chooses to continue it — with blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump,” he wrote in a statement. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ""appalled at Russia's horrific attacks on civilians."" The strikes come a day after Russia and Ukraine’s senior diplomats accused each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the three-year war. Russian forces hold the advantage in Ukraine, and Kyiv has warned Moscow is planning a fresh spring offensive to ramp up pressure on its foe and improve its negotiating position. Ukraine has endorsed a broader US ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet.","Russia 'was and remains the aggressor', says Von der Leyen following deadly attack on Ukraine's Sumy",Emma De Ruiter,Euronews,2025-04-13T12:43:01,2025-04-13T12:43:01,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-850005,"The family of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander approved the publication of Hamas’s propaganda video of him on Sunday, which was released before Passover. In the video, Alexander blames the Israeli government and the American administration for “deserting” him in Gaza, saying, “I am collapsing physically and mentally.” “I am collapsing because of this disgusting world and disgusting Israeli government,” Alexander says. “Every day, I see that he – [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu – controls the country like a dictator,” he continues. “I am collapsing physically and mentally. “I heard that three weeks ago, Hamas was prepared to release me, but you refused and abandoned me here!” he exclaimed “Tell me why. Why am I not at home? Why am I filming my second video? Why?” Alexander asked. “Everyone is lying to me: My people, the Israeli government, the American government, the army, and everyone else,” he said. “I want to believe I will return home to celebrate the holidays with you.” Edan then turns and directly addresses US President Donald Trump. “President Trump, I believed in you. I believed you would free me alive. Why have you fallen victim to Netanyahu’s lies? “Every day I hear my mother’s voice, my father’s voice, my little brother’s voice. Every day, I see the citizens of Israel demonstrating, they are doing everything in their power [to help us] and the world doesn’t listen to them,” he said. “I came to Israel to serve in the Golani Brigade. I am a lone soldier. On October 7, I was left alone at the post against an entire army!” Alexander said. “I want to believe this video will not be the last time you see me alive. I want to return to the people of Israel safely. Keep demonstrating and doing everything you can.” Netanyahu spoke with Edan’s parents Yael and Adi on Sunday evening following the release of Hamas’s propaganda video. He told the family that he sympathizes with their pain and informed them that a tremendous effort is currently underway to return Edan and all the hostages home. Yael and Adi issued the following statement in response to Hamas’s video release last night: “Our son Edan’s love for Israel led him to leave his comfortable life in New Jersey and join the IDF. On October 7, he stood his ground alone at his military post, trying to protect nearby communities from Hamas terrorists. Now he remains alone in tunnels, in enemy hands. Each moment grows more unbearable. You can see it in his face – his fear, his desperation.” “For 555 days – over a year and a half – through two Passovers, two Festivals of Freedom, our son remains captive. President Trump, our hope and trust rest with you now. We implore you to use your leadership and negotiation skills to secure a deal that will bring all 59 hostages back to their families – including our son, Edan, and the other American citizens.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp6zeymevo,"A 38-year-old man has been arrested and is due to be charged following an alleged arson attack on the official residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, authorities have said. Cody Balmer faces charges of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault. The arrest came hours after Shapiro, often touted as a future White House contender, woke up in the middle of the night to authorities banging on the door of his home as a fire spread. At a news conference on Sunday, Shapiro said he was ""obviously emotional"" as he recalled what had happened. The Democrat and his family were able to evacuate unscathed, but their home in the state capital of Harrisburg was severely damaged. ""I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempted to put on me by attacking us as they did last night,"" he told reporters. Hours before the fire, Shapiro and his family had celebrated the first night of Passover, a Jewish holiday, at home. ""When we were in the state dining room last night, we told the story of Passover,"" he said - adding that Balmer's motives were not known. Police Deputy Commissioner George Bivens said the suspect had a homemade incendiary device in his possession and was arrested in the Harrisburg area. Authorities believe the suspect was able to hop a fence surrounding the home and get inside to start the blaze, which is still being investigated. State authorities said the blaze - which was extinguished - had caused ""a significant amount of damage to a portion of the residence"". The governor and his family were in a different part of the brick home when the fire was set, police explained. The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire said it had worked to put out the blaze while police focused on evacuating Shapiro and his family. Authorities had offered a $10,000 (Â£7,600) reward for information that led to any arrest. It is unclear whether a tip led to the arrest of Balmer, who remains in custody. Shapiro and his wife, Lori, have four children together: Sophia, Jonah, Max and Reuben. The governor was considered as a possible running mate for former Vice-President Kamala Harris during her run for president last year. She ultimately chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. The Pennsylvania Governor's Residence, in Harrisburg, is a 29,000 sq ft Georgian-style home from 1968 that has housed eight governors. Shapiro has served as Pennsylvania's governor since 2023, after working as the state's attorney general.",Josh Shapiro: Man arrested after alleged arson attack at governor's home,Christal Hayes,BBC News,2025-04-13T11:56:09,2025-04-13T20:56:12,gemini-2.0-flash

April 13 (Yonhap) — The presidential primary of the Democratic Party (DP) is shaping up to be a four-way race, with former party leader Lee Jae-myung expected to dominate given his strong grip on the party leadership, experts said Sunday. Last week, Lee officially declared his candidacy for the June 3 presidential election, following the ouster of former President Yoon Suk Yeol after his martial law declaration. Lee is expected to compete against three candidates in the party primary -- former lawmaker and Interior Minister Kim Doo-kwan, Gyeonggi Gov. Kim Dong-yeon and former South Gyeongsang Gov. Kim Kyoung-soo. As Lee is widely considered the front-runner in the upcoming presidential election, the party race is largely expected to be a contest between Lee and the three Kims from the non-Lee faction, with Lee likely to dominate. ""As the period of the party primary is quite short due to the snap election, the primary itself does not hold much significance for the overall presidential race. The start of the primary marks the beginning of our competition with the People Power Party,"" a DP official said. It marked Lee's third presidential bid, following 2017 and 2022. He lost the presidential race to Yoon by a thin margin three years ago.

https://www.politico.eu/article/britains-starmer-suspends-tariffs-on-89-products-amid-trumps-trade-war/,"United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer is suspending tariffs on 89 products in order to ease pressure on companies affected by Washington's trade war. The suspension of tariffs on a range of products from electric vehicle batteries to agave syrup extends until July 2027, the government said in a statement. The move is part of a wider drive to protect British firms from United States President Donald Trump's tariffs, including an increase in state-backed loans for companies, the Telegraph reported. The British government claims the initiative will save U.K. businesses Â£17 million, which could be passed on to consumers. The U.K. was slammed with 10 percent U.S. tariffs across the board on April 2, on top of 25 percent duties on aluminum, steel, vehicles and car parts. On Saturday, the House of Lords approved emergency legislation giving the government the power to bring the last remaining source of virgin steel in the U.K., British Steel, under state control. The U.S. is the second-most important export market for British steel after the European Union. Starmer has said the U.K. will â	keep calm and fight for the best deal with the U.S.â	 while also working with other countries to reduce trade barriers. Under the tariff plan announced Sunday, the products that will now face zero import duties when entering the U.K. also include pasta, canned pineapples, fruit juice, coconut oil, plywood and plastics.",UK suspends some tariffs to help firms cope with Trump’s trade war,Eliza Gkritsi,POLITICO,2025-04-13T10:48:06,2025-04-13T11:18:24,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/japan-osaka-expo-us-trade-05c228709f4814ff4a6e74703bf3ff16,"OSAKA, Japan (AP) — The Expo 2025 opened in Osaka on Sunday with more than 10,000 people singing Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony to celebrate the start of the six-month event that Japan hopes will unite the world divided by tensions and wars. Here is what to know about the Expo 2025 Osaka: What is Expo 2025 Osaka about? The Osaka Expo is held at Yumeshima, which means “dream island,” a reclaimed industrial waste burial site in the Osaka Bay, where participants from more than 160 countries, regions and organizations showcase their futuristic exhibits inside about 80 pavillons of unique architecture. “Creating a future society for our lives” is the main theme. It is Osaka’s second Expo after the hugely successful 1970 event that attracted 64 million visitors, a record until Shanghai in 2010. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports the Osaka Expo opens in Japan offering a vision of the future. Organizers expect 28 million visitors through mid-October, though ticket sales have been slow, with about 9 million sold in advance, short of an initial target of 14 million. “It’s been 55 years since the last Expo in Osaka. I’ve been looking forward to it,” said Daiki Chiba, who traveled from from Sendai, about 900 kilometers (560 miles) northeast of Osaka. Many visitors carried Myaku-Myaku mascots or wore clothes matching its colors — red, blue and white — to get in the mood. What does it mean to hold Expo amid global tensions The Expo comes only four years after Japan struggled to host the no-audience Tokyo Olympics during the coronavirus pandemic. It opens in the wake of trade wars and fears of a global economic downturn sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, the three-year Russian invasion of Ukraine and Middle East conflicts. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba compared the global tensions to a “national crisis” and said that Trump’s tariffs, especially the 25% duty on automobiles, would be a blow to all industries and Japan’s economy. Still, Japan wants to turn the pinch into a chance. “I think the timing is actually quite fitting,” said Sachiko Yoshimura, head of Expo 2025 global communications. “Holding the Expo now could eventually help to address the divisions in the world. ... I believe this Expo in Japan might actually lead to stronger international relationships and improvements.” What is the Grand Ring? The iconic ring, designed by architect Sou Fujimoto, is a lattice-like structure encircling the venue and recognized by the Guinness World Records as the largest wooden architecture. It is 20 meters (65 feet) high and has a 2-kilometer (1.2-mile) circumference. The costly ring takes up more than 14% of the Expo’s total spending of 235 billion yen ($1.64 billion) and has triggered public criticism. The total cost nearly doubled from the initial estimate largely due to the weaker yen, causing construction delays. Several pavilions, including those of Nepal, India, Vietnam and Chile, were not ready for the opening. The ring is supposed to be partially reusable, reflecting the theme of creating a sustainable future. What are other highlights? Exhibits of cutting-edge technology, such as robots and flying cars, as well as pop culture like Hello Kitty and Gundam, are among the highlights. “Pavilions all look amazing,” said Laurel Sylvester from New Zealand, visiting with her husband and two children. Her family is interested in ocean sustainability and planned to visit the Blue Ocean Dome. She said the boys are “super excited to have their photo with the (big Gundam) robot and some of the interesting tech things that are going on.” A small artificial heart made from induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS, demonstrated a heartbeat at a Japanese health care pavilion. At the Future of Life pavilion, visitors can interact with robots. A human washing machine that was a sensation at the 1970 expo returned with a high-tech makeover. The U.S. pavilion focuses on space travel. Its lunar stone from the Apollo 12 mission, a sensation at the 1970 expo, was back on display. China, also highlighting space technology, exhibits soil samples from its lunar missions. Carrying a “Not for sale” sign and decorated with its blue-and-yellow national flags, Ukraine attracted many visitors with a globe and other items carrying barcodes. By scanning them, visitors can see videos showing people’s lives at war and their reconstruction effort. Dymtro Liuyi, Ukrainian creative director, said his country’s participation was undecided until December due to the war. The preparation was finished Sunday morning, he said, showing blue paint on his fingers. What is Myaku-Myaku? With its blue face encircled by red balls, some of them eyeballs, the mysterious, smiley creature Myaku-Myaku welcomes visitors. The imaginary creature was born from the fusion of cells and water in a small spring in the Kansai region, organizers say. The friendly but clumsy character can transform into various shapes and is good at finding a rainbow after the rain. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.",Osaka Expo opens in Japan offering a vision of the future.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/04/13/2003835086,"State-owned oil refiner CPC Corp, Taiwan (CPC, 台灣中油) plans to boost its procurement of US energy products — including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil — in response to US President Donald Trump’s 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese exports, sources said yesterday. President William Lai (賴清德) has said the government intends to expand purchases of US goods, including agricultural, industrial, and energy products, as part of its strategy to narrow the trade balance. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said it aims for US-sourced LNG to account for 30 percent of Taiwan’s total LNG imports. Last year, US LNG made up 10 percent of CPC’s imports, with the company sourcing from 14 different countries, the ministry said. CPC sources said the target could be met by ramping up existing LNG imports from the US or seeking new supply channels, such as LNG from Alaska. The company said it has inked a term sheet with select US firms certifying its intent to import LNG from Alaska, although the project could take five to seven years to come online. The company said that major US energy firms maintain diversified global investments and that it has an understanding with its partners to adjust delivery volumes based on demand and evolving circumstances. It also said it confirmed it would significantly increase LNG imports from the US over the next four years. It also plans to raise its purchases of US crude oil to help ensure a stable energy supply for the country. The company said it primarily imports sweet crude oil, or crude with a lower sulfur content, from the US and African countries, adding that sweet crude, while more expensive, was more environmentally friendly. It is also importing sour crude, or crude with higher sulfur content, from the Middle East, it added. While the company had been considering scaling back US sweet crude imports due to declining domestic demand for gasoline and diesel, it is now reassessing that decision in light of the government’s push for net-zero emissions and broader energy diversification policies. US-sourced crude has already increased from 44 percent to 60 percent of CPC’s total imports over the past three years. The rise was partly due to a fire at the company’s Dalin refinery’s heavy oil desulfurization unit on Oct. 27, 2022. The Dalin facility has since been repaired and is expected to resume operations shortly, CPC said.",CPC to boost LNG imports to narrow trade balance,"Liu Ching-hua, Jake Chung",Taipei Times,2025-04-13T00:00:00,2025-04-13T00:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash

Nikita Casap, 17, was arrested in March and charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of hiding a corpse, according to Waukesha County authorities. Other charges include theft of property over $10,000 and misappropriating ID to obtain money. Court documents show investigators are pursuing federal charges including conspiracy, presidential assassination and use of weapons of mass destruction. The teen's stepfather, Donald Mayer, 51, and mother, Tatiana Casap, 35, were both found dead inside their home by the Waukesha County Sheriff's Department on March 1, according to a press release from the department. The sheriff's department issued a search warrant and say they found material on the teen's phone related to ""The Order of Nine Angles,"" which is ""a network of individuals holding new-Nazi racially motivated extremist views,"" according to investigators. The Federal Bureau of Investigation reviewed documents allegedly written by the teen,	which calls for the assassination of Trump and the start of a revolution to ""save the white race,"" according to federal court documents. The alleged writings shows images of Adolf Hitler with the following text: ""HAIL HITLER HAIL THE WHITE RACE HAIL VICTORY,"" according to court documents. ""He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States. And he paid for, at least in part, a drone and explosives to be used as a weapon of mass destruction to commit an attack,"" investigators said in the federal affidavit. ""Other parties, with whom Casap was in contact, appear to have been aware of his plan and action and to have provided assistance to Casap in carrying them out,"" according to the affidavit. Casap was in court on April 9 for a preliminary hearing on his state charges. He has not yet offered a plea and remains in custody.

https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-war-recruitment-soars-with-record-bonuses/33383051.html,"Russian recruitment for men to fight in Ukraine is soaring in many of the country's regions, with signing bonuses and other incentives reaching new records in some places. In Siberian regions like Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, local authorities have aggressively pushed contracts on potential volunteers, and signing bonuses in some places exceed average annual salaries, according to recruits and official advertising campaigns. Sergei, who asked that his real name not be used and that his specific town in the Irkutsk region not be disclosed, said that, when he showed up at a recruiting office, he was immediately shown into a room and handed a brochure with ""big, red figure"" on the front: 1.4 million rubles ($16,700). ""It's supposedly what they’re paying you to go die. Or kill. Depends how it turns out, I guess,"" he told RFE's Siberia Realities. Russian officials have not released casualty figures since 2022, but Western estimates put the number of Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the all-out invasion in February 2022 at more than 790,000. The bulk of those casualties have occurred as a result of the battlefield tactics that Russian commanders have relied on: front infantry assaults, sometimes on foot, sometimes on motorcycles, that seek to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses. Extraordinarily High Wages And Benefits To replenish personnel, authorities have relied heavily on extraordinarily high wages and benefits to attract volunteers to fight in Ukraine. The signing bonuses typically are a mix of federal and local payments. Authorities in Moscow have also pressured regional leaders to meet quotas for new volunteers. In Iskitim, a town near the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, a woman who asked to be called Galina said she visited her local recruiting office on behalf of her nephew, who had previously been rejected for medical reasons. She said the recruiter pushed her to bring him to the enlistment office -- not just pass along the brochures to him. “I told her I’d think about it,” she said. “They’re taking everyone.” 'You Could Die In Your First Week' She said officials are offering 1.2 million ruble signing bonuses ($14,300), but they're also highlighting a monthly salary for fighting in the war: starting at 210,000 rubles ($2,500).

Galina said there were two other men at the recruiting on the day she visited recently.

In a press statement signed by the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kimiebi Imomotimi Ebienfa, the government said: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs observes with concerns a recent social media publication by the United States Embassy, Abuja, regarding the security situation in Nigeria and the testimonies provided by Bishop Wilfred Anagbe and Rev. Fr. Remigius Ihyula, on the unfortunate alleged threats that have arisen as a result of their testimonies at the U.S. Congressional Hearing on Religious Persecution in Nigeria. “Though their testimonies misrepresent facts and oversimplification of a deeply complex national challenge, the religious leaders are entitled to their opinions, freedom of expression, and association as enshrined in Nigeria’s constitution.” The Ministry described as “both inaccurate and unfair” the assertion that the Nigerian government has “allowed the violence to escalate unchecked.” “The government has consistently taken decisive actions, including deploying security forces to areas affected by communal violence, engaging in peace-building efforts between farmers and herders, strengthening intelligence operations to track down criminal elements, and implementing policies to address root causes, including land use reforms and economic development initiatives,” it said. “It is important to state that, while challenges remain, it is incorrect to suggest that the Nigerian government has been inactive or indifferent. The reality is that Nigeria is fighting multiple security threats, including banditry, terrorism, and organized crime, all of which affect different communities irrespective of religion.” The statement reaffirmed Nigeria’s commitment to upholding “freedom of religion and freedom of expression, among other freedoms,” and assured that “any reports of threats or intimidation against religious leaders will be investigated, and appropriate actions will be taken.” While acknowledging the concerns raised, the Ministry rejected “the portrayal of the crisis as an ‘Islamist extermination’ of Christians,” stating:”Government will continue to prioritize the protection of the lives and property of its citizens regardless of faith or ethnicity while strengthening national and international cooperation in the fight against insecurity. “We therefore call for responsible reporting that reflects the full complexity of the challenges at hand and promotes constructive dialogue rather than polarization.” Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

The two ballistic missiles hit around 10:15 a.m., officials said. Images from the scene showed lines of black body bags on the side of the road, while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris. Video footage also showed fire crews fighting to extinguish the shells of burned-out cars among the rubble from damaged buildings. The dead included two children, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a statement. A further 117 people were wounded, including 15 children, it said. “Only filthy scum can act like this — taking the lives of ordinary people,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. In a statement on social media, he said the first strike hit buildings belonging to a city university, while the second exploded above street level. The head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Andriy Yermak, said cluster munitions were used to kill as many people as possible. The Associated Press was unable to verify that claim. The attack on Sumy followed a deadly April 4 missile strike on Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih that killed some 20 people, including nine children. Zelenskyy called for a global response to the attack. “Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs. What’s needed is an attitude toward Russia that a terrorist deserves,” he said. Other world leaders also condemned the attack, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying that it undermined Washington-led peace talks between the sides. “Everyone knows: This war was initiated by Russia alone. And today, it is clear that Russia alone chooses to continue it — with blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts” of U.S. President Donald Trump, he wrote in a statement. Asking about the attack, Trump said late Sunday evening that he was trying to get the war stopped. “I think it was terrible and I was told they made a mistake, but I think it’s a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington. He did not clarify whether he was saying the attack was unintentional. Elsewhere in Ukraine, two women, ages 62 and 68, and a 48-year-old man were killed in Russian attacks on the Kherson region, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin said. Another person was killed during Russian shelling on Ukraine’s Donetsk region, Gov. Vadym Filashkin said. The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, said a Russian strike hit one of the city’s kindergartens, shattering windows and damaging the building’s facade. No casualties were reported. The strikes come a day after Russia and Ukraine’s senior diplomats accused each other of violating a tentative U.S.-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the three-year war. The two countries’ foreign ministers spoke at separate events at the annual Antalya Diplomacy Forum a day after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss peace prospects. “The Ukrainians have been attacking us from the very beginning, every passing day, maybe with two or three exceptions,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, adding that Moscow would provide the U.S., Turkey and international bodies with a list of Kyiv’s attacks during the past three weeks. His Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, contested that claim, saying Saturday that Russia had launched almost 70 missiles, over 2,200 exploding drones and more than 6,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, “mostly at civilians” since agreeing to the limited pause on strikes. Russian forces hold the advantage in Ukraine, and Kyiv has warned that Moscow is planning a fresh spring offensive to ramp up pressure on its foe and improve its negotiating position. Ukraine has endorsed a broader U.S. ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, said the Sumy attack crossed “any line of decency” and that the White House remained committed to ending the conflict. “There are scores of civilian dead and wounded. As a former military leader, I understand targeting, and this is wrong,” he said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the attack “horrifying” and said it offered “a tragic reminder” of why the administration was trying to end the war in favor of “a just and durable peace.” ___ Associated Press journalists Volodymr Yuchuk in Kyiv, Ukraine and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at  ___ This story corrects Kellogg’s current title.","Russian missiles hit Ukrainian city of Sumy, killing more than 30",Samya Kullab,AP News,2025-04-13T08:52:44,2025-04-14T04:19:02,gemini-2.0-flash

For decades, Americans registered blistering economic growth, dominance of international trade, and growing geopolitical ambition, and anticipated the day when China might overtake a strategically distracted and politically paralyzed United States; after the 2008 financial crisis, and then especially at the height of the COVID pandemic, many observers believed that day had come. But the pendulum swung to the other extreme only a few years later as China’s abandonment of “zero COVID” failed to restore growth. Beijing was beset by ominous demographics, once unthinkable youth unemployment, and deepening stagnation while the United States was strengthening alliances, boasting breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and other technologies, and enjoying a booming economy with record low unemployment and record high stock markets. A new consensus took hold: that an aging, slowing, and increasingly less nimble China would not overtake an ascendant United States. Washington shifted from pessimism to overconfidence. Yet just as past bouts of defeatism were misguided, so is today’s triumphalism, which risks dangerously underestimating both the latent and actual power of the only competitor in a century whose GDP has surpassed 70 percent of that of the United States. On critical metrics, China has already outmatched the United States. Economically, it boasts twice the manufacturing capacity. Technologically, it dominates everything from electric vehicles to fourth-generation nuclear reactors and now produces more active patents and top-cited scientific publications annually. Militarily, it features the world’s largest navy, bolstered by shipbuilding capacity 200 times as large as that of the United States; vastly greater missile stocks; and the world’s most advanced hypersonic capabilities—all results of the fastest military modernization in history. Even if China’s growth slows and its system falters, it will remain formidable strategically. During the Cold War, Soviet leaders often made the point that “quantity has a quality all its own.” As productivity equalizes, nations with larger populations, broader geographic reach, and greater economic heft scale up and dominate smaller first-movers. This dynamic has held throughout most of history. The United States benefited from it during the last century. It caught the tide of European industrialization, then leveraged its continental scale and larger population to outclass the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, and ultimately the Soviet Union. Today, it is China that benefits from that dynamic and the United States is at risk of being overtaken technologically, deindustrialized economically, and defeated militarily by a rival with far greater size and productive capacity. This is an era in which strategic advantage will once again accrue to those who can operate at scale. China possesses scale, and the United States does not—at least not by itself. Because its only viable path lies in coalition with others, Washington would be particularly unwise to go it alone in a complex global competition. By retreating to a sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere, the United States would cede the rest of the world to a globally engaged China. Yet acknowledging the need for allies and partners should be the starting point, not an endpoint—because the United States’ legacy approach to alliances will no longer suffice. That approach, rooted in Cold War–era assumptions and extended by inertia over eight decades, tended to view partners as dependents: recipients of protection rather than co-creators of power. They were often seen as helpful, but also as burdensome and even obstructive. That model is obsolete. To achieve scale, Washington must transform its alliance architecture from a collection of managed relationships to a platform for integrated and pooled capacity building across the military, economic, and technological domains. In practical terms, that might mean Japan and Korea help build American ships and Taiwan builds American semiconductor plants while the United States shares its best military technology with allies, and all come together to pool their markets behind a shared tariff or regulatory wall erected against China. This kind of coherent and interoperable bloc, with the United States at its core, would generate aggregate advantages that China cannot match alone. But such an approach demands a fundamental reorientation, from command-and-control diplomacy to a new capacity-centric statecraft. This radical shift in how the United States builds and wields power is essential in a world where it no longer has the singular advantage of scale. As China plays for time and mass, the United States and its partners must play for cohesion and collective leverage. To repurpose the warning often attributed to Benjamin Franklin: we must hang together, or we will all hang separately. Not every large country becomes a great power. Size refers to dimensions; scale is the ability to use size to generate efficiency and productivity and thereby outcompete rivals. Small states can become world-class by maximizing efficiency on a small foundation, but when large states run that playbook on a much larger foundation, they can remake the world. Broader internal markets can drive down costs, enabling companies to outcompete others around the world. Bigger populations create deeper pools of talent and research. Large states are less reliant on trade, which gives them greater resilience. And they can field larger militaries. Small states have risen to power on first-mover advantages, often with the acquiescence or benign neglect of larger states. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the United Kingdom was able to dominate the world with a first-mover advantage in industrialization. But that dominance was short-lived. Germany and the United States—thanks in part to the diffusion of British industrial methods—were able to achieve greater scale than a small island in the northwest corner of Europe. From 1870 to 1910, the British share of global manufacturing fell by half as the United States and Germany caught up and surpassed it. While the United Kingdom’s steel production doubled, to 6.5 million tons, Germany’s quintupled, to 12 million, and the United States’ grew sixfold, to 23 million. Germany and the United States pushed the British out of major industries, leveraging their larger internal markets, resource bases, and talent pools to drive down marginal costs. That economic advantage translated into still greater military and technological advantage. Together, these trends led to the United Kingdom’s gradual deindustrialization and eventual decline. British leaders and strategists were aware of the problem. In the late nineteenth century, the British historian John Robert Seeley, in one of the most influential books of the era, worried about the emergence of “highly organized states on a yet larger scale,” noting that as technology diffused, “Russia and the United States will surpass in power the states now called great as much as the great country-states of the sixteenth century surpassed Florence.” Even before the collapse of the British Empire, he feared that the United Kingdom would be reduced “to the level of a purely European Power” such as Spain. Seeley was not alone in calling for his country to pursue the kind of scale and efficiency gains an island could not generate on its own, through “Greater Britain”—tighter integration with imperial holdings in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. But these efforts were delayed, inconsistently pursued, and ultimately a failure. The colonies went their own way, and the British never found scale. When World War I broke out, London was fortunate to have a much more powerful ally in Washington—one with the scale to help win the war. That scale was clear to rivals. Before World War II, Hitler observed that “The American Union . . . has created a power factor of such dimensions that it threatens to overthrow all previous state power rankings.” Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto predicted that his country’s forces would “run wild for the first six months or a year, but I have utterly no confidence for the second and third years” because of the United States’ manufacturing advantage. Italy’s foreign minister also recognized that a protracted war favored the United States: “Who will have the most stamina? This is the way the question should be put.” All the Axis powers feared U.S. industrial capacity. They understood that quantity was a quality of its own. Today, that daunting scale and capacity belongs to China. American strategists must confront the risk that the United States could find itself in the position of the United Kingdom a century ago. The British experience offers both lessons and warnings: its effort at imperial integration was too little and too late. But the United States today can succeed where Britain failed, by harnessing allied and partner scale in new ways. The starting point for that success must be accurate self-assessment. In recent years, the pages of Foreign Affairs have featured a slew of essays making the case that the United States has a clear and enduring advantage over China. Michael Beckley argues that “the Chinese economy is shrinking relative to that of the United States” and that “current trends are solidifying a unipolar world.” Stephen Brooks and Ben Vagle claim that “the United States still has a commanding and durable advantage” that would give it significant economic leverage in a conflict. Jude Blanchette and Ryan Hass conclude that “the United States still has a vital edge over China in terms of economic dynamism, global influence, and technological innovation.” Predicting the rise or fall of great powers is always a fraught exercise, given inadequate information, the risks of bias, the long shadow of current events, and the challenge of sorting out which metrics matter most and in what time frame. American strategists previously swung from one extreme to another in their estimation of Japan and the Soviet Union. That same weakness has characterized net assessment of China and the United States. There is no question that China faces significant problems: an aging society, towering debt, stagnating productivity, growing risks in its housing market, high youth unemployment, crackdowns on the private sector. But even grave macroeconomic challenges do not neatly translate to strategic disadvantage. Two facts can be true at the same time: that China is slowing economically and that it is becoming more formidable strategically. And Beijing might well address economic challenges with a return to sound decision-making in the years ahead. Emphasizing China’s weaknesses risks understating its scale and capacity on the metrics and time frame most relevant for great-power competition. For example, the idea that the United States’ economy will remain larger than China’s—contrary to most expectations just a few years ago—is frequently offered as evidence of commanding U.S. advantage. But as the economist Noah Smith argues in his analysis of these GDP comparisons, “Americans should take little comfort in the fact that their total GDP at market exchange rates is outpacing China’s.” As exchange rates shift, so do comparisons of relative size, so that a 15 percent depreciation of the renminbi—as has occurred since its peak three years ago—would make the Chinese economy seem 15 percent smaller even if its output stayed the same. Accounting for purchasing power and local prices using the World Bank’s methodology, although imperfect, reveals instead that China’s economy surpassed the U.S. economy about a decade ago and is 25 percent larger today: roughly $30 trillion to the United States’ $24 trillion. This purchasing power adjustment captures the real cost of the determinants of national power, including infrastructure investment, weapons systems, manufactured goods, and government personnel—key factors in sustaining long-term strategic advantage. Using this approach, if one looks narrowly at goods rather than services, China’s productive capacity is three times as large as that of the United States—a decisive advantage in military and technological competition—and exceeds that of the next nine countries combined. In the two decades after China joined the World Trade Organization, its share of global manufacturing quintupled to 30 percent while the U.S. share halved to roughly 15 percent; the United Nations has estimated that, by 2030, the imbalance will grow to 45 percent and 11 percent. China leads in many traditional industries—producing 20 times as much cement, 13 times as much steel, three times as many cars, and twice as much power as the United States—and increasingly in advanced sectors as well. Although still catching up in fields such as biotechnology and aviation, which have been traditional U.S. strengths, China—thanks in part to ambitious industrial policy efforts such as Made in China 2025—produced almost half the world’s chemicals, half the world’s ships, more than two-thirds of electric vehicles, more than three-quarters of electric batteries, 80 percent of consumer drones, and 90 percent of solar panels and critical refined rare-earth minerals. And Beijing is taking steps to ensure its dominance continues and expands: China was responsible for half of all industrial robot installations worldwide (seven times as many as the United States), and it is a decade ahead of anyone else in commercializing fourth-generation nuclear technology, with plans to build over 100 reactors in 20 years. The last great power to so thoroughly dominate global production was the United States, from the 1870s to the 1940s. American observers tend to underestimate China’s ability to innovate, mistakenly assuming it simply copies and reproduces Western innovations. Like the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and the United States before it, China’s manufacturing strength creates a foundation for innovative advantage. State investment helps, too; it now rivals the United States’ investment in science. And China’s large population provides a deep talent pool and competitive scale. In ten industries of the future, according to a recent report from the Information Technology and Industry Foundation, China is near the leading edge of innovation (or better) in six. This industrial and innovative strength can be activated for military purposes. China’s navy, already the largest in the world, will add a staggering 65 vessels in just five years, reaching a total size 50 percent larger than the U.S. Navy—roughly 435 vessels to 300. It has rapidly increased its ships’ firepower, surging from one-tenth of the United States’ vertical launch system cells a decade ago to likely exceeding U.S. capacity by 2027. Although China lags the United States in aviation, it has broken a long-standing technical barrier by building jet engines at home and is now rapidly closing the production gap, with the ability to build more than 100 fourth-generation combat aircraft annually. In most missile technologies, China is probably the world’s leader: it boasts the first antiship ballistic missile, impressive air-to-air missile range, and the largest stockpile of conventional cruise and ballistic missiles. And in a growing number of military fields, from quantum communications to hypersonics, China is ahead of any competitor. These advantages, built over decades, will persist even if China stagnates. China’s challenges are significant. But their strategic importance is often overstated. For example, its demographic challenges will be a major issue in the long term, but in the medium term—a timeline much more relevant to competition with the United States—they are manageable. A generational “echo boom,” as the grandchildren of the Mao-era baby boomer generation enter the workforce, means that, despite an aging population, the percentage of the population below the age of 15 has actually increased, by over 30 million between the 2010 and 2020 censuses, and it has also grown as a percentage of the total population. China’s dependency ratio (of adult workers to children and retirees) will remain below Japan’s current ratio until 2050. And massive investments in education, industrial robotics, and embodied artificial intelligence will help China weather labor shortfalls. Debt levels are also illustrative. Although China’s household, corporate, and government debt is at a record 300 percent of GDP, other powers—including India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States—have similar levels of total debt. In some cases, metrics that indicate weakness in one area reflect strategic strengths in another. China’s housing bust, for example, is a drag on growth. But Beijing is plowing credit from that sector into industrial policy efforts that are boosting competitiveness. Similarly, while American firms continue to capture a higher share of profits and dominate rankings of market capitalization, Chinese firms are focused on different goals, often running losses to gain market share and put rivals out of business. Despite short-term challenges, China continues to play the long game. Even if its weaknesses prove more severe than projected, China will remain vastly more powerful than any past U.S. competitor on the metrics most relevant for competition. Washington may have overestimated past rivals, including Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union. But China is the first to outmatch the United States in size alone, as well as in several strategically relevant areas. Stagnant or not, Beijing will remain more formidable than any past challenger. Some analysts warn that American declinism is itself a risk, which could become “a self-fulfilling prophecy.” There is wisdom in that admonition; the rise and fall of great powers often begins with flawed self-diagnosis. But it is also the case, as the political scientist Samuel Huntington argued in these pages before the fall of the Soviet Union, that fretting about decline can just as often drive renewal. The greatest risk is not declinism; it is complacency, leading to a lack of strategic intention and a failure to catalyze collective action to rise to the China challenge. If anything, the United States—particularly in the era of President Donald Trump—risks overestimating unilateral power and underestimating China’s ability to counter it. For Washington, three realities must be central to any serious strategy for long-term competition. First, scale is essential. Second, China’s scale is unlike anything the United States has ever faced, and Beijing’s challenges will not fundamentally change that on any relevant timeline. And third, a new approach to alliances is the only viable way the United States can build sufficient scale of its own. Altogether, this means that Washington needs its allies and partners in ways that it did not in the past. They are not tripwires, distant protectorates, vassals, or markers of status, but providers of capacity needed to achieve great-power scale. For the first time since the end of World War II, the United States’ alliances are not about projecting power, but about preserving it. During the Cold War, the United States and its allies outclassed the Soviet Union. Today, a slightly expanded configuration would handily outclass China. Together, Australia, Canada, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the United States, and the European Union have a combined economy of $60 trillion to China’s $18 trillion, an amount more than three times as large as China’s at market exchange rates and still more than twice as large adjusting for purchasing power. It would account for roughly half of all global manufacturing (to China’s roughly one-third) and for far more active patents and top-cited journal articles than China does. It would account for $1.5 trillion in annual defense spending, roughly twice China’s. And it would displace China as the top trading partner of almost all states. (China is today the top trading partner of 120 states.) In raw terms, this alignment of democracies and market economies outscales China across nearly every dimension. Yet unless its power is coordinated, its advantages will remain largely theoretical. Accordingly, unlocking the potential of this coalition should be the central task of American statecraft in this century. And that cannot be done by simply doubling down on the traditional alliance playbook. The starting point for the United States can be long-standing bilateral alliances (such as those with Japan and South Korea) and multilateral alliances (such as NATO), along with newer partnerships (such as the AUKUS defense technology agreement with Australia and the United Kingdom) and less institutionalized groupings (such as the Quad, which also includes Australia, India, and Japan). But rather than simply celebrating these frameworks or expanding their membership, the task ahead is to deepen their function—to make them foundations for capacity-centric statecraft across multiple domains. These relationships have too often operated on the assumption that the United States provides security while others contribute political support or, at best, niche capabilities. It has been largely security-centric, too—focused on deterrence, access, and reassurance—while leaving economic coordination, industrial integration, and technological collaboration as emerging but still secondary concerns. The traditional model was simply not designed to compete with a systemic rival on the order of China. It is dangerously inadequate to the demands of the moment. The U.S. approach to alliances and partnerships in recent decades has been shaped by a combination of strategic habit and structural hierarchy. Now, it must become a platform for generating shared capacity across all critical domains—not just military ones. That will require a level of coordination and codependence that is unfamiliar and will at times be uncomfortable for both the United States and its partners. For military power, creating scale requires capacity to flow in both directions, including investment in the weaker parts of the U.S. defense industry and more generous provision of advanced U.S. military technologies to allies who historically have not received it. For the economy, scale means building a shared tariff and regulatory wall against China’s excess capacity while constructing new mechanisms to coordinate industrial policy and pool allied market share. For technology, the challenge will similarly be to erect common investment rules, export controls, and research protections to prevent technology transfer to China while undertaking joint investment. These steps mark the difference between a coalition that is aligned in principle and one that is fused in practice. That shift—toward shared capacity as the foundation of strategy—will allow the United States and its partners to compete at scale and at speed. The Biden administration used existing security alliances and partnerships to construct a “latticework” meant to better distribute force posture, increase allied defense spending, and launch new security arrangements such as AUKUS while elevating bodies such as the Quad. These efforts should be reinforced, but the next step is to transform defense-industrial cooperation. The lessons from Ukraine are clear: the United States would lack sufficient capacity to sustain a prolonged conflict with China on its own. Although innovation from new firms in uncrewed systems is promising, true scale, particularly in legacy systems, will require co-production and deeper industrial integration with allies. The World War II Arsenal of Democracy is unlikely to return. In its place, the United States needs to construct what the historian Arthur Herman has called an Arsenal of Democracies:  a networked defense industrial base built on joint production, shared innovation, and integrated supply chains. This marks a sharp change from the past, when the United States primarily provided capability to others. Now, scale demands two-way flows, including allied investment and manufacturing in the United States. Some initial steps the Biden administration took, such as having the Japanese repair American destroyers, provide a modest glimpse of what is possible. More ambitious efforts might involve joint ventures with Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders (which are two to three times more productive than U.S. firms); partnerships between Europe’s missile manufacturers and U.S. companies; or recruiting Japanese or Taiwanese firms to build legacy microelectronics in the United States. Too often, dated regulatory and political constraints, which must be addressed jointly by Congress and the executive, create barriers to benefiting from allied capability. The United States’ own capability must also flow outward to allies. Biden-era efforts such as AUKUS and the co-production of Tomahawk missiles with Japan are steps in the right direction. But real progress requires overcoming a bureaucratic alliance between a State Department concerned about proliferation and a Defense Department fearful of eroding its edge. Sharing technology quickly is the key to ensuring that Australia builds nuclear submarines, that Asian allies have sufficient antiship cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, that Taiwan can deter Chinese invasion, and that India is able to turn the Andaman Islands to its east into a fortress that Beijing cannot ignore. In practice, this could mean harmonizing export-control laws, aligning procurement standards, and coordinating investment in chokepoint components, from semiconductors to optical equipment. Allies can also transfer capacity to each other, both within regions and between different ones. Some of this has begun to happen haltingly, but much more is possible. South Korean weapons can help Europe rearm and reindustrialize. French nuclear technology can support India’s submarine program. Norwegian and Swedish missiles can help Indonesia and Thailand defend their waters. Pooling capacity requires thinking across alliances, with the United States facilitating collective action. Tighter integration also requires more burden sharing—and burden shifting. Even as allies and partners build bridges across continents, they must also play a bigger role in deterrence closer to home, with Europeans stepping up in Europe and Asians stepping up in Asia. That can be done in part by strengthening the security dimension of increasingly important groupings (the Quad or the trilateral relationship with Japan and Korea). But Washington also needs to strengthen coordination with allies for actual warfighting—through steps such as modernized joint command-and-control systems, new investments in interoperability, and more sophisticated joint exercises. That could include creating joint units with U.S. allies and partners, starting with ground-based antiaircraft and antiship missile battalions to be used in a crisis in the Indo-Pacific and later extending to more complex air and naval air formations. The United States should also reinforce extended deterrence by offering allies a greater say in nuclear command and control and the kinds of nuclear sharing arrangements that it pursued with European allies during the Cold War. Globally, the United States could pursue a new version of U.S. President Richard Nixon’s “Guam Doctrine,” which devolved responsibilities to partners after the Vietnam War. That would empower regional states—what former Australian Prime Minister John Howard called “deputy sheriffs”—to take the lead on security challenges in their neighborhood: Australia in the Pacific islands, India in South Asia, Vietnam in continental Southeast Asia, Nigeria in Africa. In practical terms, the next time a South Asian country faces challenges, the United States would defer to India’s judgment on what might serve regional stability or counter China’s influence rather than seek to advance its own preferences. The Biden administration took important steps in the economic and technology competition with China, with initiatives such as the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, and coordinated semiconductor export controls with Japan and the Netherlands. But withstanding China’s excess capacity and retaining technological leadership will require more ambitious action, beyond what Washington has typically been willing to do. China’s nonmarket practices and sheer scale have overwhelmed the World Trade Organization and now pose an existential risk to the industrial base of the United States and its allies and partners. Attempting to act alone against this threat will mean failure: securing the U.S. market will do little good if China can still push U.S. companies out of partner markets, depriving them of the scale they need to remain competitive. Instead, the United States and its allies and partners must find scale together, through a defensive moat against Chinese exports. Building a protected common market could start with coordinated tariffs on Chinese goods. But because tariffs can be easy to circumvent, a better approach might be to use coordinated nontariff barriers, including regulatory tools. (The Biden administration used such barriers against digitally connected vehicles from China.) Such regulatory measures could be coordinated with partners relatively quickly and easily. Another tool is “preferential plurilateralism”—selectively opening allied and partner markets while creating higher barriers for Chinese goods. This approach, broadly supported by figures across the political spectrum, from Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative during Trump’s first term, to prominent Democratic legislators, echoes aspects of the early post–World War II trading system, which gave preferential treatment to members of the free world over autocratic rivals. If the era of free trade agreements is over for now, then sectoral agreements with allies could offer promising avenues for pooling markets while avoiding political sensitivities. Coordinated industrial policy instruments would also be useful, such as a new international industrial investment bank that would make loans to firms in strategic sectors to diversify supply chains out of China, especially in key sectors such as medicine and critical minerals. And coordinated efforts to remove barriers to allied and partner investment could, for example, allow the bypass of national security review. Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have invested heavily in industrial cooperation with the United States (over $300 billion during the Biden administration with continued growth under Trump). And despite a tendency to dismiss Europe as economically stagnant, it outproduces the United States in steel, cars, ships, and civil aircraft; claims a greater share of global manufacturing; and has a manufacturing workforce three times the size of that of the United States. Meanwhile, stronger connections between scientific ecosystems—with more cooperation and people-to-people ties, along with common research protections—will help ensure that U.S. allies and partners can match China’s scale. Pooled market share would also create strategic leverage. A collective framework for economic defense—what some have called an “economic Article 5,” drawing on NATO’s mutual defense clause—is a long-overdue response to China’s economic coercion. Such an agreement would trigger coordinated sanctions, export controls, or trade action if one of the group’s members encountered economic pressure from Beijing.",Underestimating China,Kurt M.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7l123zy5o,"An Israeli air strike has destroyed part of al Ahli Arab Hospital, the last fully functional hospital in Gaza City. Witnesses said the strike destroyed the intensive care and surgery departments of the hospital. Video posted online appeared to show huge flames and smoke rising after missiles hit a two-storey building. People, including some patients still in hospital beds, were filmed rushing away from the site. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted the hospital because it contained a ""command and control centre used by Hamas"". No casualties were reported, according to Gaza's civil emergency service. However, one child, who previously suffered a head injury, died as a result of ""the rushed evacuation process"", according to a statement from the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, part of the Anglican Church, which runs the hospital. Surrounding buildings, including St Philip's church, were also damaged, the diocese said. It added that it was ""appalled"" at the bombing of the hospital ""on the morning of Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week"". Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said al Ahli Arab Hospital's building was ""completely destroyed"", leading to the ""forced displacement of patients and hospital staff"". The IDF said it had taken steps ""to mitigate harm to civilians or to the hospital compound, including issuing advanced warnings in the area of the terror infrastructure, the use of precise munitions, and aerial surveillance"". A local journalist, who was working at the hospital, said the IDF had phoned a doctor who was operating in the emergency department and asked them to evacuate the hospital immediately. ""All patients and displaced people must go out to a safe distance,"" the officer reportedly said. ""You have only 20 minutes to leave."" Footage on social media showed staff and patients leaving the building while it was still dark outside. Dozens of Palestinians, including women and children, were also seen fleeing from a courtyard inside the hospital where they had been seeking shelter. Khalil Bakr told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme that he and his three injured daughters had fled the hospital with only a couple of minutes to spare before it was bombed. ""It was terrifying,"" he said. ""The whole situation was difficult because I have already been injured. And as for my three daughters, one had her leg amputated, the other had her hand amputated, and the third had her body full of platinum plates."" He added: ""Only two minutes separated us from death."" Al Ahli Arab - a small medical facility before the war - was the only fully functional hospital in Gaza City, following the destruction ofAl-Shifa medical complexand other hospitals in the northern part of the Strip. World Health Organization director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the hospital was out of service following the evacuation order and attack, according to an update he received from the hospital's director. Dr Ghebreyesus highlighted how a child had died after a disruption to care, and said the hospital had been forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals, but was unable to move 40 critical patients and could not receive new patients until repairs are carried out. ""Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop,"" he stated. In its statement, the Hamas-run government media office condemned the attack. Israel was ""committing a horrific crime by targeting al Ahli Arab, which houses hundreds of patients and medical staff"", it said. UK Foreign Minister David Lammy said such ""deplorable attacks must end"", adding: ""Israel's attacks on medical facilities have comprehensively degraded access to healthcare in Gaza."" The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said in a statement: ""For the only Christian hospital in Gaza to be attacked on Palm Sunday is especially appalling. ""I share in the grief of our Palestinian brothers and sisters in the Diocese of Jerusalem. I pray for the staff and patients of the hospital, and for the family of the boy who tragically died during the evacuation."" In October 2023, an explosion at the same hospitalkilled hundreds of people. Palestinian officials blamed an Israeli strike for the blast. Israel said the blast was caused by a failed rocket launch by the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which denied responsibility. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 50,933 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Of those, 1,563 have been killed since 18 March, when Israel restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip, the ministry said. Assad al-Nassasra was missing for weeks following last month's attack, in which 15 emergency workers were killed by Israeli troops. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar accused each other of lies or inaccuracies in sworn depositions. Dozens of countries will give evidence at the ICJ hearings, which Israel has labelled a ""circus"". But the Qatari PM says there was still no ""answer for the ultimate question: how to end this war"".

https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-fm-ukrainian-membership-in-nato-should-not-be-off-the-agenda/,"Ukraine’s NATO membership must remain on the international agenda, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum on April 12, stressing that Kyiv’s integration is essential for long-term transatlantic security. “This is not just about Ukraine,” Sybiha said. “This is about transatlantic security. It’s about our contribution.” He emphasized that Ukraine currently fields 110 combat-ready brigades, describing them as a “realistic, true contribution to future security — and, by the way, the cheapest one.” Sybiha also criticized Russia for violating all 10 principles of the Helsinki Final Act and highlighted the problems within the UN. “This year, we mark 80 years of the UN Charter. Why do I mention this? Because it is important that international law should be law, not simply declarations or words,” he said. He added that the global system had proven “dysfunctional” and “unjust” in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “We need new enforcement tools. We need reforms. We need reforms in the UN and, by the way, in humanitarian law — in the Geneva Conventions. We must update them, not only for Ukraine but for other countries like Syria. Having such a bitter experience, we are ready to contribute.” Addressing the ongoing war, Sybiha reaffirmed Ukraine’s desire for peace but warned against the misuse of the term. “We want to end this war this year. But it is important not to manipulate,” he said. “How this war ends will determine the future security architecture of Europe — it depends on the future security of every family in Europe,” he said. “That is why achieving a long-term and clear peace is fundamentally important.” Sybiha also condemned Russia for escalating attacks on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s commitment to a full ceasefire. “Yesterday marked exactly one month since Ukraine unconditionally supported a full ceasefire,” he said. “Instead of this, Russia has only escalated its terror,” 	Sybiha said According to the foreign minister, Russian forces have launched nearly 70 missiles, more than 2,020 Shahed drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs over the past month — most of them targeting civilian areas. “This clearly shows the world who truly wants peace and who is committed to war,” he said.",Ukrainian FM: Kyiv's membership in NATO should not be off the table,Anna Fratsyvir,The Kyiv Independent,2025-04-12T09:30:46.000,2025-04-12T09:44:06.000,gemini-2.0-flash
https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-works-to-repair-chornobyl-containment-structure-damaged-in-russian-drone-strike/,"Ukraine is working to repair damage to the containment structure at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant following a Russian drone strike in February, Environment Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said on April 12. Speaking at the site of the decommissioned plant, Hrynchuk noted that the strike had compromised the functionality of the massive protective arch installed in 2019 to prevent radioactive leaks. The minister commented during the launch of a new 0.8-megawatt solar power station near Chornobyl ahead of two upcoming nuclear safety and energy conferences. She said that Ukraine is cooperating with international experts to assess the extent of the damage and determine the necessary steps to restore the arch's integrity. ""Unfortunately, after the attack, the arch partially lost its functionality. And now, I think, already in May, we will have the results of the analysis that we are currently conducting ...,"" Hrynchuk said. ""We are actively working on this ... We, of course, need to restore the ""arch"" so that there are no leaks under any circumstances because ensuring nuclear and radiation safety is the main task."" She added that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as well as scientific institutions and companies involved in the arch’s original installation, are contributing to the analysis. According to plant officials, the February 14 drone attack created a hole in the containment vessel’s outer layer and exploded inside. The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the incident as ""a provocation."" The structure was designed to enclose the unstable sarcophagus hastily built after the 1986 reactor explosion—the worst nuclear accident in history. Hrynchuk also emphasized the importance of renewable energy in the Chornobyl exclusion zone, saying the new solar facility would support the site's power needs. ""We have been saying for many years that the exclusion zone needs to be transformed into a zone of renewal,"" she said. ""And this territory, like no other in Ukraine, is suitable for developing renewable energy projects.""",Ukraine works to repair Chornobyl containment structure damaged in Russian drone strike,Olena Goncharova,The Kyiv Independent,2025-04-12T19:38:00,2025-04-12T20:45:23,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-claims-it-handed-over-most-sites-in-southern-lebanon-to-nations-army/,"BEIRUT — Most military sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon have been placed under Lebanese army control, a source close to the terror group said Saturday. A November 27 ceasefire that ended more than a year of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, including two months of full-blown war, stipulated that only United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanon’s army should be deployed in the country’s south. The deal required the Iran-backed terror group to dismantle its remaining military infrastructure in the south and move its fighters north of the Litani River, which is about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Israeli border. “Out of 265 Hezbollah military positions identified south of the Litani, the movement has ceded about 190 to the army,” the source said on condition of anonymity. The stipulation was also part of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, but Hezbollah never adhered to the obligation and continued to build up its forces and positions to an unprecedented degree in recent years. On October 8, 2023, Hezbollah began launching near-daily rocket and drone attacks on northern Israel in support of the Hamas terror group, a day after its massive, deadly assault on southern Israel. The attacks forced the evacuation of 60,000 northern residents, killed dozens of people and caused significant damage. Israel hit back with airstrikes, and by September 2024, the conflict escalated into open war, during which Israel decimated Hezbollah’s leadership and stockpiles. The war ended in a late November 2024 ceasefire, which has largely held despite mutual accusations of violations. Under the agreement, Israeli forces were to withdraw from southern Lebanon while Hezbollah was to remove its military infrastructure from the area. Troops remain in five points deemed “strategic” by the Israeli military. Israel also maintains the right to strike targets that pose an imminent threat. In recent days, some Hezbollah officials have signaled a willingness to discuss the group’s arsenal with the country’s government. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, a US-backed former army chief whose election in January ended a two-year impasse, has vowed to seek a state monopoly on arms. The United States deputy special envoy for the Middle East, Morgan Ortagus, discussed disarming Hezbollah with senior Lebanese figures during her visit to the country a week ago, a Lebanese official said. In an interview with Lebanese television channel LBCI, Ortagus said, “We continue to press on this government to fully fulfill the cessation of hostilities, and that includes disarming Hezbollah and all militias.” She said it should happen “as soon as possible.” The United States chairs a committee, which also includes France, tasked with overseeing the ceasefire.",Hezbollah claims it has handed over most sites in southern Lebanon to nation’s army,"AFP, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-04-12T12:57:21,2025-04-12T12:57:21,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.thetimes.com/uk/defence/article/russia-secret-war-uk-waters-submarines-dpbzphfx5,"Russian sensors suspected of attempting to spy on the UK’s nuclear submarines have been found hidden in the seas around Britain. The discovery by the British military was deemed a potential threat to national security and has never been made public. Several were found after they washed ashore, while others are understood to have been located by the Royal Navy. The devices are believed to have been planted by Moscow to try and gather intelligence on Britain’s four Vanguard submarines, which carry nuclear missiles. One of these submarines is always at sea under what is known as the UK’s continuous at-sea deterrent. The Sunday Times has chosen to withhold certain details, including the locations of the sensors. During a three-month investigation we spoke to more than a dozen former defence ministers, senior armed forces personnel and military experts to expose how Russia is using its unrivalled underwater warfare capabilities to map, hack and potentially sabotage critical British infrastructure. We were allowed unprecedented access to the RFA Proteus, the Royal Navy’s deep-sea surveillance vessel, to witness how it is leading efforts to counter threats in domestic waters. The investigation also found: Unmanned Russian vehicles have been discovered lurking next to deep-sea communications cables. The Ministry of Defence had credible intelligence that superyachts owned by Russian oligarchs may have been used to conduct underwater reconnaissance. The navy has discovered other sensors planted on the sea bed. The government is looking at requiring technology and energy companies to work more closely with the military and fund the protection of underwater infrastructure. Senior military figures liken the technological battle for supremacy below the waves to the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Now Britain has “woken up” to the Russian threat, the question is whether it is capable of catching up. First line of defence At 8.45am on March 21, a black inflatable speedboat is skimming across Campbeltown Loch towards one of the most secretive vessels in the Royal Navy’s fleet. The Sunday Times has joined senior naval officers being ferried to the RFA Proteus, named after the sea god in Greek mythology, as its crew spend the week training and experimenting with cutting-edge underwater vehicles. Anchored just off Scotland’s westernmost town, the Proteus forms an imposing silhouette against the Isle of Arran, its giant helipad and deep-sea crane clearly visible from a mile away. It is the first time a journalist has been allowed to observe its capabilities since the vessel came into service in 2023. On deck, helmeted crews prepare remotely operated vehicles that later today will be lowered to the sea bed via a moon pool — an opening in the hull the size of eight snooker tables. Other, more sensitive equipment is stowed in blue metal containers. Already aboard are two dozen members of the navy’s diving and mine-hunting squadrons, experts in searching out, recovering and destroying enemy munitions on the sea bed. They are here for the first time and will become an integral part of the ship’s operations, because Britain’s critical undersea infrastructure is under unprecedented threat from a long-standing nemesis: Russia. Cat and mouse When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the might of Russia’s non-nuclear forces went with it. But according to Royal Navy insiders, Moscow never stopped investing in the submarines patrolling the murky depths of the world’s oceans. Russia is the only nation with a fleet of specialist subs for sea-bed warfare and espionage. Some surpass the capabilities of those of Britain and its Nato allies. By the time President Putin sent tanks into Ukraine three years ago, Russia had already begun setting the stage for a much wider conflict with Nato, engaging in surveillance and sabotage of the underwater internet connections, energy pipelines and military cables that are vital to the functioning of western democracies. These activities are at the heart of Putin’s “greyzone” doctrine. The blowing up of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in 2022 was the first major incident; Royal Navy insiders maintain that its “military precision” had all the hallmarks of a Kremlin greyzone operation. In the past 15 months, at least 11 internet cables in the Baltic Sea have also been damaged, some from ships dragging anchor across the sea bed. Suspicion has come to rest on Russia’s shadow fleet of ageing tankers, which are mainly used by Putin to circumvent western oil sanctions. “You really need to keep the [engine] power on to drag, so it is a deliberate act,” a defence insider said. When a cable between Estonia and Finland was damaged in December, the Joint Expeditionary Force, a group of northern European and Baltic states led by the UK, responded by activating Nordic Warden, a reaction system that uses AI to track locations of the shadow fleet. A senior serving British military figure added: “There should be no doubt, there is a war raging in the Atlantic. This is a game of cat and mouse that has continued since the ending of the Cold War, and is now heating up again. We are seeing phenomenal amounts of Russian activity.” The Russian underwater research programme is largely overseen by the Main Directorate for Deep-Sea Research (Gugi). Its best-known vessel is the spy ship Yantar, which gained notoriety last year when it appeared off the British coast. It is equipped with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and two mini-submarines capable of reaching depths of 6,000m, craft that allow the Yantar to find and map infrastructure, as well as to cut cables using manipulator arms or tap them for information. In November, the Yantar was found in the Irish Sea loitering near cables carrying data for Microsoft and Google. The Proteus was one of several vessels dispatched to monitor it – or, as a defence source describes, it show Russia “they were pissing in our backyard.” When the Yantar returned to the English Channel in January, the defence secretary John Healey authorised HMS Somerset and HMS Tyne tracked it at closer range, while HMS Astute, a nuclear-powered submarine, covertly monitored the vessel from below before surfacing alongside it. This more aggressive posture has been widely welcomed in the navy, with a senior official stating: “We’ve got to play by the rules of the game. But whereas before we were playing it nicely, now we’re being more muscular.” However, the Yantar is not where the real problem lies. The waters immediately encircling Britain sit for the most part on the European continental shelf, meaning they are seldom deeper than 300m. The navy has several ways of monitoring them and is confident it can keep tabs on Russian activity. But where the continental shelf ends, the sea bed drops thousands of metres. The Proteus is the only navy surface vessel truly capable of policing these depths, where Gugi’s most potent threat, its fleet of six-nuclear powered mini-submarines, could be lurking. The mini-subs can sit on the sea bed and have manipulator arms capable of cutting cables, laying explosives or placing taps on fibreoptic cables for hacking purposes. They are supported by two larger “mother” submarines, meaning they can be moved covertly to pretty much anywhere in the world. Russia has other capabilities. Three senior defence sources have revealed that prior to the full invasion of Ukraine, there was credible intelligence that superyachts owned by oligarchs may have been used to conduct underwater reconnaissance around Britain. Several of these vessels have moon pools that can be used covertly to deploy and retrieve deep-sea reconnaissance and diving equipment. A former minister also recounted how, in 2018, HMS Albion, an amphibious assault ship, had been forced to leave port prematurely while moored in Limassol, Cyprus. The vessel had been docked for under 24 hours when a huge superyacht belonging to an oligarch pulled up alongside it. Suspecting that it was there covertly to surveil the Albion, the navy ship “moved on quite quickly.” Sea-bed warfare The Nord Stream attack highlighted the fragility of the UK’s energy supply, almost a fifth of which now comes from offshore wind farms. The electricity generated by these turbines is transported to the mainland through undersea cables. Oil and gas pipelines are also vital to Britain, particularly those ferrying gas from Norway. They could easily be severed were Russia to plant explosive devices, such as shaped charges or mines. “You cut those and you’ve lost that energy — and in the winter during high usage, that could be serious,” a senior military figure said. A second added that a co-ordinated attack could lead to a “failure of the national grid”. The 60 internet cables that connect Britain to the rest of the world are coated in plastic polyethylene and only a few inches thick. They are easily cut and most of their locations are recorded publicly. However, navy sources said the private companies operating them have laid so many that there is enough “redundancy” in the system to recover quickly from all but the most severe attacks. The ones that trouble the UK government most are used to transfer banking data across the Atlantic and are integral to the functioning of western financial markets. Satellite back-ups would not be able to handle the huge volume of information that flows through them every second of every day. The government started to worry about these vulnerabilities a decade ago, when George Osborne’s Treasury received a research paper from a young financier called Rishi Sunak, who had recently joined the Policy Exchange think tank. Secretive work was commissioned on how these cables could be better protected, but the answers were deemed to be in the “too-difficult category”, according to sources. Sunak’s paper would not be published until 2017, several years later. What troubles the military more profoundly is the ability of Russia to map, tap into or destroy military cables vital to its operations around the world. “There are cables that are not public,” said one senior source. “The Russians have the capability to cut military cables.” Before the visit to the Proteus, two senior UK sources told The Sunday Times that in around 2020, Russian UUVs — remotely operated and capable of operating at deep depths and travelling for hundreds of miles for days at a time — were found next to sensitive underwater cables. There was no mothership or submarine near by, suggesting they had travelled a great distance to reach the cables. The Ministry of Defence deemed it “beyond reasonable doubt” that the UUVs were attempting to hack the cables, although no evidence to date suggests Russia has succeeded. However, it has uncovered proof of other Russian activity that is altogether more disturbing. Hiding in plain sight In recent years, the navy has found a number of sensor devices in the seas around Britain. The Ministry of Defence believes they were planted there by Moscow in order to detect the movements of Britain’s four Vanguard submarines, which together make up the UK’s constant at-sea nuclear deterrent. After leaving Faslane in Scotland, the submarines “vanish” and are supposed to be invisible from enemy states for the entirety of their deployment, which is typically 90 days or more. It is not clear what type of sensors were found. Several had washed up on the shore, but more have been identified using the Royal Navy’s fleet of mine-hunter vessels. As they searched, the navy found other sensors it did not know were there, The Ministry of Defence said the at-sea deterrent remains “undetected.” Whether the UK has discovered evidence of other Russian activity is top secret. “It’s a bit like the space race,” said one senior UK source. “This is a world clouded in secrecy and subterfuge, it’s very hard to get absolute clarity. But there’s enough smoke to suggest something is on fire somewhere.” Catching up In 2021, the Integrated Review — a master document outlining the UK’s national security and foreign policy aims after Brexit — committed to purchasing a surveillance ship to protect the UK’s critical underwater infrastructure and to allow the authorities to better understand the scale of the threat. Two years later, the MoD bought a Norwegian deep-water offshore support vessel, the Topaz Tangaroa, for £70 million. It was modified and renamed the Proteus before becoming operational in October 2023. The ship has a permanent crew of about 30 civilian sailors from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the merchant arm of the navy, but is ultimately run by specialist naval teams. Life on the Proteus is demanding and the ship is expected to be at sea 330 days a year. A week before The Sunday Times visit, members of the navy’s mine-hunting and threat-exploitation teams had embedded for the first time. Among them was X-Ray Squadron, which uses autonomous underwater vehicles for mine-hunting, as well as identifying and destroying threats. During our visit, the teams were training with one of their newest assets: the SeaCat, a cutting-edge 3m-long, torpedo-shaped autonomous vehicle. It has a high-resolution camera on its nose and advanced sonar systems on its sides like wings. It is capable of running for 24 hours at depths of 300m and one of the commanding officers says it is typically between “three and six times quicker” at hunting mines than conventional methods. Nearby, another team is preparing the Gavia, a UUV that can plunge 1,000m, deep enough to cover most of the waters surrounding the UK. Then there is the Defender, which can be fitted with an array of equipment, including manipulator arms. Porton Down, the military’s top-secret research facility, has been developing arms capable of handling and planting shaped charges, a precision explosive that can be used to disable enemy mines. This capability was tested recently off the coast of Norway, where the Proteus was sent to coincide with a visit by John Healey, the defence secretary, who is negotiating a deal with Oslo to work more closely together to counter the Russian threat. All three vehicles also have sophisticated sonar systems to scan large areas of sea bed. If they find suspicious activity, they can be sent closer to capture high-resolution images. Captain Simon Pressdee, one of the senior officers on the visit, said: “Our role is to both defeat any threats to the UK as well as take it out of the greyzone. We do the latter by understanding who is involved and providing that evidence to avoid misunderstandings and make those who threaten the UK accountable for their actions.” The Proteus has other assets that are able to delve to the deepest part of the ocean, although these were hidden away on the visit. Future-proofing With the government committed to spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence by 2027, further investment in sea-bed warfare is coming. The strategic defence review, commissioned by Healey to plug the gaps in Britain’s armed forces, is expected to recommend sharper focus on underwater infrastructure. Ministers have already accelerated the roll-out of the navy’s first autonomous mine-hunting vessel, the Ariadne and are rolling out a cutting-edge unmanned submarine under a programme called Project Cetus. The purchase of another Proteus-style ship is also being discussed. “Our adversary has multiple points of action that they can be playing, and we’ve only got one ship that can deal with it,” one insider said. As part of the review, the navy has proposed a new programme, Atlantic Bastion, which will develop a new fleet of air, surface and submersible vehicles, as well as sensors, to police British waters and the wider north Atlantic. In the shorter term, a project codenamed Cabot will get these capabilities up and running in partnership with private industries that rely on underwater infrastructure. This is likely to mean companies are asked to help fund operations, sources said. A similar idea has been pushed for years by Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the former Tory transport secretary and defence minister. “If this is a national endeavour, it is perhaps time to consider legislating for a level of assured protections of our energy, water, subsea cables … by asking everyone to chip in to the costs,” she said. “A hypothecated tax paid into a defence fund, which can provide protections and deterrence from those who wish our economic security and way of life harm, must be the way.” An MoD spokesman said: “We are committed to enhancing the security of critical offshore infrastructure. Alongside our NATO and Joint Expeditionary Force allies, we are strengthening our response to ensure that Russian ships and aircraft cannot operate in secrecy near the UK or near NATO territory, harnessing new technologies like AI and coordinating patrols with our allies. And our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent continues to patrol the world’s oceans undetected as it has done for 56 years.” Privately, some in the navy think the UK needs to go further and restore its capability to lay sea mines, something it has not done since the end of the Cold War. The last stockpiles were dispensed with in 1992, due to the ethical concerns of successive governments and the belief they were redundant. However, Australia has recently pledged £500 million for sea mines, and the Russian threat has reopened the question in the minds of some personnel. Poland and the Baltic states recently announced plans to withdraw from a treaty banning anti-personnel mines. The navy is not considering this at present and no proposal has been put forward as part of the strategic defence review. But one official, speaking anonymously, said the UK may well need to be able to lay defensive fields around British waters to keep out enemy submarines. Sir Keir Starmer’s government has clearly realised the scale of the threat, with billions of pounds of extra defence spending putting Britain closer to a war footing.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yl2729nmjo,"Russia's ambassador to the UK has not denied allegations that Russian sensors have been hidden in seas around Great Britain in an attempt to track UK nuclear submarines. Andrei Kelin said that while he did not deny Russia was attempting to track British submarines, he rejected the idea that such activities presented a threat to the UK. Asked on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg whether he objected to the claims, Kelin said: ""No"". ""I am not going to deny it, but I wonder whether we really have an interest in following all the British submarine with very old outdated nuclear warheads... all these threats are extremely exaggerated,"" he said. Pressed further by Kuenssberg, the ambassador added: ""I'm denying existence of threats for the United Kingdom. This threat has been invented, absolutely, there is no threat at all from Russia to the UK."" Kelin's admission follows an investigation published by the Sunday Times earlier this month, detailing the discovery of alleged Russian sensors in seas around Britain. In its investigation, the Sunday Times said the devices are believed to have been planted by Moscow to try to gather intelligence on the UK's four Vanguard submarines, which carry nuclear missiles. The British military discovered the existence of the devices and deemed them a potential threat to national security, the paper reported. The devices have been characterised as being part of a hybrid - or ""grey zone"" - war being fought by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Other activities of such warfare could include doing damage to infrastructure assets, such as energy pipelines. Putin's secret weapon: The threat to the UK lurking on our sea beds The accusations come after the Royal Navy released images in March of a Russian warship that it tracked sailing near British waters. Named Boikiy, it is one of several Russian vessels to have been tracked sailing near the British coast in recent months. Defence Secretary John Healey told MPs in January that the Royal Navy had monitored a Russian spy ship after it was spotted around UK waters - accusing the vessel, called Yantar, of being used to gather intelligence and map the UK's underwater infrastructure. Former Conservative defence and Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood has warned that the UK is ""behind the curve"" in tracking Russia's deep-sea operations. Ellwood told the Guardian earlier this month the use of sensors was ""only half the story"", claiming that Russia has established ""remote seabed platforms"" off the UK coast that act as recharging stations for dozens of mini-submarines ""to map our undersea cable networks for potential sabotage"". A Ministry of Defence spokesperson told BBC News: ""We are committed to maintaining and enhancing the security and resilience of critical undersea infrastructure.  ""Just as the defence secretary called out the activities of the Russian spy ship Yantar hovering over our undersea cables, let those who threaten the UK or our allies be in no doubt that we will defend our undersea infrastructure."" Responding to the Sunday Times investigation into the sensors, an MoD spokesman said: ""Alongside our NATO and Joint Expeditionary Force allies, we are strengthening our response to ensure that Russian ships and aircraft cannot operate in secrecy near the UK or near NATO territory, harnessing new technologies like AI and coordinating patrols with our allies.  ""And our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent continues to patrol the world's oceans undetected as it has done for 56 years.""",Ambassador does not deny Russian attempts to track UK subs,Alys Davies,BBC News,2025-04-12T17:00:10,2025-04-12T17:00:10,gemini-2.0-flash
https://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-reports-highest-number-measles-cases-2019-cdc/story?id=120709527,"The U.S. has recorded the highest number of measles cases since 2019, according to new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data published Friday. There are now 712 confirmed measles cases across 24 states, an increase of 105 cases from the prior week, the CDC said. This is likely an undercount due to delays in states reporting cases to the federal health agency. In 2019, there was a total of 1,274 reported cases, CDC data shows. If the U.S. surpasses this figure, it would lead to the highest number of cases recorded since 1992. MORE: RFK Jr. claims curve is flattening in Texas measles outbreak. Does the data agree? Cases have been confirmed in 24 states including Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington. At least five states including Indiana, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas are reporting outbreaks, meaning three or more related cases. Reported Measles Cases in the U.S. As of April 10, 2025 CDC The CDC says 11% of measles patients in the U.S. this year have been hospitalized, the majority of whom are under age 19. Among the nationally confirmed cases by the CDC, about 97% are in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Of those cases, 1% are among those who have received just one dose of the MMR vaccine and 2% are among those who received the required two doses, according to the CDC. The CDC currently recommends that people receive two vaccine doses, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster. Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 due to the highly effective vaccination program, according to the CDC. However, CDC data shows vaccination rates have been lagging in recent years. The country could be at risk of losing its elimination status if an outbreak continued for more than one year. The outbreak in western Texas saw its first measles cases in January of this year MORE: RFK Jr. claims measles can be treated with vitamin A, linked to poor diet. Here's what science says As of Friday, 541 measles cases have been recorded, primarily in western Texas. This is an increase of 36 cases since the last update on Tuesday. Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated individuals or in individuals whose vaccination status is unknown, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). At least 56 people have been hospitalized. Four of the cases are among residents who have been vaccinated with one dose of the MMR vaccine. Seven cases are among those vaccinated with two doses. The majority of cases are among children and teenagers between ages 5 and 17 followed by children ages 4 and under, according to the data. There have been at least two confirmed deaths linked to the Texas outbreak, both of which occurred in unvaccinated school-aged children with no underlying conditions. A third death is being investigated in New Mexico in an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles after dying. During a press conference with reporters on Tuesday, Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas, which has had more than 30 cases, said she worries about the measles outbreak potentially spreading to more urban areas. I'm worried about exposures in grocery stores and malls and those places that don't exist in the more rural community, she said. 24 coverage of breaking news and live events",US reports highest number of measles cases since 2019: CDC,"Mary Kekatos, Sony Salzman",ABC News,2025-04-11T12:42:00,2025-04-12T09:44:37,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-chief-is-worried-about-russian-space-nukes/,"�The development of nuclear weapons in space is a way for Russia to improve its capabilities,� NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte tells Welt am Sonntag. NATO is concerned that Russia is seeking to deploy nuclear weapons in space, a development that could threaten the thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth that are crucial to defense as well as people's daily lives, the alliance's chief said.

�We are aware of reports that Russia is examining the possibility of placing nuclear weapons in space,� NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag in an interview published Saturday. Welt is a sister publication of POLITICO in the Axel Springer Group.

""The development of nuclear weapons in space is a way for Russia to improve its capabilities,"" Rutte said. ""This is very worrying,"" he stressed.

""Space is also very important for our deterrence and defense � just as important as land, sea, air and cyberspace,"" Rutte told the newspaper. ""In recent years, space has become increasingly crowded, dangerous and unpredictable. We know that competition in space is fierce,"" he said.

If Moscow were to deploy nuclear weapons in space, it could threaten hundreds of satellites, not just those being used by Kyiv and its allies to defend Ukraine against Russia's all-out invasion.

With about 7,000 satellites currently orbiting the planet, ""space-based systems directly affect our way of life,"" said Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister. ""They ensure, for example, that mobile phones, banking services and weather forecasts work.""

An international agreement preventing an arms race in outer space came into force in 1967, with 114 signing � including Russia. Still, it doesn't completely rule out military activities in space and, critics argue, might not adequately address the dangers that emanate from modern satellite systems.

""NATO allies are adapting to the challenges in space, including sharing intelligence and establishing national space command centers, but also developing smaller satellites that are more maneuverable and better protected,"" Rutte said.

https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-oman-3aaca426accb6e450fef6395cc5de909,"MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Iran and the United States will hold more negotiations next week over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Iran’s state-run broadcaster revealed that U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi “briefly spoke” together — the first time the two nations have done that since the Obama administration. Tehran’s declaration that the two sides spoke face-to-face — even if briefly — suggests the negotiations went well even to Iranian state TV, which long has been controlled by hard-liners. In a statement released Saturday afternoon, the White House described the discussions as “very positive and constructive,” while conceding the issues that need to be resolved “are very complicated.” “Special Envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” the White House said. Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday while flying to Miami for a UFC event that the talks are “going okay.” “I can’t tell you because nothing matters until you get it done so I don’t like talking about it but it’s going ok. The Iran situation is going pretty good, I think,” he said. The next round of talks will take place Saturday, April 19, according to the Iranian and American statements. This first round of talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local. The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location in the outskirts of Muscat, Oman’s capital, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff returned to Muscat before disappearing into traffic around a neighborhood that is home to the U.S. Embassy. The stakes of the negotiations couldn’t be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear program if a deal isn’t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Talks took place Saturday afternoon in Oman Associated Press journalists saw a convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff leave the Omani Foreign Ministry on Saturday afternoon and then speed off into the outskirts of Muscat. The convoy went into a compound and a few minutes later, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the “indirect talks” had begun. Afterward, Araghchi described the meeting as constructive to Iranian state TV, with four rounds of messages exchanged during the indirect portion. “Neither we nor the other side are interested in fruitless negotiations — so-called ‘talks for the sake of talks,’ wasting time, or drawn-out, exhausting negotiations,” he said. “Both sides, including the Americans, have said that their goal is also to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time. However, that will certainly not be an easy task.” That the two men spoke face-to-face satisfied a demand of the Americans. Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being “direct.” “I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,” Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. “That doesn’t mean, by the way, that at the margin we’re not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.” He added: “Where our red line will be, there can’t be weaponization of your nuclear capability.” Araghchi, however, sought to downplay the encounter as “a brief initial conversation, greetings and polite exchanges” — likely to avoid drawing the anger of hard-liners in Iran. Badr al-Busaidi, Oman’s foreign minister who shuttled between the two sides, said the countries have a “shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.” “I would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement, which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability,” al-Busaidi wrote on X. “We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal.” Sanctions relief and enrichment remain top issues While the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran’s beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran’s stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%. One thing it won’t do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution — “you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution” — unworkable. Iranians including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have held up what ultimately happened to the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed with his own gun by rebels in the country’s 2011 Arab Spring uprising, as a warning about what can happen when you trust the United States. ___ Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-presidential-election-noboa-luisa-gonzalez-correa-f3914829d739a8db92ea95be1a083415,"QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — In a polarized political landscape, Ecuadorian voters will choose Sunday between an incumbent young millionaire and a leftist lawyer to lead the South American country for the next four years. President Daniel Noboa and leftist challenger Luisa González will face off in a presidential runoff as Ecuadorians once again try to find a solution to the extortions, killings, kidnappings and other crimes that have accompanied them since the country emerged from the pandemic. Noboa and González advanced to the runoff after being the top vote-getters in February’s first-round election. He obtained 44.17% of support while she earned 44%. Sunday’s vote will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency. It will also test the lasting influence of González’s mentor, former President Rafael Correa. Here is what to know ahead of the vote: What’s on voters’ minds? The persistent violence Ecuador began experiencing four years ago. The spike in crime is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Noboa, who took office in November 2023, declared Ecuador to be in a state of “internal armed conflict” in January 2024, allowing him to deploy thousands of soldiers to the streets to combat gangs and to charge people with terrorism counts for alleged ties to organized crime groups. The homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023 to 38.76 per 100,000 people in 2024. But despite the decrease, the rate remained far higher than the 6.85 homicides per 100,000 people seen in 2019. Other crimes, such as kidnapping and extortion, have also skyrocketed, making people fearful of leaving their homes. Some of Noboa’s heavy-handed crime fighting tactics have come under scrutiny inside and outside the country for testing the limits of laws and norms of governing. The crime spike is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Despite their opposing political ideology, both candidates have promised tough-on-crime policies, better equipment for law enforcement and international help to fight cartels and local criminal groups. Voters are also concerned about what is in their wallets. Only 33.7% of working-aged Ecuadorians were formally employed at the end of last year, according to the country’s Institute of Statistics and Census. Noboa, a free-market supporter, has promised to create a million jobs in four years by offering incentives to hire young people and modifying the educational system to improve employment opportunities. González, meanwhile, has said she will create 2 million jobs through a strategy that includes increasing spending in public works projects. Who are the candidates? Noboa, 37, is an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade. He opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father’s Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission. Noboa, like González, was a lawmaker until May 2023, when then-President Guillermo Lasso dissolved the National Assembly, shortening his own mandate as a result and triggering that year’s snap election. Noboa defeated González in the runoff. González, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. She was unknown to most voters until Correa’s party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election. Much of her support comes from people who long for the low crime and unemployment rates of Correa’s presidency but gloss over his authoritarian tendencies, the huge debt he ran up and the corruption-related sentence handed down to him in absentia in 2020. Many people who support Noboa say their vote is more a rejection of Correa’s movement than a resounding endorsement of the president’s performance. Who gets to vote? More than 13 million people are eligible to vote, which is mandatory for adults up to the age of 65. It is optional for people aged 16 and 17 and over 65. Failure to vote results in a fine of $46. Electoral authorities have prohibited voters from taking photos of their ballots during this election. The National Electoral Council said it adopted the measure because criminal groups had coerced many voters. Anyone who violates the prohibition faces a maximum fine of $32,000.

https://www.dw.com/en/gabons-junta-chief-expected-to-win-election-as-polls-open/a-72226389,"Polling centers closed in Gabon on Saturday after a presidential election which junta chief Brice Oligui Nguema is widely expected to win. Oligui Nguema, who led a coup in August 2023 and a month later declared himself transitional president, had been leading in pre-election polls. He campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket. He has also emphasized the need to break from the dynasty of Omar Bongo Ondimba and his son and successor Ali Bongo, who together ruled Gabon for more than 50 years. In the run up to the election — the first to be held in the country since the coup — Oligui Nguema had predicted a ""historic victory."" ""I am very confident. May the best man win,"" he said as he cast his ballot alongside his wife Zita at a school in the center of the Gabonese capital Libreville. His main opponent, Alain Claude ""Bilie"" By Nze, who was prime minister before the coup, has cast himself as the candidate for a ""complete rupture"" with the country's past. He has accused Oligui Nguema, who led the Republican Guard under the Bongos, of continuing their legacy. After casting his ballot, Nze warned reporters of potential ""problems"" during the counting.  Oligui Nguema's main opponent, Bilie By Nze, has hinted at potential fraud""We'll see what it will bring,"" he added. Election monitors at the Citizens Observers Network (ROC) said they were denied access to several voting offices, but Oligui Nguema insisted the election had been ""transparent"" and ""peaceful."" Ballot counting started shortly after 6 pm (5 pm UTC) when most polling centers closed, although some remained open for voters who were still waiting to cast their ballot.  Around 920,000 Gabonese were eligible to vote. The interior ministry said turnout was 87.12%. Initial results are expected to be announced on Sunday. The winner will be handed a seven-year mandate that can be renewed once. Why does the election matter? It is the Sahel nation's first election since the 2023 coup ousted the Bongo dynasty from power.  The election in the former French colony of 2.3 million people comes amid high unemployment, regular power and water shortages and heavy government debt. The small West African country is resource-rich, with significant deposits of petroleum, manganese, and iron ore. Gabon 2025 election: An example for the Sahel nations?

Rafah is now completely surrounded by the military, with the 36th Division holding the Morag Corridor, and the Gaza Division operating in the Philadelphi Corridor, the Egypt-Gaza border area. The 36th Division’s 188th Armored Brigade had pushed into the Morag Corridor from the northwest, while the division’s Golani Infantry Brigade entered from the border in the southeast. Overnight, the two units joined up. Engineering forces are now constructing a road along the corridor, similar to the other corridors in Gaza captured by the IDF during the war. The military will now operate inside areas of Rafah that it has not been in yet to defeat the remaining Hamas forces there. The IDF issued evacuation warnings for civilians in Rafah nearly two weeks ago. Eventually, the IDF’s buffer zone in southern Gaza will stretch from the Egyptian border to the outskirts of Khan Younis — more than 5 kilometers away — and include the entire city of Rafah within it — around 20% of the Strip.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20jr8rjj2o,"Parliament has been recalled for a rare Saturday sitting to pass an emergency law aimed at saving British Steel's Scunthorpe plant from imminent closure. Sir Keir Starmer said the legislation would allow ministers to ""take control"" of the Lincolnshire site and stop its Chinese owner from closing its blast furnaces. The move opens the door to a full nationalisation of the company at a later stage, with the prime minister saying ""all options"" remained on the table. Talks have been taking place this week to keep production going at the firm, after owners Jingye said its blast furnaces were ""no longer financially sustainable"". MPs and peers are currently on their Easter break and were not due to return until 22 April, but both are now going back to Westminster for the hastily convened sitting. Parliament sat on both Saturday and Sunday on the outbreak of World War Two in 1939. And there have been only five occasions since then when it sat on a Saturday, showing the importance the government is placing on the law. Speaking at Downing Street on Friday, Sir Keir said the government wanted to pass the legislation in a single day, adding the future of the company ""hangs in the balance"". He said steelmaking was ""essential for our future"" and that he would always ""act in the national interest to protect British jobs and British workers"". ""Jobs, investment, growth, our economic and national security are all on the line,"" the prime minister said. The BBC understands from a senior government source the emergency legislation being voted on in Parliament on Saturday would not give ministers the power to nationalise British Steel - another bill would be needed to do that. Industry Minister Sarah Jones told BBC Breakfast the preference was for private investment alongside government funding to secure British Steel's future, but there was not currently a company ""that is there willing to invest at this point"". Chinese company Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2020,says it has invested more than Â£1.2bn in the company to maintain operations, but has been suffering financial losses of around Â£700,000 a day. The business department said the new law would give the government powers to order raw materials to keep the site's two running blast furnaces going, with supplies otherwise due to run out in the coming weeks. It added it would also allow ministers to direct the company's board and workforce, and ensure anyone at the plant ""who takes steps to keep it running, against the orders of the Chinese ownership"" can be reinstated if they are sacked. The company announced plans last month to shed jobs at the Scunthorpe site, which employs 2,700 people, blaming ""highly challenging"" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with lower-carbon production techniques. The government has offered Â£500m of support to partly fund a switch from blast furnaces to more energy efficient electric arc furnaces. But the offer has been rejected by the company. Earlier this week, the government offered to buy the coking coalto keep the blast furnaces running until a longer-term solution to saving the plant could be found, but was unable to get the company to agree to this in tense negotiations. Jones said the government believed Jingye had ""not been acting in good faith"" over talks to agree a deal. ""Things have reached an existential point where the company is refusing to bring in the raw materials we need to keep the blast furnaces running,"" she added. The business secretary is thought to have lost confidence in the company's Chinese owners, with a government source saying they are ""no longer trustworthy partners"". A 'Save Scunthorpe Steel' campaign will take place in the town on Saturday, including a parade at half-time during Scunthorpe United FC's match against Spennymoor Town. The football club is nicknamed The Iron, a reference to the town's connection with the steel industry. The move to take control of the company has been welcomed by unions representing employees at the site, with Unite saying it would grant workers a ""reprieve"" while a longer-term solution is worked out. ""Ministers could not have allowed a foundation industry to go under,"" added general secretary Sharon Graham. The GMB union said the government's move looked like the ""first step"" towards nationalisation, which it supported as the ""only way to save the UK steel industry"". Steelworkers' union Community said the government could not allow the UK to become the only country in the G7 group of advanced economies ""without primary steelmaking capacity"". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of having ""bungled"" the negotiations with British Steel. ""They must have seen this coming for a while,"" she added. ""Instead of addressing it earlier in the week when Parliament was sitting, their incompetence has led to a last-minute recall of Parliament."" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the government's plan was just a ""short-term sticking plaster"". He added that his party would try to amend the emergency legislation to nationalise British Steel immediately, calling public ownership ""the only option we have to save this vital strategic asset"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said ""nothing should be off the table in this matter of national security"" and added that the recall of Parliament should be seen as ""an opportunity to come forward with a serious plan for the sustainable future of domestic steel production"". The Green Party of England and Wales said it backed nationalisation as the ""only sure way to secure this strategically important sector"". Parliament was last recalled from a scheduled break in August 2021 to discuss the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Falkland Islands invasion in 1982 and the proposed Brexit deal in 2019 are two other occasions that have merited recalls. The most recent sitting Saturday was 10 September 2022, when the House of Lords reconvened to pay tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II. The House of Commons has been recalled 34 times since 1948.

https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/11/estonian-authorities-detain-russian-shadow-fleet-linked-oil-tanker-near-tallinn,"A Kremlin-linked oil tanker was detained by Estonian authorities on Friday just outside Tallinn, in what marks the first time the Baltic country has directly targeted Russia's ""shadow fleet"". The vessel, named the Kiwala, had been reportedly operating under the flag of Djibouti. However, it was caught not flying a flag, which is a violation of maritime law. Although the crew provided a flag certificate, the Djibouti naval authority said it could not find the Kiwala in its national registry. ""Ships like this are actually not allowed to operate. Estonia exercised its right to detain the vessel for inspection,"" Deputy Director General of the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) Veiko Kommusaar said. The Kiwala has been sanctioned by the EU, Kommusaar said. Additionally, the vessels has been under further sanctions by Canada, Switzerland and the UK, according to reports. It was en route to the Russian port of Ust-Luga. As part of Moscow's ""shadow fleet,"" it is suspected of transporting Russian oil in order to circumvent sanctions. The Kiwala will now remain under guard by three navy vessels until further checks are completed. ""It is no secret that over the past year, a number of vessels have appeared in the Gulf of Finland that sail without proper documentation,"" Kommusaar explained. ""And it can be stated quite clearly that it is part of the shadow fleet, which uses the Baltic Sea to transport goods, which is prohibited.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/12/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1143,"These are the key events on day 1,143 of Russiaâ



 Fighting

Russia’s defence ministry said air defence units destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones within a span of 30 minutes late on Friday. The ministry said that between 10-10:30pm local time (19:00-19:30 GMT), nine drones were destroyed over Russia’s Rostov region on Ukraine’s eastern border, and four in the Kursk region on Ukraine’s northern border.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the site of a deadly Russian attack on his hometown of Kryvyi Rih, one week after a Russian missile strike killed 19 people, including nine children and teenagers.
Ukrainian officials have in recent days sent Washington a list of targets it believes Russia has struck in violation of the energy infrastructure ceasefire that Kyiv and Moscow agreed to last month as part of efforts by the United States to reach a ceasefire.
Military analysts believe Russia is preparing to launch a new military offensive in the coming weeks to ramp up pressure and strengthen the Kremlin’s hand in ceasefire negotiations.







President Zelenskyy said that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting at the Ukraine front line alongside Russian forces, and accused Moscow of dragging Beijing into its invasion of his country. “As of now, we have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia’s occupation forces,” Zelenskyy said.
More than 100 Chinese citizens fighting for the Russian military against Ukraine are mercenaries who do not appear to have a direct link to China’s government, two US officials familiar with American intelligence and a former Western intelligence official told the Reuters news agency. Chinese military officers have, however, been in the theatre of war behind Russia’s lines with Beijing’s approval to draw tactical lessons from the war, officials told Reuters.
Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was ready to purchase additional air defence systems, adding that he discussed it with US President Donald Trump.

 Ceasefire

Talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Russia lasted more than four hours, with no concrete results disclosed. According to Russia’s Interfax news agency, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not rule out the possibility of another phone call between Putin and Trump following the discussions.
Trump said in a post earlier on Truth Social: “Russia has to get moving. Too many people [are] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!”
Russia has rejected a US-backed proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire and appears to be dragging its feet on a more limited truce in the Black Sea agreed last month, analysts said.








German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Friday, after presiding over a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group in Brussels alongside British Defence Secretary John Healey, that “ongoing aggression” from Russia meant “we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future”.
If a ceasefire is not achieved by the end of this month, Trump could impose additional sanctions on Russia, the US news site Axios reported, citing an anonymous source.
Ukraine could be partitioned like Berlin after World War II, President Trump’s envoy to Kyiv, General Keith Kellogg, appeared to suggest as Russia continues to hold out on accepting a truce. In an interview with The Times newspaper, Kellogg said the country could be split into zones of control, with British and French troops as part of a “reassurance force” in the west and Moscow’s forces in the east. Between them would be Ukrainian forces and a demilitarised zone.

 Military Aid

European countries have promised to send billions of dollars in further funding to help Ukraine keep fighting Russia’s invasion. Ukraine’s allies pledged a record 21 billion euros ($23.9bn) of military aid for the country, with the United Kingdom Defence Secretary Healey warning that 2025 was “the critical year” for the war.
Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said that his country is monitoring the world armaments market and sees opportunities for Ukraine’s backers to buy more weapons and ammunition.
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was absent from the Ukraine donor’s forum that the US established and led for several years, although he spoke to the meeting via video.







 Sanctions

A former Russian government minister who violated UK sanctions by receiving financial support from family members was sentenced to more than three years in prison in England. Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, who was appointed governor of Sevastopol in Russian-annexed Crimea by Putin, became the first person convicted of violating the sanctions put in place after the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
Estonia’s navy said it detained an oil tanker believed to belong to Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Gulf of Finland in order to check its papers.

 Regional security

A reduction in the number of US soldiers in Eastern Europe would be seen as Washington moving another step closer to Moscow and a worrying sign for Europeans, according to analysts. The NBC news channel, quoting US and European sources, said this week that the US Department of Defense was looking at the withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Europe.
President Putin announced billions in investments for the rearmament of his country’s navy. “In the next decade, 8.4 trillion roubles [around $97bn] are earmarked for the construction of new boats and ships for the navy,” Putin said at a meeting on navy development in Saint Petersburg, according to Russian news agencies.
Putin said the navy would develop drone and robot technology, and he claimed that 49 warships of various classes have been built in Russian shipyards in the past five years, including nuclear submarines that can be equipped with new Zircon hypersonic missiles.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sharply criticised European Union politicians against the backdrop of a rapprochement between the Kremlin and the new US administration.
Politicians such as acting German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, European Union top diplomat Kaja Kallas and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were not thinking of their voters, but had put the desire to punish Russia above the wellbeing of their own citizens, Lavrov said.

Turkey is ready to take responsibility for European security in the future as well,"" he said at the opening of the three-day gathering.As trans-Atlantic relations cool under the Trump administration, NATO member Turkey, which has the alliance’s second-largest military and a well-developed defence industry, is seeking a broader role.The White House has warned that the continent must look after its	own security, including Ukraine, and has so far shown no willingness to back a largely European force in Ukraine in the face of Russian hostility.Turkey has emerged as a key broker in the Black Sea region, preserving relations with both Ukraine and Russia. Erdoğan and Trump have both spoken of their close personal relationship.""I believe that our relations with the United States will flourish in every field during President Trump's second term, also with the contribution of our close friendship with him,"" the Turkish president told an audience of world leaders and diplomats.Turning to Trump's tariffs, Erdoğan held out the chance of a	positive outcome for Turkey, which has been placed within the baseline 10% tariff.""We are doing our best to prevent the heated commercial competition over customs tariffs from becoming destructive,"" Erdoğan said. ""Turkey will be one of the winners of this process.""Turkey is also an influential actor in neighbouring Syria as rebel groups it supported during the civil war took power last December.However, the fall of long-time president Bashar Al-Assad has aggravated already tense relations between Turkey and Israel, with their conflicting interests pushing the relationship toward a	possible collision course.When Trump hosted	Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington last month, he advised him to be ""reasonable"" in his dealings with Ankara.Erdoğan told the forum in Antalya: ""We are in a state of understanding and close dialogue with influential actors in the region, especially Trump and Putin, in preserving the territorial integrity of Syria.""Syria's new President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, sat just two places away from Erdoğan.In an apparent warning, Erdoğan said that ""no-one should misunderstand our cool-headedness and our stance of resolving issues through dialogue.""The president, a vocal critic of Israel's military operations in Gaza, also focused on the killing of civilians in the enclave.""Even if it is at war, does a legitimate state act like this?

https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250411-fears-for-political-stability-as-joseph-kabila-plans-return-to-eastern-drc,"The planned return of former Democratic Republic of Congo president Joseph Kabila from self-imposed exile could shift political dynamics and complicate efforts to resolve escalating violence in the country's east, analysts say. Kabila this week announced his intention to leave South Africa, where he has been exiled since December 2023, and address the deteriorating security situation in eastern DRC. His return comes amid accusations from President Felix Tshisekedi that Kabila supports the AFC rebels responsible for recent military advances, including capturing key cities Bukavu and Goma. “After six years of total silence and given the worsening security situation, I have resolved to return home without delay to help find a solution,” Kabila wrote on Tuesday. ""I have decided to begin with the eastern region, where there is danger at hand."" In recent months, Kabila has been unusually outspoken about the DRC conflict, breaking his usual silence since stepping down in 2019. In February, he authored an opinion piece in South Africa’s Sunday Times, arguing the “DRC crisis needs more than a military solution”. Political analyst Michael Tshibangu told RFI that Kabila’s recent activities signal his intent to become more politically involved. “It is clear that he is stepping up to play a more active political role. But he has not put all his cards on the table. In typical Kabila fashion, he has maintained an element of mystery as to what his real political objectives are,” Tshibangu said. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan arrives in DRC amid escalating eastern conflict Kabila, who is currently writing a thesis at the University of Johannesburg and spending time in Namibia and Zimbabwe, has reportedly held meetings with regional and international figures involved in the conflict. “Kabila met with representatives from Rwanda, Uganda and regional countries. He is trying to position himself as a credible alternative to President Felix Tshisekedi who is not currently enjoying good relations with DRC’s neighbours,” said Fred Bauma, of the Ebuteli research institute. “However, he will really have to convince them of his good will and capacity to be part of the solution. But that's far from being a done deal.” Kabila has also reached out to Congolese opposition politicians exiled in Europe, holding meetings with opposition leaders Moise Katumbi and Claudel Lubaya in Addis Ababa last December. “He is attempting to restructure the political opposition in DRC and may well be positioning himself to take the lead role with the support of various parties,” said Bob Kabamba, political science lecturer at Liege University in Belgium. Tshibangu noted that Kabila's announcement to return comes at a politically sensitive time, as President Tshisekedi appears weakened amid military setbacks. DRC president suggests unity government to respond to the crisis	
in the east Kabila did not specify exactly when or where he intends to arrive in eastern DRC, prompting speculation and caution from observers. “The east of DRC is such a vast territory and he did not say that he will go to the areas controlled by the AFC rebels,” said Tshibangu. Tshisekedi has accused Kabila of sponsoring the AFC rebels, led by Corneille Nangaa, former president of DRC’s independent national electoral commission and an ally of Kabila. Kabila strongly denies these accusations and has publicly challenged Tshisekedi to provide evidence. “This could explain why he prefers not to go to Kinshasa, the capital city, first. Unless the government gives him assurances that he will not be arrested,” Tshibangu said.",Fears for political stability as Joseph Kabila plans return to DRC,Zeenat Hansrod,RFI,2025-04-11T14:57:47,2025-04-16T08:18:35,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250411-coup-leader-favourite-to-win-as-gabon-heads-to-the-polls-hoping-for-change,"Gabon stands at a political crossroads this weekend, as the nation heads to the polls for its first presidential election since the 2023 military coup â



– a vote that could mark a clean break from decades of dynastic rule, or entrench a familiar power under a new guise. As voters prepare to cast their votes on Saturday, the final political rallies across the country this week set the tone for what could be a turning point for the country. The transitional president and favourite to win, Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, ended his campaign a day early with a high-energy double-header of in the capital Libreville on Thursday. Buses rolled into Libreville bringing thousands of enthusiastic supporters, who thronged venues in the Owendo district and along the Boulevard Bessieux, where previous presidential heavyweights such as Ali Bongo and Jean Ping too once drew massive crowds. As Oligui Nguema pulled out all the stops to consolidate his lead, critics have argued that his campaign – under the slogan ""C’BON"", a play on his initials and the French for ""it's good"" – has been saturated with state resources. “It’s déjà vu,” one onlooker told RFI, referring to the fact that some see similarities between



Oligui Nguema's campaign and the Bongo era. Turning the page Gabon is a nation rich in oil yet struggling with inequality and economic mismanagement. For more than 50 years, the country was ruled by the Bongo dynasty



– a reign that for many became synonymous with stagnation, corruption and squandered potential. With Oligui Nguema – himself a cousin of Ali Bongo, who he deposed in the coup of 30 August, 2023 – at the helm of the transition, critics have questioned whether this election truly represents change, or just a new face on the old system. Who are the candidates in Gabon's post-coup presidential election? Oligui Nguema's leading rival, Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nze, has positioned himself as the true reformer, pledging to overhaul public finances, boost youth employment and assert greater independence from France. Speaking to RFI, he pulled no punches: “There is hidden debt, unaccounted domestic and foreign debt… debts incurred to acquire shares in companies."" Decades of debt While the country's debt officially dropped from 71 percent of GDP in 2023 to 67 percent in 2024, it remains a contentious issue. Some analysts, such as Cédric Jiongo of the Sika Finance economic think tank, have criticised the government's “unconventional” accounting methods, which omit significant arrears. Fitch Ratings downgraded Gabon earlier this year, warning of rising deficits and an over-reliance on oil revenue. Gabon approves new constitution a year after military seized power Communications minister Laurence Ndong, however, told RFI: “We found a country with a debt of 7.5 trillion CFA Francs [more than€11 billion]. Today, Gabon is honouring its debt commitments. All our lenders have been repaid."" The transitional government has repaid more than €350 million and pushed through a balanced 2025 budget. But concerns remain. The International Monetary Fund has urged fiscal consolidation, and sceptics argue that splashy investments – such as nationalising oil firms and launching a state airline – are more about optics than sustainability. The transitional government insists this will be “the first free and transparent election” in decades, and

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2q323lg3o,"Ukraine's European allies have pledged €21bn ($24bn; £18bn) in a new tranche of military support for Kyiv in what they described as ""a critical year"" for the war. More than half of this - €11bn in aid over four years - is coming from Germany. British Defence Minister John Healey said the pledges would send a strong signal to Moscow. The announcement came as members of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group met at Nato's headquarters in Brussels to pledge air defences, missiles and other gear as Europe sought to fill the gap left by the changed priorities of the US under Donald Trump. Europe's defence ministers said they saw no sign of an end to the war, despite Trump's promise of a ceasefire. Support announced on Friday also includes a £450m ($590m) package from the UK and Norway to fund radar systems, anti-tank mines, vehicle repairs and hundreds of thousands of drones for Ukraine. The money is part of a British pledge of £4.5bn made earlier this year. Air defence was a priority in Brussels. Healey said Russian forces had dropped 10,000 glide bombs on Ukraine in the first three months of this year, as well as launching 100 one-way attack drones a day. ""In our calculations, 70% to 80% of battlefield casualties are now caused and inflicted by drones,"" the UK defence secretary said. The German aid package meanwhile has a significant focus on artillery. Boris Pistorius said Germany would send 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, 25 infantry fighting vehicles, 15 battle tanks, 100 ground surveillance radars and 120 Man-Portable Air Defense Systems. Berlin will also send four IRIS-T air defence systems with 300 missiles to Kyiv. ""Ukraine needs a strong military and only then can the negotiation process lead to a just and lasting peace,"" the German defence minister told reporters in Brussels. Defence ministers from 50 nations gathered in Brussels for the 27th gathering of the UDCG. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth joined the meeting remotely, telling allies that America appreciated their work. Pistorius said Hegseth's decision was a matter of ""schedules"" rather than ""priorities"", and that the ""most important fact was that he took part"". Other leaders also joined remotely, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Kyiv's defence minister Rustem Umerov, who was in Brussels, thanked Europe for ""taking over the lead on security assistance"" for his country. He also said Hegseth's attendance ""means that the US is continuing its security assistance and is beside us"". Healey, Pistorius and Umerov all accused Russia of dragging its feet over a ceasefire. Healey said it had been more than a month since Russia rejected a US-backed peace settlement. Pistorius said Russia was still not interested in peace. Talks in Europe took place as US special envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia, once more, to press the Kremlin to accept a truce. Witkoff met Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Friday as Donald Trump urged the Russian president to ""get moving"" on a ceasefire in Ukraine. Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin and Witkoff would discuss the Ukraine war, but one should not expect any ""breakthroughs"". On the ground in Ukraine, Russia's defence ministry said on Thursday that its forces had captured the village of Zhuravka, in Ukraine's northern border region of Sumy. Ukrainian officials are yet to confirm this. Earlier this week, President Zelensky said as many as 67,000 Russian soldiers were positioned north of the border of the Sumy region, in preparation for an attack on the city of Sumy.",Ukraine allies pledge €21bn in fresh military aid,"Jonathan Beale, Malu Cursino",BBC News,2025-04-11T09:24:19,2025-04-11T13:22:53,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2025/04/11/the-clock-is-ticking-for-iran-00287080,"President DONALD TRUMP set a 60-day deadline for Iran to make progress on talks over its nuclear program or face potential military retaliation, according to four people familiar with the matter. The deadline, set out in Trump’s letter to Iran’s leader, sets the stakes for a high-profile meeting between the president’s top Middle East envoy, STEVE WITKOFF, and Iran’s foreign minister, ABBAS ARAGHCHI, in Oman on Saturday. It’ll be the first significant talks between Washington and its arch Middle Eastern rival since Trump took office. But some Israeli officials and GOP Iran hawks in Congress privately fear that these negotiations could play into Tehran’s favor, though few will openly criticize the president’s diplomatic efforts. That’s according to one current and one former Israeli official, as well as two GOP congressional aides and a former senior U.S. official familiar with the matter. We granted some of them anonymity as they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about sensitive diplomatic negotiations. They fear both Iran using the talks as a delaying tactic to rebuild its forces — or the prospect of Trump agreeing to a bad deal for the sake of clinching a quick diplomatic win. At the moment, Iran is reeling from Israel’s onslaught against its main proxy militant groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, and direct Israeli attacks on Iran’s military facilities late last year. From Iran’s perspective, “this is about intentionally wasting time it will use to advance its nuclear program and get in better standing with the international community,” said JONATHAN PANIKOFF, a former career senior U.S. intelligence officer who is now a Middle East security analyst at the Atlantic Council. “If this negotiation goes on and on, … what will we do? We have a window of opportunity that Iran is weak,” said JACOB NAGEL, a former head of Israel’s National Security Council now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. Nagel said he feared Trump would agree to a quick deal, even if it’s bad, for the optics. “Another check mark in his Nobel prize list and he will go to the next problem in the world,” Nagel said. Iran is reportedly open to an interim agreement on its nuclear program before pursuing talks on a more comprehensive agreement, as Axios reports today. Witkoff, in a newly published interview with The Wall Street Journal, signaled he was going into the talks open to allowing Iran to continue its nuclear program — so long as Tehran doesn’t weaponize it. “Where our red line will be, there can’t be weaponization of your nuclear capability,” he said. DAN SHAPIRO, a former senior Pentagon official and ambassador to Israel, said Iran could retaliate if the U.S. or Israel takes military action. “They have cards, and they’re playing them to try to steer the negotiations toward an outcome that they can live with,” said Shapiro. A spokesperson for Witkoff declined to comment. The National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment. Still, the 60-day deadline (which Trump outlined in his letter sent last month to Iran, according to four people familiar with the matter) could pressure Iran to move on a good deal. We also wanted to know, amid all this anxiety, what a good deal could possibly look like, particularly from Israel’s perspective. AMOS YADLIN, a former head of Israeli intelligence, told us: “It must include no sunset clauses, deal with the military dimension of the program, include much better inspections, include Iran entering into a 123 agreement and limit Iranian ballistic missiles — this is the minimum I think that will be considered as a deal that Israel could accept.” The Inbox WITKOFF’S OTHER MISSION: Before Witkoff heads to Oman for talks with Iran, he stopped in Moscow today and met with Russian leader VLADIMIR PUTIN. The meeting was the third between Trump’s envoy and Putin at the Kremlin as Washington pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump appears to be losing patience with Moscow, posting on Truth Social that “Russia has to get moving. Too many people are DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war.” LIBYA’S MAGA CHARM OFFENSIVE: ABDELKARIM MGEG, a Libyan nuclear scientist-turned-politician, this week courted top Republican politicians during a visit to Washington as he tries to become the United Nations-backed pick to be the next prime minister of the conflict-racked North African country, our Daniel Lippman writes in. In the last few days, he met with staffers of Senate Foreign Relations Chair JIM RISCH (R-Idaho) and Sens. JONI ERNST (R-Iowa) and KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-N.Y.), he said in a brief interview. And at the National Republican Congressional Committee president’s dinner Tuesday at the National Building Museum, he chatted with Speaker MIKE JOHNSON and former House Foreign Affairs Chair MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-Texas). Mgeg tailored his conversations to the MAGA vibes of Washington, making pitches on how the United States could help “make Libya great” and Libya could work together on getting more private investment into the country, as well as cooperate on security, energy and immigration. It’s an atypical strategy for getting Washington’s blessing. But Mgeg’s efforts come as Libya struggles to maintain political stability. The country is presently split in two, with separate governments in the west and east dueling for control of the whole country, with both sides courting more foreign engagement for international legitimacy. NEW ENEMIES OF MY ENEMY? China is increasing its outreach to countries hit hardest by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, in a sign that China may try to exploit the White House’s trade diatribes and peel away U.S. allies and partners. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson LIN JIAN also said that Chinese leader XI JINPING is going to Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia soon, on a conveniently timed trip that could help Beijing shore up its ties with some of Washington’s growing partners in the region. The U.S. has worked to deepen ties with Vietnam in recent years, and Malaysia and the U.S. have historically enjoyed a close diplomatic and security relationship. And China’s not just looking at its own neighborhood. Spanish Prime Minister PEDRO SÁNCHEZ was in Beijing today and met with Xi. That visit comes as China floats the idea of deeper European and Chinese trade partnerships to respond to Trump’s tariffs, as our colleague Aitor Hernández-Morales reports. That’s not the only trolling they’re doing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson MAO NING posted an image on X of a “Make America Great Again” hat with a “Made in China” sticker attached to it — and a pricetag increase of $50 to $77, a not-so-subtle reminder to the president that tariffs may increase prices on all goods manufactured in China. DRINKS WITH NATSEC DAILY: At the end of every long, hard week, we like to highlight how a prominent member of the national security scene prefers to unwind with a drink. Today, we’re featuring our new colleague Felicia Schwartz, who joined POLITICO this week from the Financial Times as our diplomatic correspondent and graciously stepped in to co-host today’s edition of your favorite newsletter. We had to ask how Felicia imbibes so that we could buy her a round of drinks for her troubles today. Felicia told us that her go-to drink is a Casamigos soda with a splash of lime juice, though she admits she’ll settle “for any blanco tequila whether I am roaming the embassies of D.C. or on the road following senior U.S. officials.” And it’s a tried and true drink for her, stretching from her adventures covering the U.N. General Assembly every year and her time based in Tel Aviv as a foreign correspondent. “I’ve found that simple, sugar-free cocktails are the secret to news gathering, or enjoyment, in the evenings, and then going back to work the next day without feeling completely dreadful,” Felicia says. Good advice for us all. Cheers, Felicia! IT’S FRIDAY! WELCOME TO THE WEEKEND: Thanks for tuning in to NatSec Daily!

His public debut is stirring more worries, based on keeping religion out of official day-to-day government work. In remarks this week to newly minted diplomats, Olowski referred numerous times to religion and God, according to a transcript obtained by our own Nahal Toosi. “To an officer of the United States like you and me, the Constitution is our commandment,” he said. “Its words are like the word of God and the words of the oath are our creation as officers. And these words are our beginning. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Olowski was clear, early in the remarks, that America protected the freedoms of nonbelievers as well as people of faith, saying the country’s commitment to religious liberty is “total.” But the text of his remarks has been circulating among diplomats, several of whom said they were uncomfortable with what they felt were overly religious overtones. NatSec Daily shared the transcript with spokespersons for the State Department as well as Olowski himself and asked for comment, but they did not reply. That’s not the only more explicit nod toward Christianity in Foggy Bottom. The State Department is telling staffers to report instances of “anti-Christian bias” within the workforce, part of an effort to implement a Trump administration executive order, according to a copy of a cable obtained by Robbie and Nahal. ANOTHER U.S. BROADCASTER BUCKLES: Middle East Broadcasting Networks Inc. will impose mass layoffs next week unless the Trump administration restores funding to the government-funded broadcaster. MBN was seen as a crucial tool to push back against propaganda in the Middle East put forward by U.S. adversaries like Iran and Russia. Those terminations follow ELON MUSK’s Department of Government Efficiency imposing a 30-day freeze on funding to MBN and other outlets supported by the Agency for Global Media, including Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe Liberty last month. The MBN terminations are a tactical move to allow the broadcaster time for legal challenges, MBN’s President JEFFREY GEDMIN told NatSec Daily. Keystrokes GROK GETS PROBED: Ireland is investigating whether Musk’s AI platform Grok was built using personal data from the X accounts of European citizens, our colleague Ellen O’Regan reports. In a statement, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission said it’d be investigating whether personal data “in publicly-accessible posts” on X was processed to train Grok, which could potentially violate the European Union’s data and transparency laws. The move, however, could stoke further tensions between Brussels and Washington, given Musk’s close relationship with Trump. The Complex GET YOUR ABACUS OUT: Defense budget watchers are scratching their heads at how the Trump administration will get towards its stated goal of a trillion dollar defense budget, our friends at Morning Defense reported this morning (for Pros!). Part of the confusion, per TODD HARRISON, an expert on defense budgeting who works at the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington, is that the administration has not specified whether Trump meant DOD (budget function 051) or broader national defense (050), which includes Energy Department nuclear programs. ICED OUT: The U.S. military just wished “farvel” to its top military in Greenland, our colleague Elena Giordano reports. Col. SUSANNAH MEYERS, commander of the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, was removed from her post after voicing dissent with Vice President JD VANCE’s visit to the Danish territory and support for U.S. annexation of the Arctic region. “I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the U.S. administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base,” Meyers wrote in an email to the base. Pentagon spokesperson SEAN PARNELL said Meyers was removed as “actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump’s agenda will not be tolerated.” Transitions — The Senate confirmed retired Lt.

https://apnews.com/article/explosion-hellenic-train-company-athens-882b4fc2d212577aa7ab5d3b1c66c1b9,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — A bomb planted near the offices of Hellenic Train, Greece’s main railway company, exploded Friday night in a busy district of central Athens, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries. The explosion comes amid widespread public anger over a 2023 railway disaster, Greece’s worst, in which 57 people were killed and dozens more injured when a freight train and a passenger train heading in opposite directions were accidentally put on the same track. Local media said a newspaper and a news website had received an anonymous call shortly before Friday’s blast, with the caller warning that a bomb had been planted outside the railway company offices and would explode within about 40 minutes. In a statement, Hellenic Train said the explosion had occurred “very close to its central offices” and said the blast had caused limited damage and no injuries to any employees or passers-by. It said authorities had acted immediately upon receiving information about the warning call, and that the company was cooperating fully with authorities and ensuring the safety of its staff. Police cordoned off the site along a major avenue in the Greek capital, keeping residents and tourists away from the building in an area with several bars and restaurants. Officers at the scene said a bag containing an explosive device had been placed near the Hellenic Train building on Syngrou Avenue. Police forensics experts wearing white coveralls were collecting evidence at the scene. Criticism over the government’s handling of the Feb. 28, 2023 collision at Tempe in northern Greece has mounted over the last few weeks in the wake of the second anniversary of the disaster, which killed mostly young people who had been returning to university classes after a public holiday. The crash exposed severe deficiencies in Greece’s railway system, including in safety systems, and has triggered mass protests - led by relatives of the victims - against the country’s conservative government. Critics accused authorities of failing to take political responsibility for the disaster or holding senior officials accountable. So far, only rail officials have been charged with any crimes. Several protests in recent weeks have turned violent, with demonstrators clashing with police. Earlier Friday, a heated debate in Parliament on the rail crash led to lawmakers voting to refer a former Cabinet minister to judicial authorities to be investigated over alleged violation of duty over his handling of the immediate aftermath of the accident. Hellenic Train said it “unreservedly condemns every form of violence and tension which are triggering a climate of toxicity that is undermining all progress.” Greece has a long history of politically-motivated violence dating back to the 1970s, with domestic extremist groups carrying out small-scale bombings which usually cause damage but rarely lead to injuries. While the groups most active in the 1980s and 1990s have been dismantled, new small groups have emerged. Last year, a man believed to have been trying to assemble a bomb was killed when the explosive device he was making exploded in a central Athens apartment. A woman inside the apartment was severely injured. The blast had prompted Minister of Citizen Protection Michalis Chrisochoidis to warn of an emerging new generation of domestic extremists.",A bomb strikes near the Athens offices of the Greek railway company.

https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-new-mexico-kansas-vaccine-e904ec9781f1d164c73afe4ab71774fe,"With one-fifth of states seeing active measles outbreaks, the U.S. is nearing 900 cases, according to figures posted Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s confirmed measles cases count is 884, triple the amount seen in all of 2024. The now three-month-long outbreak in Texas accounts for the vast majority of cases, with 663 confirmed as of Tuesday. The outbreak has also spread to New Mexico and Oklahoma. Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children died from measles-related illnesses in the epicenter in West Texas, and an adult in New Mexico who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness. Other states with active outbreaks — defined as three or more cases — include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. North America has two other ongoing outbreaks. One in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 1,020 cases from mid-October through Wednesday. And as of Tuesday, the Mexican state of Chihuahua state had 761 measles cases and one death, according to data from the state health ministry. The World Health Organization has said cases in Mexico are linked to the Texas outbreak. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000. As the virus takes hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates, health experts fear the virus that the spread could stretch on for a year. Here’s what else you need to know about measles in the U.S. How many measles cases are there in Texas and New Mexico? Texas state health officials said Tuesday there were 17 new cases of measles since Friday, bringing the total to 663 across 26 counties — most of them in West Texas. The state also added 23 hospitalizations to its count Tuesday saying they were from earlier in the outbreak, for a total of 87 hospitalizations.  State health officials estimated about 1% of cases — fewer than 10 — are actively infectious. Sixty percent of Texas’ cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 396 cases since late January — just over 1.5% of the county’s residents. The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Health officials in Texas said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February — Kennedy said age 6.  New Mexico announced one new case Friday, bringing the state’s total to 66. Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state’s cases are in Lea County. Three are in Eddy County and Chaves and Doña Ana counties have one each. State health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. New Mexico reported a measles-related death in an adult on March 6. How many cases are there in Indiana? Indiana confirmed two more cases April 21 in an outbreak that has sickened eight in Allen County in the northeast part of the state — five are unvaccinated minors and three are adults whose vaccination status is unknown. The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health said last week.  How many cases are there in Kansas? Kansas was steady last week with 37 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state. Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray and Morton counties have fewer than five cases each. Haskell County has the most with eight cases, Stevens County has seven, Kiowa County has six. The state’s first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas outbreak based on genetic testing.  How many cases are there in Michigan? Montcalm County, near Grand Rapids in western Michigan, has four linked measles cases. State health officials say the cases are tied to Canada’s large outbreak in Ontario. The state has nine confirmed measles cases as of Friday, but the remaining four are not part of the Montcalm County outbreak. How many cases are there in Montana? Montana state health officials announced five cases April 17 in unvaccinated children and adults who had traveled out of state, and confirmed it was an outbreak on Monday. All five are isolating at home in Gallatin County in the southwest part of the state. They are Montana’s first measles cases in 35 years. Health officials didn’t say whether the cases are linked to other outbreaks in North America. How many cases are there in Ohio? The Ohio Department of Health confirmed 32 measles cases in the state Thursday, and one hospitalization. The state count includes only Ohio residents. There are 16 cases in Ashtabula County near Cleveland, 14 in Knox County and one each in Allen and Holmes counties. Health officials in Knox County, in east-central Ohio, said there are a total of 20 people with measles, but seven of them do not live in the state.  How many cases are there in Oklahoma? Oklahoma added two cases Tuesday: 12 confirmed and three probable. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said. The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases, but Cleveland, Custer, Oklahoma and Sequoyah counties have had public exposures in the past couple of months. How many cases are there in Pennsylvania? There are eight measles cases in Erie County in far northwest Pennsylvania, officials said Friday. The county declared an outbreak in mid-April. The state said Friday it has 13 cases overall in 2025, including international travel-related cases in Montgomery County and one in Philadelphia.  How many cases are there in Tennessee? Tennessee has six measles cases as of Thursday. Health department spokesman Bill Christian said all cases are the middle part of the state, and that “at least three of these cases are linked to each other” but declined to specify further. The state also did not say whether the cases were linked to other outbreaks or when Tennessee’s outbreak started.  The state health department announced the state’s first measles case March 21, three more on April 1 and the last two on April 17, but none of the news releases declared an outbreak. Tennessee is on a list of outbreak states in a Thursday CDC report.  Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.? There have been 884 cases in 2025 as of Friday, according to the CDC. Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.  Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.  What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine? The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.  People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because most children back then had measles and now have “presumptive immunity.” In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”  But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. What are the symptoms of measles? Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash. The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. How can you treat measles? There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable. ___ AP Science Writer Laura Ungar contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The plan suggests a second successive EU-China summit would be held in the Chinese capital, despite the fact that the location is supposed to rotate. However, with Xi reluctant to make the trip to Brussels, it is understood that European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have accepted they must travel to Beijing if they want face time with the Chinese leader. No date has been confirmed with the Chinese side, but EU leaders’ willingness to make the trip indicates a serious effort to re-engage with Beijing at a time when the bloc’s relationship with the United States has effectively collapsed. US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House has seen him impose tariffs on EU goods, while he has performed a dramatic geopolitical volte-face on Ukraine, leaving Europeans to consider him on the side of the invading Russia in the three-year war.",Exclusive | EU leaders plan trip to Beijing in July for summit with Xi Jinping,Finbarr Bermingham,South China Morning Post,2025-04-11T01:38:08,2025-04-11T01:38:08,gemini-2.0-flash

Some of the victims had severe injuries, the sheriff said. He said the plane rolled and hit a tree. The crash caused a fuel spill that then caused a small fire. The crash happened around 4:30 p.m. Thursday. Fire rescue was actively working to extract the injured passengers as of 5 p.m. The victims will be taken to a hospital in Jacksonville, Phillips said.

https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-responding-helicopter-hudson-river/16153664/,"JERSEY CITY, New Jersey (WABC) -- Six people were killed after a tourist helicopter carrying a family from Spain crashed into New York City's Hudson River on Thursday afternoon. The crash was reported at 3:17 p.m. on the Jersey City side of the Hudson. Agustin Escobar, a Siemens executive from Barcelona, Spain, his wife Merce Camprubi Montal, and their children, ages 4, 5, and 11, were killed in the crash, law enforcement sources told ABC News. The pilot, who was 36, was also killed, making a total six people. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the helicopter was operated by New York Helicopters. The FAA believes the helicopter is a Bell 206 and appears to have taken off from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport at 2:59 p.m. It went up to the George Washington Bridge before turning back south along the Jersey side of the river. It went off radar at 3:25 p.m. Video shared with Eyewitness News appeared to show pieces of the helicopter break apart and crash into the water. Officials say the helicopter hit the water inverted, without a tail rotor or a main rotor blade. For witnesses, it turned out to be a memory full of horror. ""I watched it fall out of the sky! I heard five or six loud noises that sounded almost like gunshots in the sky and saw pieces fall off, then watched it fall into the river,"" said Dani Horbiak, who saw the crash from her apartment window. ""It sounded like a sonic boom on my right and so I look up and literally I see a helicopter splitting in two with the rotor flying off and this guy was going straight into the water and nothing came up afterwards,"" said a witness named Max. Officials say the entire flight lasted all of 15 minutes, before witnesses say it took an upside-down nosedive. ""It just kind of fell apart and it was the most terrifying thing that we ever witnessed,"" Rajany said. ""I heard some crackling, looked up and then just saw a plane falling apart,"" said witness Bruce Wall. ""And then maybe 15 feet in the air after the tail came off, broke off, and then the plane just sort of tumbled into the water with the propeller still in the air."" FDNY and NYPD divers were in the water almost immediately and assisted in the recovery. Four of the victims were declared dead at the scene and two victims were sent to local hospitals where they were pronounced dead. Jersey City Medical Center, where the passengers were transported after the crash, tried as hard as they could, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said. ""Our hearts go out to the family and those on board,"" Mayor Eric Adams said. A crane vessel hoisted the crumpled wreckage of the helicopter out of the Hudson and onto a barge Thursday night. Fulop said the main body of the aircraft has been recovered and is in the Army Corps of Engineers facility on Chapel Avenue, however major parts of the aircraft have still not been recovered. He says dive operations by the NYPD and NJSP will resume Friday morning. Police fished out chunks of jagged metal that washed up to the Jersey City shore, along with a life preserver, a seat and the personal effects of a family of five. The Spanish Consulate of New York City is now in touch with authorities to gather and confirm information and identification of the people involved in the helicopter crash, according to the communications team at the Spanish Foreign Ministry. The Jersey City Police Department is taking the lead on the investigation since the helicopter crashed on the Jersey City side of the river, Fulop said. Fulop said tours in the area are constant and fall within a busy and heavily trafficked area. He hopes this will increase the dialogue to decrease traffic. ""Hopefully this brings some more attention to it, that the fact beyond just noise, you have real safety concerns,"" Fulop said. The FAA says they are temporarily halting all operations around the Hudson River crash site. The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate the crash, and is expected to arrive on Thursday night. They will have to piece together what went wrong, and what caused the rotors to break apart, dooming the 21-year-old helicopter and the six people aboard. At least 32 people have died in helicopter crashes in NYC since 1977 -- most recently in 2019 when a helicopter used for executive travel hit the roof of Manhattan skyscraper in restricted airspace and the pilot was killed. ---------- * Get Eyewitness News Delivered * Follow us on YouTube * More local news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250410010100315,"SEOUL, April 11 (Yonhap) -- South Korea established diplomatic relations with Syria this week, the foreign ministry said Friday, a diplomatic milestone that completed Seoul's endeavors to have formal ties with every U.N. member state except North Korea. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul traveled to Damascus on Thursday (local time) to finalize the procedure and met with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani for talks on the development of bilateral relations, it said. Syria was the last U.N. member state with which South Korea did not have diplomatic ties. With the opening of the new ties, South Korea now has official relations with all 191 U.N. member states except North Korea. Additionally, South Korea has diplomatic ties with three non-U.N. members: the South Pacific island nations of the Cook Islands and Niue, and the Holy See. ""This development opens a new chapter of cooperation with Syria, whose bilateral relations with South Korea had been severed due to its close ties with North Korea,"" the ministry said in a release.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) During talks with Al-Shaibani, Cho expressed hope that bilateral cooperation will contribute to Syria's development and regional stability as South Korea is ready to share its experience in economic growth to back Syria's reconstruction process, the ministry said. Cho also discussed with his counterpart the possibility of South Korean companies participating in reconstruction efforts, as well as providing humanitarian assistance to the Arab nation, including medicine, medical equipment and rice. The Syrian minister expressed his gratitude for South Korea's offers while hoping that Seoul will support its bid to have sanctions on his country eased, the ministry said. Following the talks, Cho paid a courtesy call on Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. During the meeting, Cho noted that Syria's efforts to meet international expectations, such as undertaking an inclusive political process, taking a firm stance against extremism and eliminating chemical weapons, will help create an environment conducive to its reconstruction and sustainable economic development. The minister said that South Korea was willing to play a role in supporting the new Syrian government's efforts. In response, Al-Sharra hailed the formation of ties with South Korea, highlighting that South Korea's support is ""crucial for a new Syria embarking on a fresh start,"" and hoping for a ""friendly and cooperative relationship that contributes to international peace,"" according to Seoul's ministry.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) Since the launch of Syria's interim government in December, led by former rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, South Korea had been stepping up efforts to establish formal diplomatic ties with the Arab nation. A foreign ministry official paid a visit to Syria in early February and confirmed the interim government's willingness to pursue bilateral relations. The move to open diplomatic relations was approved at a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on March 18. The establishment of formal ties with Syria is expected to further expand South Korea's diplomatic reach, following its surprise announcement in New York in February last year to forge relations with Cuba. Seoul's ties with Havana dealt a blow to Pyongyang, Cuba's Cold War-era ally, which has long touted its ""brotherly"" relationship with the socialist Caribbean state. Syria has maintained ties with North Korea since establishing diplomatic relations in 1966. In December, Syria's rebel fighters overthrew the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, bringing an end to half a century of dictatorship by the Assad family. Al-Sharaa has since been named president for the transitional period. elly@yna.co.kr(END)",S.

The court's ruling immediately reinstated Park nearly four months after he was impeached by the National Assembly on charges of aiding and abetting Yoon before and after his surprise declaration of martial law on Dec. 3. ""There is no evidence or objective material to back allegations that he aided the president's declaration of martial law by implied or tacit agreement,"" the court said in delivering its unanimous verdict. Park was accused of not opposing the former president during a Cabinet meeting held immediately before his martial law announcement. He was also alleged to have planned the government's response at a presidential safe house following parliament's reversal of the decree and prepared a detention facility for lawmakers while the order was in force. ""Simply because he held a meeting at the presidential safe house after the martial law was lifted, the defendant cannot be said to have been involved in an act of insurrection through discussions on legal follow-up measures for the act of insurrection or a consideration of response measures,"" the court said. Park had denied the charges, saying he actively sought to dissuade Yoon from declaring martial law and did not discuss follow-up measures during the gathering at the presidential safe house. hague@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) Constitutional Court rejects justice minister's impeachment over martial law involvement,Lee Haye-ah,Yonhap News Agency,2025-04-10T15:06:01,2025-04-10T15:06:01,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250410010351320?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, April 10 (Yonhap) -- Unification Minister Kim Yung-ho said Thursday the key to addressing North Korea's provocations and nuclear ambitions lies in the unified goals and coordinated actions of the international community. Kim made the remarks during a press conference in Tokyo, where he reaffirmed Seoul's commitment to achieving the complete denuclearization of North Korea, enhancing international cooperation and strengthening extended deterrence through the South Korea-U.S. alliance. ""The complete denuclearization of North Korea may seem like an unattainable goal, but a path forward will open if the international community joins hands,"" Kim said, noting that the Donald Trump administration also pursued the objective. Though China and Russia have not taken a firm stance on sanctions against Pyongyang, Kim pointed out that both countries share a desire for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula so they are unlikely to oppose reunification or efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Asked about his view on calls from some for South Korea's independent nuclear armament, Kim made it clear that the government is not considering the development of its own nuclear weapons and remains committed to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Kim is in Japan for a three-day visit through Friday, which aims at enhancing two-way cooperation on inter-Korean unification issues and the North Korea policy under Japan's Shigeru Ishiba administration. During his meeting with Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, Kim exchanged views on the security situation in North Korea and reaffirmed the importance of close cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo, as well as trilateral coordination involving the United States, according to Japan's Kyodo News. Kim also reiterated the South Korean government's support for the immediate resolution of the issue of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea, it added. Kim held separate talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, during which he called for maintaining close bilateral ties and building a future-oriented cooperative relationship to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula and around the world. Iwaya emphasized that relations between the two neighboring countries are crucial in today's strategic environment, according to the report. graceoh@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) Unification minister says united global response key to deterring N.K. provocations,Oh Seok-min,Yonhap News Agency,2025-04-10T21:52:21,2025-04-10T21:52:21,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250410003751315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, April 10 (Yonhap) -- Former President Yoon Suk Yeol is set to leave the presidential residence Friday to return to his private residence in southern Seoul, officials said Thursday, following his removal from office last week.

 Yoon plans to leave the official residence at 5 p.m. Friday move to his private residence, a senior presidential official said in a press notice.

 The Presidential Security Service (PSS) has reportedly completed organizing a private residence security team of about 40 people for Yoon. Under the current law, Yoon can receive protection from the PSS for up to 10 years.

 Yoon's private residence is located at the Acrovista apartment complex in Seocho-dong, southern Seoul, and he previously stayed there for six months even after his presidential inauguration in May 2022.

 Yoon and his wife, Kim Keon Hee, are reportedly considering moving to another private residence in the capital area later because they own as many as 11 pet dogs and cats and the presence of security guards may cause some inconveniences for neighbors.

https://apnews.com/article/sudan-war-uae-icj-genocide-convention-rsf-857a66e660bf9ea8417e8e32c097e7c8,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The United Arab Emirates argued at the UN’s top court on Thursday that it has no jurisdiction to rule on a claim of genocide lodged by Sudan. The UAE told the judges at the International Court of Justice that the allegations the country is breaching the genocide convention by arming and funding the rebel paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces were a misuse of the institution. Sudan wants The Hague-based court to issue emergency orders, known as provisional measures, including telling the UAE to do all it can to prevent the killing and other crimes targeting the Masalit people. “The idea that the UAE is somehow the driver of this reprehensible conflict in Sudan could not be further from the truth,” said Reem Ketait, a senior official at the UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She described the case as “the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE.” Both Sudan and the UAE are signatories to the 1948 genocide convention. The United Arab Emirates, however, has a caveat to part of the treaty which legal experts say makes it unlikely that the case will proceed. “The ICJ has previously said that this kind of reservation is allowed and is a barrier to a case going forward. The court is most likely to say the same thing in this case, meaning that this case will not go forward,” Melanie O’Brien, an associate professor of international law at the University of Western Australia and an expert on the convention, told The Associated Press. Sudan descended into a deadly conflict in mid-April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary rebels broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions. Both the Rapid Support Forces and Sudan’s military have been accused of abuses. The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and a U.S. ally, has been repeatedly accused of arming the RSF, something it has strenuously denied despite evidence to the contrary. Conflict Observatory, a monitoring group which is funded by the U.S. State Department, has identified aircraft it says carried UAE arms transfers to the RSF. Those flights went through Maréchal Idriss Deby international airport in Amdjarass, Chad. The UAE says the purpose of the flights was to support a local hospital. In January, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, also known as Hemedti, had been targeted for sanctions along with seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates. That came as the U.S. declared the RSF rebels are committing genocide. The war has killed more than 24,000 people and driven over 14 million people — about 30% of the population — from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries. The Sudanese Armed Forces have broadly retaken Khartoum from the RSF. Last month, the military said it had recaptured Khartoum’s international airport.",UAE rejects Sudan's claim at UN court that it is breaching genocide convention by funding rebels,Molly Quell,AP News,2025-04-10T06:26:41,2025-04-10T08:26:47,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-force-coalition-britain-france-nato-4c87525361eb3cf1c860075d4519f6d8,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Britain’s defense minister on Thursday urged his counterparts from around 30 countries to press ahead with plans to deploy troops to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia, as questions remained over whether the United States would provide backup. Chairing the first meeting of the so-called coalition of the willing at the level of defense ministers, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said its members must ensure “that we’re fully prepared for the moment a peace agreement is reached.” “We must be ready for when that peace comes. That’s why the work of this coalition is so vital,” Healey said at NATO headquarters in Brussels. He added that 200 military planners have been developing plans to deepen European involvement in Ukraine. In a post on social media, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that “Ukraine is ready for peace — one that is just and backed by strength.” Ukrainian government officials and military analysts have said that Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in Ukraine in the coming weeks to maximize pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin’s negotiating position in ceasefire talks. As usual with coalition gatherings, the United States did not take part. The success of the coalition’s operation hinges on U.S. backup with airpower or other military assistance, but the Trump administration has made no public commitment to provide support. The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland underlined the “crucial” role of the United States. “The United States is a crucial player still in guaranteeing lasting security” in Ukraine, said Finnish Defense Minister Annit Häkkänen. His Swedish counterpart, Pål Jonson, said success in Ukraine requires “some form of U.S. engagement” while Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans called American support “very important” but said the form it took might differ, depending on the chosen type of European mission in Ukraine. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said ministers were “trying to keep the United States on board.” Amid that uncertainty and U.S. warnings that Europe must take care of its own security and that of Ukraine in future, the force is seen as a first test of the continent’s willingness to defend itself and its interests. Its make-up will depend on the nature of any peace agreement, but the contingent is unlikely to be stationed at Ukraine’s border with Russia. It would be located farther from the ceasefire line, perhaps even outside Ukraine, and deploy to counter any Russian attack. Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent is proving a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops. Healey said the “reassurance force for Ukraine would be a committed and credible security arrangement to ensure that any negotiated peace does bring what President Trump has pledged: a lasting peace for Ukraine.” But some countries are reluctant to contribute personnel without U.S. support. The Europeans cannot match U.S. weapons systems, intelligence gathering and satellite surveillance capabilities. More fundamentally, members of the coalition are still trying to establish how the force would operate: Leading countries want a robust deterrence force to defend against any Russian attack. Brekelmans said key questions must be answered like “what is the potential mission? What is going to be the goal? What is the mandate? What would we do in different scenarios, for example, if there would be any escalation regarding Russia?” Some countries — Italy and the Netherlands, for example — require the approval of their national parliaments before they can deploy troops. On Friday, representatives from around 50 nations will gather at NATO to drum up military support for Ukraine. That meeting will be chaired by Britain and Germany.

https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2025/04/09/iran-open-to-us-investment-but-rejects-regime-change-attempts-says-pezeshkian,"President Masoud Pezeshkian said Wednesday Iran has no objection to American investors doing business in the country but the country firmly opposes any attempts at regime change or foreign interference. “The leader has no objection to the presence of American investors in the country,” Pezeshkian said of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, in a speech broadcast on state television. “We oppose their flawed policies, such as conspiracies and attempts at regime change.” For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app. Iran has had no diplomatic relations with Washington since 1980, but is set to hold nuclear talks with US officials in Oman on Saturday. The talks follow a letter sent by US President Donald Trump on March 7, urging Khamenei to resume nuclear negotiations and warning of possible military action if Iran refuses. Tehran responded weeks later, saying it was open to indirect negotiations and dismissed the possibility of direct talks as long as the United States maintains its “maximum pressure” policy. “The leader said that we are ready to negotiate, but not in direct negotiations because we do not trust them,” Pezeshkian said. Iran has long viewed Washington as being behind attempts to interfere in and destabilize its government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution which toppled the US-backed Pahlavi dynasty. Ties have remained frozen ever since, with any contacts made via the Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents American interests in the country, or through intermediaries such as Oman. In December 2024, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said attempts at regime change in Iran “have not exactly been resounding successes.” Since returning to the White House for a second term in January, Trump has reinstated his “maximum pressure” sanctions policy against Iran. During his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sweeping economic sanctions. Tehran adhered to the 2015 deal for a year after Washington withdrew from it, but later began rolling back its own commitments. After signing the accord in 2015, Khamenei said the United States had sought “to use these negotiations and this agreement to find a way to infiltrate the country.” “We have closed this path and we will close it decisively,” he said. “We will not allow American economic infiltration into our country, nor their political infiltration, nor their political presence, nor their cultural infiltration.” Read more: Iran FM warns Trump against ‘military option’ ahead of nuclear talks Iran skeptical over coming US talks, Iranian officials say Iran says deal can be reached if US shows goodwill","Iran open to US investment but rejects regime change attempts, says Pezeshkian",AFP,Al Arabiya English,2025-04-09T06:59:00,2025-04-09T06:59:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.timesofisrael.com/macron-says-france-could-recognize-a-palestinian-state-in-june/,"France plans to recognize a Palestinian state within months and could make the move at a UN conference in New York in June on settling the Israel-Palestinian conflict, French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday. “We must take the path of recognition [of the Palestinian state]. So that’s what we’re gonna do in the coming months,” Macron, who just returned from a trip to Egypt during which he visited the Gaza border, told France 5 television. Israel’s foreign minister denounced the idea as being a “reward for terrorism.” Macron indicated that the move could come at a June United Nations conference co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia on creating a Palestinian state. “Our aim is to chair this conference with Saudi Arabia in June, where we could finalize this movement of mutual recognition [of a Palestinian state] by several parties,” he added. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories “I won’t do it for unity or in order to please someone,” Macron continued. “I’ll do it because I think that at some point it would be fair. And also because I want to take part in a collective dynamic, one that allows everyone who defends Palestine to also recognize Israel.” Such recognition would allow France “to be clear in our fight against those who deny Israel’s right to exist — which is the case with Iran — and to commit ourselves to collective security in the region,” he added. He argued the move will serve regional security, a claim rejected by Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, who said it will have the opposite effect. “‘Unilateral recognition’ of an imaginary Palestinian state by any state in the reality familiar to us all will be nothing but a reward for terrorism and a strengthening of Hamas,” Sa’ar wrote on X. “Things like this will not only not bring peace, security, and stability closer to our region — but on the contrary: They will push them further away.” Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar speaks at the Israeli embassy in France after his meeting with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, April 3, 2025, in Paris. (AP Garriga) France’s recognition of Palestinian statehood “would be a step in the right direction in line with safeguarding the rights of the Palestinian people and the two-state solution,” Palestinian Authority Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Varsen Aghabekian Shahin told AFP. In Egypt this week, Macron held summit talks with President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II. He also took part in a joint phone call alongside the leaders with	US President Donald Trump, urging an end to the war in Gaza. France has long championed a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, including after the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023. But formal recognition by Paris of a Palestinian state would mark a major policy switch and risk antagonizing Israel, which insists such moves by foreign states are premature. Israel has argued that unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state now will be viewed as a reward for Hamas’s October 7 onslaught. Israel’s military campaign to rid the Gaza Strip of Hamas has sparked worldwide sympathy for Palestinians and galvanized support for recognizing statehood in some capitals. Last year Spain, Norway, Ireland and Slovenia all recognized a Palestinian state, provoking fury from Israel. In August, the Foreign Ministry announced that it would revoke the diplomatic accreditation of eight Norwegian diplomats based in Tel Aviv who dealt with the Palestinian Authority. Germany and Portugal both said the time was not right for recognition. In Britain, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, before the elections that saw him win office, said he wanted to recognize a Palestinian state if he won power, but that such a move would need to come at the right time in a peace process.",Macron says France could recognize a Palestinian state in June,"Lazar Berman, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-04-09T20:55:58,2025-04-09T20:55:58,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/african-union-israel-ambassador-evicted-rwanda-genocide-f22033810dc019bd632deed7bb9fab25,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — Israel ’s ambassador to Ethiopia was ejected from an African Union event this week and has described it as outrageous. An Israeli official on Wednesday told The Associated Press the ejection from the annual event commemorating the 1994 Rwanda genocide was at the request of AU Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Youssouf. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to a journalist. “The new African Union Commission chairperson chose to introduce anti-Israel political elements,” the ambassador, Avraham Nigusse, asserted Tuesday on social media. It “reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the histories of both the Rwandan and Jewish peoples,” he added, saying he had been invited by Rwanda. The spokesperson for Youssouf, a former foreign minister of Djibouti, did not respond to requests for comment. Youssouf started his four-year AU term in February. A diplomat at the AU on Wednesday said Israel’s ambassador was removed because they no longer had observer status at the continental body based in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalists. Israel regained observer status at the AU in 2021, two decades after it was revoked over its conflict with the Palestinians, as Jerusalem sought wider ties with African nations. However, the observer status was suspended again in 2023 pending review by a committee of African heads of state. They have yet to deliver a verdict. In 2023, a senior Israeli diplomat was evicted from the AU’s annual summit for not having proper accreditation. The pan-African body has strong ties to the Palestinians, often inviting their leaders to address major gatherings. Israel last month shattered a ceasefire and renewed its military offensive in Gaza. The territory’s Health Ministry says more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war with Hamas started with the militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. South Africa, a prominent AU member, has brought a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide during its military operations in Gaza.

https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-panama-ports-hutchison-audit-393722d9e86ddc6554a4aab661cef3e6,"HONG KONG (AP) — A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate that is embroiled in U.S.-China tensions over its Panama Canal port assets denied allegations Wednesday that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country. Panama’s comptroller authority announced on Monday that an audit of Panama Ports Company found irregularities in the renewal of a 25-year port concession in the interoceanic canal. The authority’s accusations came the same day as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s arrival in the country to participate in a security conference. The Panama Ports Company, or PPC, defended itself in a statement Wednesday, saying it had made significant investments that exceeded $1.69 billion, surpassing the $50 million investment required under the original concession contract signed in 1997. That was also more than another $1 billion agreed to in an addendum. It said the investments were confirmed by the country’s comptroller general in 2020 after a thorough audit. The company said any statement about what it should have paid under the original concession contract must take into account the respective addenda, which was validly executed and approved by law. “To express the opposite, as it unfortunately has been the case, not only distorts the reality of the existing legal relationship between PPC and the State under the concession contract and its addenda, but also contradicts the State’s own acts over the years,” it said, referring to Panama. It said any claim that the company has failed to pay about $1.2 billion to Panama is false and that it believes “respect for legal certainty gives companies and investors the certainty that Panama is a safe country in which to invest.” Panama Ports Company, under Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings, won a concession to operate the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, beginning in 1997 and it was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. CK Hutchison is controlled by the family of Li Ka-shing, the southern Chinese city’s richest man. U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged Chinese interference with the critical shipping lane’s operations — accusations that Panamanian authorities have denied. Hegseth said Tuesday that the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation. Last month, CK Hutchison announced a tentative deal to sell its canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., which pleased Trump but angered Beijing. China’s Hong Kong affairs offices have posted scathing commentaries from a local state-backed media outlet over the tentative deal. Chinese anti-monopoly authorities said they would review the business agreement, a state-backed news outlet reported last month. It is unclear how the geopolitical pressure might affect the deal. But analysts have warned that a cancellation could cause the Trump administration to impose more sanctions or restrictions on businesses and individuals in Hong Kong and mainland China.",Hong Kong company denies that it failed to pay Panama under a contract to operate its canal ports,KANIS LEUNG,AP News,2025-04-09T15:55:08,2025-04-09T11:55:08,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/russian-minister-guilty-of-british-sanction-violations-b42f71d284ad2d92ce3b011c27ec0138,"LONDON (AP) — A former Russian government minister became the first person Wednesday to be convicted in the U.K. of circumventing sanctions put in place after the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, who was appointed governor of Sevastopol in Crimea by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2016, used a British bank account to illegally receive tens of thousands of pounds from his wife and accepted gifts and payments from his brother, prosecutors said. Ovsiannikov, who also served as deputy minister for industry and trade, was an important political figure placed under European Union sanctions in 2017 for work that threatened the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, prosecutors said. The sanctions were adopted in the U.K. in 2019 as it left the E.U. “He knew he had been on the U.K. sanctions list since 2017 but chose to ignore this,” said Julius Capon of the Crown Prosecution Service. “Another member of his family sought deliberately to breach the sanctions to live their own lavish lifestyle and showed complete disregard for the law.” Ovsiannikov, 48, was convicted in Southwark Crown Court of six out of seven counts of circumventing sanctions between February 2023 and January 2024. The jury couldn’t reach a verdict on the final count. He was also convicted of possessing and using criminal property. His brother, Alexei Owsjanikow, 47, was convicted Wednesday of two counts of circumventing sanctions for paying school tuition for Ovsiannikov’s children. He was found not guilty of three additional counts of breaching sanctions for buying his brother a Mercedes-Benz worth 54,500 pounds ($70,000) and giving him access to a bank account. Ekaterina Ovsiannikova, 47, was cleared of four counts of circumventing sanctions for allegedly funneling 76,000 pounds ($97,000) to her husband. Lawyers had argued the brother and wife didn’t know Ovsiannikov faced sanctions or were unaware he couldn’t receive financial assistance. All three are Russian nationals, though Ovsiannikov and his brother have British passports because their father was born in England. The CPS said the case was the first prosecution for breaching sanctions put in place by the U.K. in 2019. “Mr. Ovsiannikov thought he could hide from our sanctions,” Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said in a statement. “We are resolutely committed to increasing pressure on Putin, his cronies, and all those who aid his barbaric war in Ukraine.” Ovsiannikov and his brother will be sentenced at a later date.",Former Russian minister convicted in UK for violating British sanctions,Brian Melley,AP News,2025-04-09T19:33:53,2025-04-09T15:33:53,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/thailand-monarchy-us-scholar-defamation-military-c8943d59d9158737860a54aab0e1f3f1,"BANGKOK (AP) — A U.S scholar teaching in Thailand who was jailed on charges of insulting the country’s monarchy — an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison — was released on bail on Wednesday, but also had his visa revoked, an indication he could be deported soon. An appeals court granted Paul Chambers’ release on bail after it was twice denied on Tuesday by a lower court, said the advocacy group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. No trial date has been set. However, since immigration police earlier on Wednesday revoked his visa, Chambers could be deported home to the United States at any time. He has the right to appeal the visa revocation within 48 hours, according to police Maj. Gen. Sarawut Khonyai. Chambers was first jailed on Tuesday pending trial following a complaint by the Thai army that he had insulted the nation’s monarchy, an offense also known as “112” after its article number in the criminal code. He has been working as a lecturer at Naresuan University in Thailand’s northern province of Phitsanulok, The U.S. State Department said in a statement Tuesday that it was alarmed by Chamber’s arrest and urged “Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.” A 58-year-old Oklahoma native with a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, Chambers has studied the Thai military, which has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago. The charge against him was related to a webinar he took part in last October, organized by the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore. His defenders say he had nothing to do with what was quoted in the charge sheet. He was also charged with violating the Computer Crime Act, covering online activities. Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate of the Thai lawyers’ group said Chambers’ visa was revoked on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking. Thai law calls for 3-15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere.

https://apnews.com/article/shipping-emissions-climate-change-25de476e26d3a2abd642bdfd49430d1f,"Nations are trying to reach an agreement to charge commercial vessels a fee for their emissions in what would effectively be the world’s first global carbon tax. The International Maritime Organization, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely. Its Marine Environment Protection Committee meets Monday through Friday in London. The committee, comprised of IMO member states, is working to approve proposed new global regulations to put a price on maritime greenhouse gas emissions and to set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The measures are more than climate aspirations – they will become mandatory for ships operating globally, said IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, who thinks the industry must do more to cut carbon pollution. The committee will “set the course for a net-zero future for the maritime sector,” he told The Associated Press in a statement Thursday. The future of clean shipping hangs in the balance, said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green. Fenton said a high price, simple flat-rate levy on shipping’s greenhouse gas emissions is the only way to decarbonize the industry equitably. “If an agreement is reached, it would represent a huge moment of solidarity in the fight to tackle climate change,” Fenton said. “For the first time, we will have, hopefully, an effective global framework tackling this international issue. Most emissions are tackled domestically.” Here’s what to know: Emissions from shipping have increased over the last decade — to about 3% of the global total according to the United Nations — as vessels have gotten much bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fuel oil. Maritime nations agreed in 2023 to slash emissions from the shipping industry, though several experts and nations were critical of the deal since it did not set 2050 as a hard date. The IMO is now in the process of adopting regulations to achieve the goals agreed to in 2023. A simple climate levy paired with a green fuel standard would help narrow the price gap between fossil fuels and green fuels, such as hydrogen, methanol and ammonia, according to the Global Maritime Forum, a nonprofit that works closely with the industry. Shipping relies heavily on fossil fuels and the sector won’t transition off those on its own, said Jesse Fahnestock, who leads the forum’s decarbonization work. And it will take time to build up a supply of e-fuels based on renewable electricity so investments need to happen now, he added. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil, releasing carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned. Dominguez has said that major decarbonizing requires an overhaul of shipping fuel. The Clean Shipping Coalition is calling on governments to commit to a high price on all ship emissions and a strong fuel standard. The alliance of environmental non-profits is also urging countries to revise the IMO’s tool for measuring a ship’s carbon intensity, to quantify and raise their efficiency transparently and drive down the amount of fuel burned long-term. Led by Pacific island nations, whose very existence is threatened by climate change, more than 60 countries support a flat levy per metric ton of emissions to reach net zero in a fair way. The shipping industry supports a fee, too. The International Chamber of Shipping represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet. Its secretary general, Guy Platten, said a pricing mechanism for maritime emissions is a pragmatic solution and the most effective way to incentivize a rapid energy transition in shipping. Some countries, notably China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, want a credit trading model instead of a fixed levy, where ships get credits for staying under their emissions target and ships purchase credits if they go over. Other countries want a compromise between the two models. Some fear that anything short of a universal levy would jeopardize climate goals and allow wealthier ship owners to buy compliance while continuing to pollute. Ambassador Albon Ishoda, Marshall Islands’ special envoy for maritime decarbonization, said IMO’s climate targets are “meaningless” without the levy. Revenue from a levy could be used to help developing countries transition to greener shipping, so they aren’t left behind with dirty fuels and old ships. If the committee agrees and finalizes text for the regulations, they could be formally adopted in October and take effect in 2027. That could send a powerful signal that the green transition is happening and that it’s possible for a global industry, according to the IMO. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

https://apnews.com/article/serbia-media-eu-monitoring-group-fe82dda84c8b06676b9d43ad69336ef3,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Press freedom in Serbia has reached a “critical” situation, with attacks and threats against journalists on the rise amid massive anti-government protests, an international media monitoring group said on Wednesday. “We came here because we observed an unprecedented crisis for media in Serbia,” Jasmijn de Zeeuw, from the Free Press Unlimited group, said. De Zeeuw, who was part of a Media Freedom Rapid Response, or MFRR, delegation visiting Serbia this week, urged a response from the European Union. Serbia is formally seeking EU membership, but populist President Aleksandar Vucic has faced accusations of stifling democratic freedoms, including the freedom of the press. De Zeeuw said attacks on journalists in Serbia have doubled compared to a year ago, while 56 incidents have occurred in response to the media coverage of a Nov. 1 train station tragedy in Serbia’s north that killed 16 people and the protests that followed. “The instances we recorded include physical attacks, threats, including severe death threats, online smear campaigns, raids of offices without search warrants and blockades of journalists and media.” de Zeeuw said. “We are strongly disturbed by the number of violations against press,” she added. Last week, Reporters Without Borders issued a similar verdict, saying: “Serbian journalism is being systematically repressed yet European political leaders remain locked in a state of guilty inaction.” The MFRR, which is co-funded by the EU, tracks, monitors and reacts to violations of press and media freedom in EU member states and candidate countries. There was no immediate reaction from the Serbian government to the findings. The government’s Information Ministry earlier this week expressed “concern” that the MFRR mission will not be objective and impartial and was “selective” in choosing whom to meet. Jamie Wiseman, an advocacy officer with the International Press Institute, said Serbia ranks among the countries in Europe to have the highest confirmed use of spyware against journalists, who face increasing legal lawsuits filed by senior officials and public figures. “These are clearly aimed at supressing legitimate public interest journalism on important matters,” Wiseman warned. Vucic’s government has stepped up pressure aimed at quelling the protests. He has called protesting university students “terrorists,” while Serbian media reported at least two foreign citizens have been ordered to leave the country over protest support. Speaking in Paris on Wednesday, Vucic criticized the private United Media group which owns N1 and Nova television stations that have extensively covered the demonstrations. The company is a “platform for conducting violence in Serbia,” Vucic said on Instagram. David Diaz-Jogeix, senior director of programs at the Article 19 organization, which campaign for freedom of expression, said that MFRR recommendations include a request to the EU to freeze an accession dialogue with Serbia and issue a public condemnation of the attacks and threats on journalists. Diaz-Jogeix urged “the Serbian authorities, but in particular we call on the President of Serbia, to cease all public attacks on journalists and media, including those covering protests.” The EU, he said, “needs to speak up.” “They cannot be business as usual,” Diaz-Jogeix warned.","Serbian press freedom faces 'critical' situation, media monitoring group warns",Jovana Gec,AP News,2025-04-09T15:56:50,2025-04-09T11:56:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-europe-trump-2c4f1519373803ac1f7c1744b69812d0,"BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union member states voted Wednesday to approve retaliatory tariffs on $23 billion in goods in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as the largest U.S. trading partner described them as “unjustified and damaging.” The tariffs will go into effect in stages, with some on April 15 and others on May 15 and Dec. 1. The EU executive commission didn’t immediately provide a list of the goods. Members of the 27-country bloc repeated their preference for a negotiated deal to settle trade issues. “The EU considers U.S. tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy,” the EU’s executive commission said in a statement. “The EU has stated its clear preference to find negotiated outcomes with the U.S., which would be balanced and mutually beneficial.” The targeted goods are a tiny fraction of the 1.6 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion) in U.S.-EU annual trade, which sees some 4.4 billion euros in goods and services cross the Atlantic each day in what the European Commission calls “the most important commercial relationship in the world.” The head of the EU’s executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has offered Trump a zero-for-zero tariffs deal on industrial goods including cars. But Trump has said that’s not enough to satisfy U.S. concerns. Trump’s expanded steel and aluminum tariffs came into effect in March. The EU has targeted smaller lists of goods in hopes of exerting political pressure and avoiding economic damage from a wider escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs. The EU is also working on a response to Trump’s blanket 20% tariff on all European goods, imposed as part of his sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on global trading partners. That could include measures aimed at U.S. tech companies and the services sector as well as trade in goods. France’s Economic Minister Eric Lombard said the second package “will take account not only of European imports, but also of other ways in which we can respond.” Speaking to legislators in the National Assembly in Paris, Lombard added that “the idea is that, with these extremely strong, extremely powerful measures, we can get to the negotiating table on an equal footing, so that both sides of these duties can be lowered and all our economic sectors protected.”","EU imposes new tariffs on $23 billion in US goods in retaliation for Trump's steel, aluminum tariffs","LORNE COOK, DAVID MCHUGH",AP News,2025-04-09T10:05:08,2025-04-09T11:20:19,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-849483,"Sebastián Basso, the lead prosecutor in the AMIA bombing case, has requested a national and international arrest warrant against Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei due to his direct involvement in the bombing of the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994, according to Argentinian daily Clarín on Wednesday. In 1994, the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina Jewish community center was bombed, killing 85 and wounding 300. Hezbollah is believed to be behind the attack, with Iranian backing and support. According to Basso, Khamenei “led the decision to carry out a bomb attack in Buenos Aires in July 1994 and issued executive order (fatwa) 39 to carry it out.” JPost Videos Basso requested of Argentinian Federal Judge Daniel Rafecas that Khamenei “be called to give a statement in relation to his involvement in the attack on the AMIA headquarters on July 18, 1994, along with the other Iranian suspects mentioned in this report.” Khamenei “sponsored an armed organization that operates clandestinely outside of Lebanese territory and is linked to the Hezbollah movement, which for decades has carried out numerous attacks on the lives and property of people that must be clarified as terrorist acts, including the AMIA attack,” Basso stated. Basso requested that Interpol be notified “for the purpose of executing the arrest.” He also ordered Argentina’s federal security forces to arrest Khamenei if he steps on Argentinian soil. Clarín noted that this represents a shift from the position of previous prosecutors and intelligence agents, who saw Khamenei as having immunity due to his official role. Khamenei’s immunity was based on a doctrine of par in parem non habet imperium, which means that equals have no jurisdiction over each other, thereby reinforcing the principle of the sovereign equality of states. This principle holds that one state cannot exercise its powers over, or interfere in, the lawful activities of another foreign state, Basso argued in the document obtained by Clarín. “In this context,” he added, “it is important to stress that the principle of immunity not only covers activities carried out by the state itself but also acts committed by high-ranking officials: heads of state, diplomatic and consular officers, foreign ministers, and other ministers on official overseas missions.” According to Basso, “It’s essential to clearly distinguish between the principle of state immunity, head of state immunity, and the immunities of diplomatic agents, consular officers, and certain cabinet members. It’s also important to note the sources of this principle, which has historically been governed by customary international law. However, as these distinct immunities evolved, conventional regulation emerged in certain cases. “In this regard, Article 27 of the Rome Statute establishes that no form of immunity can be invoked before the International Criminal Court, and its second section emphasizes the distinction between domestic and international immunities,” Basso said. Khamenei served as Iranian President from 1981 to 1989 before succeeding RuhollahKhomeinias Supreme Leader in 1989.

https://apnews.com/article/china-africa-gambia-malawi-taiwan-diplomacy-pressure-306aafddf26aae9ecccd5b8d7e5ff509,"BEIJING (AP) — Chinese diplomats threatened to cancel a summit and called top officials in two African countries to pressure lawmakers to quit an international parliamentary group critical of China, officials from the group told The Associated Press. It’s an example of how far China will go to influence politicians overseas, and how that pressure can succeed behind closed doors. In the past year, lawmakers from Malawi and Gambia withdrew from the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, or IPAC, a group of hundreds of lawmakers from 38 countries concerned about how democracies approach Beijing, according to letters, messages and voice recordings obtained by The Associated Press. Founded in 2020, the group has coordinated sanctions on China over rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and rallied support for Taiwan, a self-ruled democratic island Beijing claims as its territory. African politicians and experts say it’s an escalation of Chinese diplomatic pressure in Africa, where Beijing’s influence is growing. Beijing has built deep ties with African leaders by developing mines and building infrastructure through state-owned construction companies, often funded by loans from state-owned banks. The pressure is also part of Beijing’s longstanding effort to influence groups and lawmakers across the world, including in New York state, where a former governor’s aide faces charges for acting as an agent for the Chinese government. ‘Very shocking news’ In January, Gambian lawmaker Abdoulie Ceesay sent a voice message to an IPAC staffer saying the Chinese government had complained to the Gambian foreign ministry about his membership. “We have very shocking news … it’s a problem right now,” Ceesay said in the recording, which IPAC provided to AP. “The president is not happy with us at all.” Later the same month, Ceesay and fellow lawmaker Amadou Camara informed the alliance they were withdrawing. Ceesay told IPAC in a written message that his decision was “not influenced by the Chinese embassy,” a position Ceesay reiterated when contacted by AP. Gambia’s information minister said he was unaware of any attempt by China to influence his country’s politicians. “They decided on their own behalf to opt out of IPAC after realizing it goes against the government’s bilateral (relationship) with China,” said the minister, Ismaila Ceesay, who is not related to Abdoulie Ceesay. The Chinese government has targeted lawmakers over the alliance before. Beijing has sanctioned some members and last year, lawmakers from at least six countries were pressured by Chinese diplomats not to attend the group’s summit in Taiwan. Kenyan lawmakers cancelled their plans to attend but stayed in the alliance. The group was also targeted by Chinese state-sponsored hackers in 2021, according to a U.S. indictment. “Foreign legislators are being bullied out of a free alliance between them and other politicians,” said IPAC head Luke de Pulford. “This is clearly a result of Chinese pressure.” In a statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused IPAC of “smearing China” and said that “China has never engaged in coercive diplomacy.” But a Malawian lawmaker, Ephraim Abel Kayembe, told an IPAC staffer he had been contacted by the speaker of the Malawian National Assembly shortly after he and another lawmaker joined the group at last year’s Taiwan summit, according to the staffer. The staffer declined to be named for fear of damage to their relations with other politicians. Have a news tip? Contact AP’s global investigative team at investigative@ap.org. For secure and confidential communications, use the free Signal app +1 (202) 281-8604. The speaker told Kayembe the Chinese government had threatened to cancel the president’s upcoming visit to Beijing for a regional summit and meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, according to IPAC head de Pulford, programs director Tom Fraser and the person who spoke directly to Kayembe. Less than two weeks after the summit, the two Malawian lawmakers said they were withdrawing. Kayembe said in a letter to IPAC that he had been tricked into joining. “I want to extend my sincere apology to the People’s Republic of China,” Kayembe wrote in the Aug. 7 letter. When contacted by AP, Kayembe denied being coerced by the Malawi or Chinese governments, writing in an email that he withdrew because the alliance appeared “aimed at achieving geopolitical intentions against China.” Malawi’s government did not respond to a request for comment. Shifting alliances For decades, Beijing has cultivated ties with African governments, seeking diplomatic partners and access to natural resources. Many African leaders have welcomed Beijing’s presence since it brings much-needed capital and construction expertise that can contribute to economic growth and development. Critics say China strikes secretive, sometimes corrupt deals with African leaders that mainly benefit Chinese companies and workers brought in to build mines, bridges and railways. “China has been investing and being present in African countries when many countries were not willing to come,” said Christian-Geraud Neema, Africa editor of the China Global South Project, an independent research group. Chinese leaders have repeatedly promised not to interfere in the internal affairs of African countries, saying there are “no political strings attached” to its investment. But China has pressured African governments to shun Taiwan or Tibet’s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, efforts that Neema says appear to be escalating. Last October, South Africa demanded that Taipei move its unofficial embassy out of the administrative capital, Pretoria, and in January, Beijing sanctioned the head of South Africa’s second-largest political party for visiting Taiwan. Moves like these mirror efforts China has made against governments elsewhere in the past. Beijing blocked exports from Lithuania, for example, after the northern European country allowed Taiwan to open a trade office. But experts say the pressure against the IPAC members is unusual. Lina Benabdallah, a professor at Wake Forest University who studies China’s relations with Africa, said she has never heard of China using direct coercion against African parliamentarians before. “This is very new to me,” Benabdallah said. Zimbabwe lawmaker and IPAC member Daniel Molokele said he expects to see more coercive behavior from Beijing, especially as the Trump administration pulls back from Africa. “I expect China to benefit,” Molokele said. “It will definitely use this opportunity to grow its influence in Africa.” ___ Abdoulie John in Serrekunda, Gambia, and Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa, contributed to this report.",Beijing ups diplomatic pressure on Africa as the US pulls back,Dake Kang,AP News,2025-04-09T05:27:15,2025-04-09T01:27:15,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-china-soldiers-donetsk-captured-05a412aba1cfe13b623b2403db5db533,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine on Wednesday expanded on its claim that significant numbers of Chinese nationals are fighting for Russia’s invading army, saying it had gathered detailed intelligence on more than 150 mercenaries Moscow allegedly recruited through social media. In China, officials called the allegations “totally unfounded.” The Ukrainian accusation and Chinese denial come as the U.S. strives to secure a ceasefire in the more than three-year war. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced Tuesday that the Ukrainian military had captured two Chinese men fighting alongside the Russian army on Ukrainian soil. It was the first time Ukraine had made such a claim about Chinese fighters in the war. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said he was willing to exchange the two prisoners of war for Ukrainian soldiers held captive in Russia. Without providing evidence, Zelenskyy said officials in Beijing were aware of Russia’s campaign to recruit Chinese mercenaries. He stopped short of saying the Chinese government authorized the mercenaries’ involvement in Ukraine. Zelenskyy said Ukraine has the last names and passport data for 155 Chinese citizens fighting for the Russian army and that “we believe that there are many more of them.” He shared with journalists documents listing names, passport numbers and personal details of the alleged Chinese recruits, including when they arrived in Russia for military training and departed for service; the AP has not independently verified the documents. China has provided strong diplomatic support for Russia since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has also sold Russia machinery and microelectronics that it can use to make weapons, Western officials say, in addition to providing an economic lifeline through the trade in energy and consumer goods. China is not believed to have knowingly provided Russia with troops, weapons or military expertise. U.S. officials have accused Iran of providing Russia with drones, while American and South Korean officials say North Korea has sent thousands of troops and ammunition to help Russia on the battlefield. With the U.S. and Europe having provided substantial military support and diplomatic heft for Ukraine, the war has to some degree become a contest between power blocs. Tensions between the U.S. and China have deepened in recent years. Disputes have centered on geopolitical influence, technology and trade — and recently escalating import tariffs between the countries have roiled global financial markets. Zelenskyy said U.S. officials expressed “surprise” when informed of the presence of Chinese mercenaries in Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to follow through on a campaign promise last year to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said at a briefing in Washington on Tuesday that reports of Chinese citizens fighting on behalf of Russia were “disturbing.” “China is a major enabler of Russia in the war in Ukraine,” Bruce said. China provides nearly 80% of the dual-use items Russia needs to sustain the war, she claimed. But Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said he is “not convinced yet” the Chinese personnel identified as fighting on behalf of Russia against Ukraine are more than mercenaries or volunteers. “There’s an axiom in the military, the first report is always wrong,” Kellogg said during a Wednesday appearance at Georgetown University. “And this is one of those let’s sit back and see how this plays out, because it could be volunteers.” Kellogg noted that Ukraine also has volunteers from other countries, including the United States, fighting on its behalf. He added that the early reports of Chinese personnel are not on par with North Korea’s deployment of thousands of troops to the frontlines. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, also called Beijing “the key enabler of Russia’s war.” Dual-use goods are entering Russia via China, she said in Brussels, adding “it’s clear that if China would want to really stop the support then it would have an impact.” China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for the war, according to a U.S. assessment last year. The Kremlin has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting in Ukraine. The Kyiv government has consented to it. Both sides are believed to be readying spring-summer military campaigns. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in Beijing that China has played a “constructive role in politically resolving the Ukraine crisis.” Lin told a daily news briefing Wednesday that “the Chinese government always asks Chinese citizens to stay away from conflict zones, avoid getting involved in any form of armed conflict, and especially refrain from participating in any party’s military operations.” His comments appeared to indicate that the captured Chinese had joined Russia’s ranks on their own initiative. Both Russia and Ukraine allow foreign soldiers to enlist. China has previously put forward a vague peace plan that was swiftly dismissed by most observers. In the meantime, both countries have kept fighting a war of attrition along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and targeted each other with long-range strikes. The city of Kramatorsk in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk endured a “massive drone attack” overnight, regional head Vadym Filashkin said, injuring an 11-year-old girl, her mother and her grandmother. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 55 Shahed and decoy drones at the country overnight. The Russian Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 158 Ukrainian drones over 11 Russian regions overnight but reported no casualties or damage. Several Russian regions temporarily suspended flights at their airports because of the attack, however, and some Ukrainian drones reached Russia’s Orenburg region in the southern Urals located nearly 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) east of the Ukrainian border, the Defense Ministry said. ___ AP reporters Christopher Bodeen in Taipei, Taiwan, Lorne Cook in Brussels, and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at ",Zelenskyy says more than 150 Chinese mercenaries are fighting for Russia in Ukraine,SAMYA KULLAB,AP News,2025-04-09T09:18:56,2025-04-09T18:42:59,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/germany-merz-new-government-coalition-merz-berlin-591d8dfc11836e282ca8871ff41d0ffa,"BERLIN (AP) — German election winner Friedrich Merz sealed a deal Wednesday to form a new government that aims to spur economic growth, ramp up defense spending, take a tougher approach to migration and catch up on long-neglected modernization. The agreement paves the way for new leadership in the 27-nation European Union’s most populous member, which has Europe’s biggest economy. It follows months of political drift and weeks of negotiations as the continent faces uncertainty over the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs and its commitment to European allies’ defense. Merz is on track to become Germany’s new leader in early May, replacing outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The 69-year-old’s two-party Union bloc emerged as the strongest force from Germany’s election on Feb. 23. Merz turned to the Social Democrats, Scholz’s center-left party, to put together a coalition with a parliamentary majority. 




‘Germany is back on track’ Before Merz can take the helm, the coalition deal needs approval in a ballot of the Social Democrats’ membership and by a convention on April 28 of Merz’s Christian Democratic Union party. Once those hurdles are cleared, the lower house of parliament — in which the allies have 328 of the 630 seats — can elect him as chancellor. Merz said the deal is “a very strong and clear signal to the people of our country, and also a clear signal to our partners in the European Union: Germany is getting a government that is capable of acting and will act strongly.” Asked about his message to the U.S. president, Merz replied: “The key message to Donald Trump is, Germany is back on track. Germany will fulfill the obligations in terms of defense and Germany is willing to strengthen their own competitiveness.” He added, “We will bring the European Union forward.” The prospective coalition embarked on one big project before even reaching a deal to govern together. Last month, it pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt, and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that’s aimed at boosting the stagnant economy. That was an about-turn for Merz, whose party had spoken out against running up new debt before the election without entirely closing the door to future changes to Germany’s self-imposed “debt brake.”


Economy and migration Other measures in the agreement are more in line with what he campaigned for. The coalition aims to boost companies’ investment and then cut corporate tax, make working overtime more attractive and cut electricity tax. Merz, the opposition leader at the time, made reducing migration central to his election campaign. On Wednesday, he said the new government will suspend family reunions for many migrants, designate more “safe countries of origin,” launch a “return offensive” for rejected asylum-seekers and turn some people back at Germany’s borders in consultation with neighbors. It will also tighten a law passed by the outgoing government that eased the rules for gaining citizenship, scrapping the possibility for well-integrated applicants to get a German passport after three rather than five years of residence. 


Throw out the fax machines The new government will include a “digitization ministry” to modernize a country that still has a reputation for tangled bureaucracy and old-fashioned paperwork. “Not everything has to be regulated down to the smallest detail,” said the Social Democrats’ co-leader, Lars Klingbeil. “The diggers must work and the fax machines in our country must be thrown away. Our economy must grow.” Merz said the coalition plans to reduce the size of the federal administration by 8% over its four-year term. But, referring to the United States’ Department of Government Efficiency, he said it doesn’t plan to do so by firing workers. “We’re not hiring an Elon Musk here who will do it like they do in Washington,” he said. “We will do it ... sensibly, with a sense of proportion.”


Pressure from abroad and at home The election took place seven months earlier than planned after Scholz’s unpopular coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting and widespread discontent. Germany, the 27-nation European Union’s most populous member, has been in political limbo since then. The market turbulence caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs added to pressure for Merz’s Union and the Social Democrats to bring their coalition talks to a conclusion. The tariffs threaten to add to the woes of an export-heavy economy that shrank for the past two years.
 Another factor in the haste to reach an agreement was a decline for the Union in the opinion polls, showing support slipping from its election showing, while the far-right Alternative for Germany, which finished a strong second in February, gained as the political vacuum persisted. “The political center in our country is in a position to solve the problems we face,” Merz said. Ministers will be named at a later date.",German parties agree to form a new government after months of drift in Europe’s biggest economy,GEIR MOULSON,AP News,2025-04-09T10:10:25,2025-04-09T11:19:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250409001000315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, April 9 (Yonhap) -- The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has denounced a recent pledge by South Korea, the United States and Japan to denuclearize Pyongyang, calling it the ""most hostile act"" and saying it won't change the country's possession of nuclear weapons. Kim Yo-jong, vice department director of the ruling party's central committee, issued the statement Wednesday in response to the outcome of last week's trilateral meeting of the three countries' foreign ministers. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearizing North Korea on the margins of a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) last Thursday. Kim claimed the joint pledge only revealed the uneasiness of the three countries about addressing North Korea's denuclearization, saying they know it is only ""a daydream that can never come true."" ""If they frantically cry out for 'denuclearization,' really believing in it, they must be termed nonsensical,"" she noted in the statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). North Korea's status as ""a nuclear weapons state"" is ""a result of the inevitable option which accurately reflected the hostile threat from outside and the change in the present and future world security mechanical structure,"" she also claimed. ""So it does not change no matter how desperately anyone denies."" For North Korea, discussing the dismantlement of its nuclear weapons or reviving the ""dead concept of denuclearization"" only constitutes ""the most hostile act of denying"" its sovereignty and attempting to force it ""to renounce its constitution and social system,"" according to Kim. ""If the U.S. and its vassal forces continue to insist on anachronistic 'denuclearization' while talking about 'threat' from someone, it will only give unlimited justness and justification to the advance"" of North Korea's pursuit of the ""strongest nuclear force for self-defense,"" she added. The latest remarks mark Kim's first reported public statement in a month following her March 3 condemnation of the USS Carl Vinson, a Nimitz-class U.S. aircraft carrier, entering a naval base in South Korea's southeastern city of Busan. pbr@yna.co.kr(END)",N.K. leader's sister slams S.

The strikes hit around Hodeida’s al-Hawak District, the rebels say. The area is home to the city’s airport, which the rebels have used in the past to target shipping in the Red Sea. Since its start, the intense campaign of US airstrikes targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters — related to the Israel-Hamas war — has killed at least 75 people, according to casualty figures released by the Houthis. Footage aired by the rebels’ al-Masirah satellite news channel shows chaotic scenes of people carrying wounded to waiting ambulances and rescuers searching by the light of their mobile phones. The target appears in the footage to be a home in a residential neighborhood, likely part of a wider decapitation campaign launched by the Trump administration to kill rebel leaders. Other strikes target Yemen’s mountainous Amran governorate, north of the rebel-held capital of Sanaa. There, the Houthis describe American strikes hitting telecommunication equipment. Previous US strikes also targeted telecommunications gear in Amran near Jebel Aswad, or the “Black Mountain.” The US military’s Central Command, which oversees American military operations, doesn’t immediately acknowledge the strikes.

https://www.thetimes.com/world/middle-east/article/iran-arming-proxy-forces-iraq-long-range-missiles-5wpdx0w82?msockid=3a66ed9bf9b764691eb8f8e6f84c655f,"Iran has transferred long-range missiles to its proxy forces in Iraq for the first time, increasing the regime’s military footprint in the region even as President Trump threatens to hold Tehran accountable for the actions of its militia. The Times has learnt that Tehran has been bulking up its presence in the region by supplying a new batch of weapons to powerful Shia militias in Iraq, dashing hopes that Iran would withdraw support as it prepares to enter negotiations with the United States over its missile and nuclear programme. The weapons were transferred last week, according to regional intelligence involved in monitoring the nearly 1,000-mile border between the countries. It was the first time long-range surface-to-surface missiles had been in the possession of an Iran-allied militia in Iraq. Sources said the delivery was arranged by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Air Force. Iran is set to head into the first official negotiations over its nuclear programme with the United States since President Trump scrapped the Obama nuclear accord in 2018. Iran has widely been viewed as greatly weakened in recent years, having lost air defences around nuclear sites after a confrontation with Israel in October and with the fall of its proxies — Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — and the toppling of the Assad regime in Syria. Speaking to Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump urged Tehran to agree a deal during the negotiations, which were expected to take place in Oman. “If the talks aren’t successful, I actually think it’ll be a very bad day for Iran,” he said. However, sources said that two other types of missiles, the Quds 351 cruise and Jamal 69 ballistic missiles, were also smuggled into Iraq last week. They had a much shorter range than the new surface-to-surface missiles, which could be positioned to target as far as Europe. “Iran has recently transferred missiles to Shia militias in Iraq, including new models with longer range, which have not been given in the past to those militias. It’s a desperate move by the Iranians, risking the stability of Iraq,” a regional intelligence source said. The Houthi rebel group in Yemen and the Iran-allied militias in Iraq are seen as the last forces fighting on behalf of the regime in Iran. The US has been striking key Houthi targets in the past few weeks, on Tuesday killing a senior intelligence leader, Abdul Nasser al-Kamali. Iraq has its own separatist armed groups allied with Iran, which can be traced back to the rule of Saddam Hussein and have a staunchly anti-American stance, particularly since the US invasion of 2003, where they launched deadly attacks. In January last year, the militia group Kataib Hezbollah killed three American military personnel in Jordan. The US retaliated with a drone strike that killed its leader, Abu Baqir al-Saadi, leading the group to suspend attacks to prevent “embarrassment” to the Iraqi government. • Iran warns neighbours not to help US if it attacks The Iraqi government, which still hosts American forces, has clamped down on terror groups including Islamic State, leading Iran-allied militia to hunker down under pressure first from Washington, which has bolstered forces across the region before any potential confrontation, and also from the Islamic Republic itself, which has warned neighbouring states that any compliance with the US, including allowing the use of their airspace, will be held to account. The development runs contrary to reports this week from Iraqi officials and senior commanders who said that the Iranian-backed militia in Iraq was “prepared to disarm” to avert potential conflict with America. One senior Shia politician close to the Iraqi government told Reuters the groups were intending to comply with US calls to disarm to avoid being targeted. “The factions are not acting stubbornly or insisting on continuing in their current form,” Izzat al-Shahbndar said, adding that discussions between the prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and several militia leaders were “very advanced”. Soon after the comments were made public, an Iraqi political source told the Saudi-owned media organisation Al Arabiya that the armed factions had in fact refused to disarm. “The efforts seen in the last 48 hours to create a picture that the militias are disarming is a ruse,” a diplomatic source in the region told The Times. “The Iraqi militia knows what it is doing and is concerned about internal Iraqi opposition. There are discussions in Iraq, among politicians but also in the public sphere on social media, against importing Iran’s problems to their home turf. They look at Lebanon and are actively trying to avoid that.” • Iran has every incentive to make a nuclear deal with Trump Analysts said Iran was “scrambling” to regain its foothold in the Middle East, leading its remaining proxies to try to hedge their bets. “Some of the militia leaders have been in talks with the Iraqi government about demilitarising their struggle and joining the political process. I think some proxies are losing faith in Iran to support them in the long term,” William Alberque, a visiting fellow at the Stimson Centre, said. On the other hand, he added, it made sense that Iran would “escalate its support to the militias to try to convince them to break off talks and continue fighting”. He said: “However, it is also possible that they will pocket the assistance and use it as leverage in negotiations rather than continue a longer-term and very costly and dangerous fight. “Iran has no reason to give up its proxy tool, as it continues to reap benefits, both in destabilisation, but also because this creates opportunities for Iran through ungoverned spaces — including organised crime and other smuggling vectors.”",Iran defies Trump by arming proxy forces in Iraq with missiles,Gabrielle Weiniger,The Times,2025-04-08T11:45:58,2025-04-09T04:55:13,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9281ljxj0o,"South Sudan has said it will now allow the entry of a man deported from the US, in a dramatic climb down aimed at defusing a visa row between the two countries. On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US would be revoking US visas for all South Sudanese. He said it was a response to South Sudan's refusal to accept the return of its citizens being removed from the US. In its initial reaction, South Sudan's foreign ministry said the move was based on a case involving someone who had been incorrectly identified as South Sudanese and was sent back as a result. The government now says it will allow the man to enter the country ""in the spirit of the friendly relations"". It adds that the deported man, identified as being from the Democratic Republic of Congo, could arrive in the capital, Juba, as early as Wednesday. ""As a result of this decision, the government has instructed the relevant authorities at Juba International Airport to facilitate [his] arrival,"" South Sudan's foreign ministry said in Tuesday's statement. Referring to other possible removals, the ministry said the country was committed to supporting the return of its ""verified nationals"" who are scheduled for deportation from the US. The US move at the weekend was the first time the US targeted all passport holders from a particular country since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, having campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, with the promise of ""mass deportations"". In his statement on Saturday, Rubio said that the US would also block any arriving citizens of South Sudan, the world's newest country, at US ports of entry. He blamed ""the failure of South Sudan's transitional government to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner"". ""We will be prepared to review these actions when South Sudan is in full cooperation,"" he added. But in a statement on Monday, South Sudan's foreign ministry said it ""deeply regrets"" the blanket measure against all of the country's citizens based on ""an isolated incident involving misrepresentation by an individual who is not a South Sudanese national"". It said the man at the centre of the visa row was a Congolese national and he was returned to the US. It added that all supporting evidence was shared with American officials. But Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau dismissed South Sudan's explanation as ""legally irrelevant"", saying the African country's embassy in Washington ""certified this particular individual as one of their nationals"". ""It is unacceptable and irresponsible for South Sudanese government officials to second guess the determination of their own embassy,"" Landau added. South Sudan's Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told the AP news agency that the US was ""attempting to find faults with the tense situation"" in the country because no sovereign nation would accept foreign deportees. This row comes as fears grow that South Sudan may again descend into civil war after the country's First Vice-President Riek Machar had been placed under house arrest. South Sudan's President Salva Kiir accused Machar of stirring up a new revolt. Last month, the US ordered all its non-emergency staff in South Sudan to leave as fighting broke out in one part of the country, threatening a fragile peace deal agreed in 2018 that ended a five-year civil war. South Sudanese in the US were previously granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allowed them to remain in the US for a set period of time.

https://www.politico.eu/article/friedrich-merz-germany-christian-democratic-union-social-democratic-party-coalition-talks/,"BERLIN — Friedrich Merz has yet to begin his chancellorship, but he’s already feeling the heat. The incoming leader is facing slumping approval ratings and a barrage of criticism from parts of his conservative base who believe he is yielding to the will of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) during coalition talks. Merz’s critics say he is failing to make good on pre-election vows to move his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) sharply to the right in key policy areas. The dissent within the ranks has spilled out into the open in recent days after members of the conservative bloc’s youth organization in the city of Cologne wrote a letter to Merz venting their dismay. “Mr. Merz, we believed in your political leadership. We trusted you. And we have fought for you,” the letter read. “But we are now asking the question: for what? For a CDU that submits to the left-wing mainstream?” After years of weak, divided government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, many European leaders had hoped Merz would provide stronger German leadership within the European Union. Merz too has vowed to provide that leadership in light of the challenges posed by U.S. President Donald Trump, vowing after his victory in the Feb. 23 snap election “to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA.” But Merz’s recent political difficulties have left him injured, a weakened leader who may have to spend more time attempting to repair his damaged image at home. Already Germany’s conservative bloc is dropping in the polls while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) — set to become Germany’s biggest opposition party when the new Bundestag convenes — is benefiting from the incoming chancellor’s new vulnerability. Germany’s latest benchmark Deutschlandtrend poll shows support for Merz’s conservative bloc dropping three percentage points to 26 percent and the AfD gaining by the same margin to reach 24 percent support, its strongest-ever result. Perhaps even more concerning for Merz, only 25 percent of Germans approve of his performance, down 10 percentage points from February, when the conservatives won the national election. Merz’s recent political problems began when he reached a historic agreement with the SPD and the Greens to unleash as much as €1 trillion in new spending for defense and infrastructure over the next decade, including €100 billion for Germany’s green transition. While Germany’s dramatic move to reverse more than 15 years
of self-imposed austerity drew approval abroad, many domestic conservatives quietly smarted, believing that Merz —
who had preached a conservative gospel of fiscal discipline ahead of the election — had given his center-left opponents the debt-fueled spending they’d long advocated. The move also opened him up to fierce attacks from the AfD, whose leaders accused Merz of betraying his own voters. “What do you actually stand for, Mr. Merz?” one of the AfD’s leaders, Tino Chrupalla, asked in parliament. “By now, you have the mRNA of the SPD implanted in you.”
Germany ‘will suffer massive damage’
Much of the criticism of Merz is coming from his conservative bloc’s youth organization, the Young Union. Johannes Winkel, the chair of the organization who also also sits on the CDU board, threatened to vote against a coalition agreement with the SPD that doesn’t deliver on core conservative policies. He demanded a crackdown on migration and the restoration of economic competitiveness by cutting regulation and bureaucracy. “If we enter into a coalition without the overdue and promised policy change, the country will suffer massive damage,” he said in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung daily.

The youth organization in Cologne demanded that Merz follow through on his pre-election pledges to reject asylum seekers at the border, reject tax increases, and institute “a massive reduction” in bureaucracy, all policies the SPD has resisted to varying degrees. “If this course is not corrected immediately, you will not only jeopardize the CDU’s profile — you will destroy the trust of the people and the commitment of its members,” the conservative youth wrote. The problem for Merz, however, is that he doesn’t have much leverage to force the SPD to bend to the will of conservatives. His massive spending plan has already given the SPD much of what it wanted, and having ruled out an alliance with the AfD, he has no other viable coalition partner. In recent days Merz has been trying to placate his dissatisfied base, addressing their core concerns as Trump’s tariffs wreak havoc in Europe and beyond. “The situation on the international equity and bond markets is dramatic and threatens to get worse,” Merz told Reuters. “It’s more important than ever for Germany to restore its competitiveness.

The National Election Commission began early candidate registration shortly after the Constitutional Court dismissed Yoon last Friday. If the schedule is confirmed, candidates will be required to register by May 11 and the official campaign period will kick off on May 12. The law also requires a public servant running for president to resign at least 30 days before an election, making May 4 the deadline for their run.

https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-sabotage-undersea-cables-baltic-sea-europe-war/,"Suspicious Russian tankers keep slashing Europe's internet and power cables.Â
It's not an act of war â
¦ but someday it might be. Before Russia bulldozed its way into Ukraine, Ilja Iljin mainly hunted for people stranded at sea. Now, he also hunts saboteurs.Â
Iljin, a deputy commander of Finland’s coast guard, is increasingly on the lookout for tankers about to commit sabotage. Behind him is a small army: dozens of radars and cameras, numerous patrol boats, a fleet of planes and helicopters â
all deployed to scour a stretch of water as large as Belgium.Â
They’re looking for suspicious behavior that could imperil the undersea cables that bring internet and power to Europeans.Â
And yet, sabotage keeps happening — twice in the Gulf of Finland alone in the last 18 months, according to Iljin. In total, the Baltic Sea has registered at least six suspected sabotage incidents since 2022, with 11 known undersea cables taken out since 2023.
“This is becoming more common,” Iljin said, standing in the cabin of the 23-meter-long patrol vessel, waves chopping against its sides. “We have become more aware of the risk, and we’re currently trying to figure out ways for how to properly respond.”
The damage hasn’t disrupted society. The lights stayed on; the Wi-Fi still worked. But they still sent a chill through Europe: What if the next vigilantes were more coordinated, more severe? What if Russia was launching an assault on Europe? What if it meant war?Â
A tumultuous scenario is not hard to envision. Ireland could lose a 10th of its electricity via three cable cuts. Norway feeds the European Union a third of the bloc’s gas through underwater pipelines. Going after either target could wreak chaos —Â
energy shortages, runaway prices, forced choices over who loses power.
“We are witnessing … [a] new reality,” said Lithuanian Energy Minister Å½ygimantas VaiÄ
diÅ«nas. “We have more and more incidents in the Baltic Sea, which could have an impact for markets, for consumers and also for our businesses.”
So far, authorities have failed to conclusively show Moscow was behind any of the incidents. But “such sabotage activities in the current circumstances could be seen as useful for Russia … that’s the only interpretation,” VaiÄ
diÅ«nas told POLITICO.
For Russia, the drumbeat of even minimal damage helps feed Western insecurity —Â
and plant the idea that, true or not, Moscow could upend Europeans’ daily life if it wanted.
Europe’s waters, in other words, have become a new front in the warming Cold War with Russia.
The EU and NATO are racing to tackle the problem, rolling out plans to buy spare cables and drones and beef up military surveillance. But Donald Trump is sparking fears that the situation will only get worse, as the United States’ president trashes America’s core alliances and parrots Russian talking points.
“They’ve been emboldened,” said one EU diplomat, who was granted anonymity to speak freely. “So it just means that we have to get serious.”
Finding cracks
The EU faced its first rude awakening in late 2022.Â
In September of that year, the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream pipelines were mysteriously blown up. Reports have since linked the incident to Ukrainian nationals, though the criminal case is ongoing.
Since then, Baltic Sea sabotage has proliferated, hitting telecom, gas and power links connecting Sweden, Finland, Germany, Latvia and Estonia. Just a few weeks ago, a communications cable linking Berlin and Helsinki was again damaged off the Swedish coast.Â
It’s a simple operation to pull off.Â
To start, the costs are extraordinarily low. “Potentially, it’s just bribing a captain to lower the anchor,” said Christian Bueger, an international relations professor and maritime security expert at the University of Copenhagen. “That’s really cheap if you’re thinking about military-style, security operations.”Â
The target is also easily within reach of a ship’s anchor. The Baltic Sea is only 52 meters deep on average, while the Gulf of Finland is even shallower at 38 meters. Compare that to the Mediterranean Sea at 1,500 meters.
Then, the cables themselves are simple to cut.Â
Subsea data cables —Â
which carry the world’s emails, WhatsApps and Zoom meetings — are minuscule, roughly an arm’s thickness wide and weighing just 3 kilograms, according to Volker Wendt, secretary-general of the Europacable trade body.Â
Underwater power connections —Â
which link both countries and offshore wind turbines — are made to withstand the harsh subsea environment. They’re about as wide as a guitar, protected by layers of insulation and steel and weigh up to 65 kilograms, Wendt said.Â
The cables, buried half a meter under the seafloor, are built to last 40 years and withstand trawling from fishnets —Â
but not an anchor’s direct hit. That’s exactly what happened with the Eagle S, a vessel that dragged its anchor 100 kilometers until it cut several cables near Finland in December.
Once severed, repairs are challenging, according to Bueger, the maritime expert.Â
Repair ships “are relatively limited globally,” he said, with only around 80 available worldwide. And even after arriving on site, fixes can take up to two weeks for data cables and “many months” for power cables, according to Peter Jamieson, vice chair of the European Subsea Cables Association.Â
The price tag? Between €5 million and €150 million, according to Bueger.
That’s a lot of money and time for something that’s essentially impossible to stop. Around 15 percent of the world’s total sea traffic moves through the Baltic Sea, which stretches almost 400,000 square kilometers — larger than Germany. Hordes of drones, radars and sailors can’t catch every rogue agent.
“It’s impossible to be everywhere at the same time,” said Marko Laaksonen, deputy chief of staff of operations in Finland’s navy.Â
So far, Western intelligence suggests some of the incidents were, in fact, accidental. But experts have raised doubts about others, especially where Russia’s allies are involved, such as the Chinese-registered Yi Peng 3 tanker that severed two undersea cables last November.Â
Either way, Moscow loves to exploit uncertainty, according to Nick Childs, a maritime defense expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.
“In a situation in which you’re not actually at war, there is the plausible deniability,” he said. “Russia may be seeking to raise its game in … the gray zone below actual conflict, as a kind of deterrent and warning signal to Western governments, not to escalate their support for Ukraine.”
It’s the same tactic Moscow uses elsewhere. Western officials suspect Russia’s hand in arson attacks and parcel bombs sent across Europe, as well as mounting disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks. Just last month, a Belarusian man was accused of setting fire to a Polish supermarket on Russia’s behalf. All low-level violence with some degree of deniability.
Officials are now adding undersea sabotage to that list.
“What we’re seeing is clearly an escalation,” said Bueger, and “a strategic attempt to undermine the stability and enhance the feeling of vulnerability and uncertainty in Western societies.”Â
“We’re going to see more of these attacks,” he added.Â
Low effort, high reward
To this point, the seaborne vandalism has caused limited disruptions. The EU’s power network is among the most well-connected in the world and companies build redundant links to curb the risk of supply shortages.
Instead, “much of the impact is actually on the societal level,” Bueger said. Such incidents often enhance public anxiety and feed “populist narratives in terms of protecting ourselves, looking inward rather than outward.”Â
In 2024, however, Estonia got a glimpse of what might happen in a more severe attack when technical glitches in one cable caused energy bills to spike by 10 percent, said Erkki Sapp, a board member of the country’s state-owned power grid operator Elering.
Imagine if that wasn’t just one power cable or had happened alongside massive data cable destruction. Then, add cyberattacks to the equation.Â
“We can handle any single event, any single problem with energy infrastructure,” Sapp said. “But also if there are several of these sorts of events, then this may lead to issues with security of supply.”
The repercussions could also grow if the attacks spread elsewhere across Europe — especially as the U.S. continues to retreat from its Western allies.
Like its Baltic neighbor, the North Sea is shallow — averaging depths of just 95 meters, leaving it exposed to similar acts of sabotage, according to Phuc-Vinh Nguyen, who heads the Paris-based Jacques Delors Energy Centre.Â
That’s where the vital gas pipelines connecting Norway and mainland Europe lie.
“If you were able to target one infrastructure [link] between Norway and the EU … the supply disruption and effect on prices would lead to a chaotic scenario,” Nguyen said.Â
Most exposed are the EU’s islands, he added.Â
Ireland is one, with its limited power links to the continent. The country is also less capable of monitoring sabotage Â
because neither does it have submarines or military radars, nor is it part of the NATO military alliance. Malta, too, has just one subsea electricity link that provides a quarter of the island’s power.
In a worst-case scenario, Nguyen said, Moscow would time a gas cutoff with pipeline cable ruptures in mid-winter.Â
At that point, he said, “it’s big crisis time.” Sky-high prices. Countries slashing exports to hoard supplies. Consumers losing energy access.Â
Given Europe’s deadlocked standoff with Russia, that’s a “possibility you can’t rule out,” Nguyen said.Â
The tensions aren’t just with Russia. Trump, the U.S. president, is shaking the very concept of a collective, coordinated Western defense. Assurances once seen as ironclad —Â
U.S. troops will defend Europe, transatlantic militaries will cooperate —Â
feel increasingly anachronistic. Late last month, Reuters reported the U.S. had quit a joint effort with Europe to counter Russian sabotage.
“Europe relies on quite a few U.S. surveillance capabilities,” Nguyen said, and “particularly after the Nord Stream incidents, [that] highlighted the fact that Western countries had clearly had a deficit in terms of monitoring this infrastructure.”
That spying equipment isn’t easily replaced. And Russia would know that.
“An unraveling of the transatlantic security relationship …Â
might be an encouragement to the Russians to cause mischief,” said Childs, the maritime defense expert.Â
Subsea solutions
The situation is jolting Europe into action.Â
In January, NATO announced it would deploy frigates, maritime patrol planes and a naval drone fleet to monitor the region as part of a new “Baltic Sentry” program. That came after the alliance set up a new maritime center last year to track critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.
“We are putting substantially more military assets into the area,” said James Appathurai, NATO deputy assistant secretary-general for hybrid and cyber. “More presence, more surveillance, more robust action … should deter ship captains and crew who will be more likely to be caught.”
The EU is also stepping up its efforts.Â
In February, Brussels said it would spend an extra €540 million on new infrastructure by 2027, including subsea connections, as part of a strategy to protect essential cables. The EU also plans to stock up on spare cables and buy dedicated repair vessels for fixing breaks.
“The European Union is … willing and capable also to support and help [its] member states,”Â
European Commission Executive Vice President for Security Henna Virkkunen told POLITICO.Â
“It’s the first part of preparedness that we are not dependent on one connection,” she added, arguing that tackling subsea threats formed part of the EU’s new disaster prepare-and-response plan published last week.
Countries bordering the Baltic Sea are also taking things into their own hands.Â
Finland treats energy infrastructure protection as part of its defense planning — a “total security approach,” said Finnish Environment Minister Sari Multala. The country is exploring buying more repair capacity.
“Having a long border with Russia and also our history,” she added. “We have to be prepared always for the worst.”
Estonia and Lithuania, meanwhile, are mulling draft laws to seize vessels threatening critical infrastructure outside their territorial waters. And the United Kingdom has launched an artificial intelligence scheme that assesses tanker risks through publicly available data on ship movements.
“Our people feel this as an attack to our critical infrastructure,” Estonian Climate Minister Yoko Alender told POLITICO. “The fundamental principle here is European security and independence.”
But crafting an effective response also means entering a legal minefield.
Under international law, countries have few powers to seize suspicious vessels outside their territorial waters — or 12 nautical miles away from their shores, said Sean Pribyl, a partner specializing in international maritime law at Holland & Knight.
Beyond that zone, the ship has the legal right to “innocent passage” and is subject to the laws in the country where it is registered, he said, its so-called flag state.Â
That’s a problem, Pribyl said, because “there’s no policing mechanism” that forces those flag states —Â
often far away and with loose diplomatic ties to Western countries — to take action against suspicious vessels.
The Yi Peng 3 is a case in point. Despite docking between Sweden and Denmark, Beijing refused to allow local authorities to conduct a full investigation of the vessel.
Back on the patrol vessel off the Finnish coast, a powerful wind hammered against the cabin windows. Iljin, the Finnish coast guard chief, expressed fear at how perilously Russian cargo ships were behaving.Â
“These are very shallow waters … so if these vessels have engine problems, for example, they lose maneuverability,” he said, “and then it might hit the ground in a number of hours.”
And Iljin can’t track them properly. “Some of them seem to manipulate their [transponder] devices … which sort of makes them invisible,” he said.Â
So for Iljin, it’s not even a choice. Europe has to adapt to this new reality.
“We are obviously aware [of] where these undersea cables are,” he said. “It’s something that we have prepared for.”

https://apnews.com/article/colombia-peace-talks-eln-commoners-south-disarmament-df5e48c62815d7ba7480e760cc2846b1,"PASTO, Colombia (AP) — A rebel group called the Commoners of the South has begun handing its weapons over to Colombia’s government, the Defense Ministry said Saturday, as part of peace talks expected to lead to the group’s disarmament in the coming months. The group of about 250 fighters operates in Colombia’s Southwestern Nariño province and has been in negotiations with the government since last year. “This is a historic moment,” Defense Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a ceremony in the town of Pasto, where several accords with the group were outlined by officials. Sanchez said that over the past two days, the Commoners of the South have handed over land mines, grenades and rockets to an army unit that is destroying them. “Farmers will be able to walk without the fear of coming across a minefield,” Sanchez said. Until recently, the Commoners of the South was part of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, a group of about 6,000 fighters that is still fighting Colombia’s government. In May last year, the Commoners broke away from the ELN and began peace talks with the administration of President Gustavo Petro. That angered the ELN’s leadership and stymied its negotiations with Colombia’s government. Petro, who was part of a rebel group in his youth, has been staging peace talks with nine separate rebel groups and drug trafficking gangs in Colombia under a strategy known as “total peace.” Most of these negotiations have failed to reduce violence and so far only the Commoners of the South have agreed to begin a transition toward civilian life. “The Commoners of the South are only one of nine problems” faced by the Petro administration, said Gerson Arias, an analyst at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think tank in Bogota. “And they are only a small and marginal segment of Colombia’s armed groups,” he said. Arias said the government has been trying to reach regional agreements with smaller factions of rebel groups that can take some pressure off the population, instead of larger, national accords. “The talks with the Commoners of the South, are the only ones that may end up succeeding” in the Petro administration, Arias said. But he added that some issues still need to be resolved, such as the legal mechanisms through which victims of the group will be able to seek justice and truth. In 2016, Colombia signed a peace deal with the nation’s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in which more than 13,000 fighters laid down their weapons. But the FARC’s withdrawal from some rural areas created a power vacuum that smaller groups have tried to fill. Colombia’s government is now struggling to provide security in remote rural areas, where various groups are fighting over drug trafficking routes and natural resources, while they forcibly recruit minors and tax local businesses to raise funds. Earlier this year, more than 50,000 people were displaced from their homes in Catatumbo, a region along Colombia’s border with Venezuela, after the ELN attacked villages where it accused farmers of supporting a rival group. The Colombian government suspended peace talks with the ELN following those attacks, with Petro accusing its leaders of becoming “greedy” drug traffickers who have betrayed their revolutionary ideals. In Nariño, which is located along Colombia’s border with Ecuador, local officials are hoping that Colombia’s government keeps rebel groups away from the area, by providing greater security and economic development projects. “If a peace deal is reached between the Commoners of the South and the government, we would like to know more about the strategy to protect this territory” said Giovanny Cardenas, a human rights official in the town of Samaniego. “It would be tragic if this group demobilizes and another group comes here to continue the same war.” ___ Rueda reported from Bogota, Colombia.",A rebel group begins handing weapons over to the Colombian government as peace talks advance,"Astrid Suarez, Manuel Rueda",AP News,2025-04-05T17:21:23,2025-04-05T17:21:23,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/russia-american-tater-psychiatric-hospital-b6c80b9198ab3ccd803ebbe88af6e94f,"MOSCOW (AP) — A U.S. citizen awaiting trial in Moscow has been forcibly admitted to a psychiatric hospital, Russian state media reported Sunday. Joseph Tater, 46, was arrested in August 2024 after being accused of assaulting a police officer during a confrontation with staff at an upmarket hotel in the Russian capital. A Moscow court agreed to admit Tater to a psychiatric hospital non-voluntarily after a medical evaluation on March 15, Russian state news agency Tass reported. It said that doctors had described Tater as displaying signs of “tension, impulsivity, persecutory delusions, and lack of self-awareness regarding his condition.” The U.S. Embassy in Moscow declined to comment on the case, citing privacy concerns. Tater had been due to stand trial on April 14 on charges of assaulting a police officer, which is punishable with a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment. It is unclear when the court made its decision to detain him on medical grounds, but Tass previously reported that he had been released from pre-trial detention at the end of March. At a September court hearing, Tater claimed he came to Russia to seek political asylum and that he was being persecuted by the CIA. Tater’s defense lawyer has appealed his forced hospitalization, accusing officials of trying to “isolate the defendant from society,” Tass reported. Human rights groups have repeatedly accused Russia of forcing citizens into psychiatric institutions due to their political views — a Soviet-era practice they say has been increasingly used by President Vladimir Putin’s government. Tater has already served 15 days in jail for the same incident after being found guilty on administrative charges of “petty hooliganism.” He was detained in August 2024 when he became abusive to hotel staff who requested to see his documents, Russian state news agencies reported. They reported that Tater swore and “behaved aggressively” when the hotel refused to accommodate him, and later grabbed the arm of a police officer called to the scene. Tater is just one of several Americans detained in Russia on drug or assault convictions, with many serving sentences of several years. They include Robert Gilman, 72, who was handed 3 1 sentence at the age of 72 after being found guilty of assaulting a police officer following a drunken disturbance on a train, and Travis Leake, a musician who was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 13 years in prison in July 2024.",Moscow court sends US citizen awaiting trial to a psychiatric hospital,,AP News,2025-04-06T07:59:44,2025-04-06T12:41:49,gemini-2.0-flash

Ozgur Ozel was reelected at an extraordinary congress of the Republican People’s Party, or CHP, which he called to prevent what he said was a plot by the government to appoint a caretaker for the party. The arrest of Istanbul’s opposition Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on corruption charges has ignited large-scale anti-government protests. Imamoglu had emerged as the main challenger to Erdogan’s 22-year rule since he was elected mayor of Istanbul in 2019, overturning a quarter-century of rule by parties from Turkey’s conservative Islamist tradition. The opposition claims the charges against Imamoglu are politically motivated, but the government insists the judiciary is independent and free of political interference. While in prison, Imamoglu was confirmed as the CHP’s presidential candidate for the election scheduled for 2028, but which will likely to take place earlier. Ozel said he decided to call Sunday’s party congress on March 21, two days after Imamoglu’s arrest and hours before the alleged government caretaker was to be appointed for CHP. “They didn’t have the courage to compete with us in service, so instead they attempted to intimidate our municipalities and the opposition by using the might of the government against their rivals,” Ozel told the assembly. “They thought they could remain in power by polarizing the public and provoking new conflicts.” Former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou and a delegation from the European Parliament’s Party of European Socialists visited the CHP headquarters Saturday to offer their support and solidarity with “all people fighting for democracy and the rule of law in Turkey.” Turkish media reported that Papandreou attended Sunday’s congress. Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, suffered a major setback during municipal elections last year, when the CHP retained control over key cities like Istanbul and Ankara while also making huge gains elsewhere. In the months since that election, many opposition mayors of both the CHP and the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, have been replaced by government-appointed caretakers on terrorism charges, which the parties strongly dispute.",Turkish opposition party reelects chairman following arrest of Istanbul mayor,,AP News,2025-04-06T15:06:30,2025-04-06T11:06:30,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/bolsonaro-brazil-coup-attempt-amnesty-law-trial-25975a7b422c7d0edff4436f7cafc9bb,"SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) — Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro led a rally Sunday in support of an amnesty law that could free him from criminal charges and eliminate the prison sentences of dozens of supporters who stormed the nation’s congress two years ago to protest the election of his successor, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has been charged by Brazilian prosecutors of trying to organize a coup following his defeat to Lula in the October 2022 election, with investigators saying he plotted with 33 others to poison Lula and kill a supreme court judge. In March, a panel of supreme court judges accepted the charges and launched a trial against Bolsonaro, where the former president will face five counts that include attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organization, and threatening the state’s assets and heritage sites. On Sunday, Bolsonaro dismissed the charges, which he claims are part of a political persecution against him. Speaking to thousands of supporters who gathered in one of Sao Paulo’s main avenues wearing yellow Brazil soccer jerseys, Bolsonaro said he had faith in the Brazilian people and hoped that Congress would approve an amnesty law drafted by his allies. “We have a way out of this,” Bolsonaro said. Bolsonaro, a conservative who has long expressed his admiration for President Donald Trump, said that Brazilian courts were trying to “hunt him” with “lawfare” just like courts in France recently went after far-right leader Marine Le Pen. The former president was barred from running for office until 2030 by Brazil’s electoral court, for making unfounded claims about the nation’s electoral system, that suggested voting machines had been rigged. Bolsonaro has said he will challenge that ruling and is planning to run for office in the 2026 presidential election. “To hold elections in 2026 without Jair Bolsonaro, is to negate democracy” Bolsonaro said during Sunday’s rally.",Brazil's Bolsonaro leads rally in support of amnesty law as he faces trial for alleged coup plot,,AP News,2025-04-06T16:35:12,2025-04-06T18:52:15,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/mali-algeria-sahel-alliance-drone-a42b34f060eb91edb28da49687cf8c5a,"BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — Relations between Algeria and the military alliance of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger plunged to historic lows Monday as the two sides curtailed diplomatic ties in a spat over a downed drone last week. Algeria says it shot down the Malian drone March 31 when it crossed into its air space near the border town of Tin Zaouatine. Mali denies the drone crossed the border, and the three-country bloc — the Alliance of Sahel States or AES — called the downing an “irresponsible act” that violated international law. The three countries pulled their ambassadors from Algeria late Sunday, and Algeria followed suit Monday by withdrawing its ambassadors from those countries. Algeria and Mali also announced they were barring each other’s planes from entering their airspace. Algeria denied any wrongdoing in the drone incident and accused Mali of trying to redirect blame for its internal problems. “The junta of putschists ruling in Mali is vainly attempting to make our country a scapegoat for the setbacks and woes of which the Malian people are paying the heaviest price,” Algeria’s foreign ministry said in a statement. Mali, which uses drones against rebels in the region, has said that Algeria’s actions proved that it “sponsored international terrorism.” The Malian government has pursued an aggressive campaign to combat rebels in its northern regions, where a mixture of Tuareg movements and transnational jihadi groups wield power. Amnesty International last year accused Mali’s army of using drones against civilians in incidents in which the government claimed they were targeting jihadist groups. Mali on Sunday said it had summoned the Algerian ambassador, withdrawn from a 15-year-old regional military group that includes Algeria, and planned to file a complaint with international bodies about the drone incident. The escalation comes after months of rising tensions between Algeria and its southern neighbors, including Mali. Since seizing control, the region’s juntas have reshaped the balance of power in northwest Africa. Military leaders in the three AES countries — Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso — left the Economic Community of West African States, the nearly 50-year-old regional bloc known as ECOWAS. They created their own security partnership, the Alliance of Sahel States, in September last year. Algeria has one of Africa’s largest militaries and has long considered itself a regional power. The military leaders of the three Sahel nations have recently distanced themselves from Algeria as they have championed autonomy and sought new alliances, including with Russia. Rida Lyammouri, a Sahel expert at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, said the latest war of words was unlikely to escalate beyond that. “Mali, and other AES members would not engage militarily against Algeria, and vice versa,” he said, noting Mali did not fully control its border areas. Algeria once served as a key mediator during more than a decade of conflict between Mali’s government and Tuareg rebels. But the two countries have grown apart since a military junta staged coups in 2020 and 2021, putting military personnel in charge of Mali’s key institutions. Algeria has denounced the direction that Mali’s new government has taken and its expanded efforts to quash rebellion in historically volatile parts of northern Mali. Afraid of the conflict spilling over the border, Algerian officials have denounced Mali’s use of Russian mercenaries and armed drones near Tin Zaouatine, a border town in the north were the drone was found. The Malian government did not recover the drone and videos seen on social media, posted by northern rebels, show them in possession of the remains of a Turkish made Akinci drone manufactured by Baykar downed in Tin Zaouatine. Mali purchased at least two from the Turkish company last year and has used them against armed separatists as well as fighters linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. __ Metz reported from Rabat, Morocco and McMakin from Dakar, Senegal.",Drone downing sparks diplomatic fallout between Algeria and Sahel countries,"Wilson Mcmakin, Baba Ahmed, Sam Metz",AP News,2025-04-06T19:36:38,2025-04-07T17:15:16,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/iran-rial-currency-us-7077a417560efcb6d9cbf7102cbc8b57,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran ’s rial currency traded Saturday at a record low against the U.S. dollar as the country returned to work after a long holiday, costing over 1 million rials for a single greenback as tensions between Tehran and Washington likely will push it even lower. The exchange rate had plunged to over 1 million rials during the Persian New Year, Nowruz, as currency shops closed and only informal trading took place on the streets, creating additional pressure on the market. But as traders resumed work Saturday, the rate fell even further to 1,043,000 to the dollar, signaling the new low appeared here to stay. On Ferdowsi Street in Iran’s capital, Tehran, the heart of the country’s money exchanges, some traders even switched off their electronic signs showing the going rate as uncertainty loomed over how much further the rial could drop. “We turn it off since we are not sure about the successive changes of the rate,” said Reza Sharifi, who works at one exchange. Iran’s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. At the time of the 2015 deal, which saw Iran drastically limit its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium in exchange for lifting of international sanctions, the rial traded at 32,000 to the dollar. After Trump returned to the White House for his second term in January, he restarted his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign targeting Tehran with sanctions. He again went after firms trading Iranian crude oil, including those selling at a discount in China. Trump meanwhile has written to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, trying to jumpstart direct talks between Tehran and Washington. So far, Iran has maintained it is willing for indirect talks, but such discussions under the Biden administration failed to make headway. Meanwhile, Trump is continuing an intense airstrike campaign targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the last force in Tehran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance” able to attack Israel after other militant groups were mauled by Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Mehdi Darabi, a market analyst, said he believed that foreign pressures in recent months caused “expectations for the possibility of a decrease in oil sales and more inflation, and it caused a higher rate for hard currencies,” according to Tehran’s Donay-e-Eqtesad economic newspaper. A pensioner who gave only his first name, Saeed, for fear of reprisals, said if Iran stopped its hostile policy toward the outside, financial relief could be possible. “If we want to live a comfortable life, we should maintain good ties with our neighbors,” he said. “We shouldn’t bare our teeth at them. They will do the same.” Economic upheavals have evaporated the public’s savings, pushing average Iranians into holding onto hard currencies, gold, cars and other tangible wealth. Others pursue cryptocurrencies or fall into get-rich-quick schemes. Meanwhile, internal political pressure remains inflamed still over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past. Iran’s theocracy has responded by dialing broadly back hijab enforcement and easing restrictions on at least one political figure. On Saturday, the state-run IRNA news agency even quoted a portions of a statement from Mehdi Karroubi, a Shiite cleric, parliament speaker and two-time presidential candidate who has been held in his home since the 2011 Arab Spring protests. Karroubi, who also was one of the leaders of Iran’s 2009 Green Movement protests, is in the process of being released from house arrest. “The end of my house arrest has coincided with a super-crisis that has ... put the country at the verge of devastating war,” his statement said. The falling rial has put more pressure as well on Iranian reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. In March, when the rate was 930,000 rials to the dollar, Iran’s parliament impeached his finance minister, Abdolnasser Hemmati over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement. Anger over government spending also saw Pezeshkian fire his vice president in charge of parliamentary affairs, Shahram Dabiri, for taking a luxury cruise to Antarctica, state media reported. Though Dabiri reportedly used his own money for the trip with his wife, the Instagram photos posted of his trip angered an Iranian public scrapping by to survive. “In a situation where the economic pressures on people are huge and the number of deprived people is massive, expensive recreational trip by officials even by their own personal fund is not defendable and reasonable,” Pezeshkian said in firing Dabiri, who so far hasn’t offered any public explanation for his trip. Pezeshkian separately said Saturday that Iran wanted a “dialogue from an equal position” with the U.S. “If you want negotiations, what is the point of threatening?” Pezeshkian asked, according to IRNA. “America today is not only humiliating Iran, but the world, and this behavior contradicts the call for negotiations.” ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.","Iran currency falls to record low of 1,043,000 rials to $1","Nasser Karimi, Jon Gambrell",AP News,2025-04-05T10:14:14,2025-04-05T13:14:11,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-mass-vatican-50973c32de3f6e2cc1fd9dc036968f70,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francismade a surprise entrance to St. Peter’s Square during a special Jubilee Mass for the sick and health workers on Sunday, marking his first public appearance at the Vatican sinceleaving the hospital two weeks ago after a life-threatening bout with pneumonia. The pontiff waved at the crowd of faithful that stood and applauded as he was pushed in a wheelchair unannounced to the front of the altar in the square. Some exclaimed, “I see the pope!’' as his image first emerged on a big screen showing him passing through the Holy Door before being brought down a ramp to the altar. “Good Sunday to everyone,’’ Francis said, speaking into a microphone, which he tapped to make sure it was working on a second attempt. “Thank you very much.” The pontiff’s voice sounded stronger than when he addressed well-wishers outside of Gemelli hospital on the day of his release March 23, after a five-week hospital stay. He wore nasal tubes to receive supplemental oxygen, which the Vatican says is being gradually reduced. As he waved and blessed the crowd, his arm movements remained limited — which his doctorsaid was not related to his illness but to an unspecified trauma suffered before his Feb. 14 hospitalization. After the Mass, the pontiff greeted some of those who assisted in the service, many who bowed to kiss his hands. He exited the square through the Holy Door. Francis has just completed two weeks of at least two months of doctor-ordered rest as he continues physical, respiratory and speech therapy, as well as treatment for a lingering lung infection. The pope referred to his experience with illness in both the traditional Sunday blessing and the homily read by Archbishop Rino Fisichella, organizer of the Holy Year that is expected to bring some 30 million pilgrims to Rome. Addressing the sick among the crowd, the pope said in the homily read by Fisichella that “In this moment of my life I share a lot: the experience of infirmity, feeling weak, depending on the others for many things, needing support. “It is not easy, but it is a school in which we learn every day to love and to let ourselves be loved, without demanding and without rejecting, without regretting, without despairing, grateful to God and to our brothers for the good that we receieve, trusting for what is still to come.’' He also urged the faithful not to push the fragile from their lives “as unfortunately a certain mentality does today. Let’s not ostracize pain from our surroundings. Let’s instead make it an opportunity to grow together, to cultivate hope.’' In the traditional Sunday blessing, he offered prayers for doctors, nurses and health care workers “who are not always helped to work in inadequate conditions, at times the victims of aggression. Their mission is not easy and must be supported and respected.’' The faithful were moved by the pope’s unexpected appearance. ‘’It was beautiful, something completely unexpected because I didn’t think I would see the pope,’' said Pasquale Citrolo from Trapani, Sicily. “Instead he gave us this gift.’' Linda Elezi, from the Adriatic coastal province of Ancona, said she was touched by the pope’s “surprise.’' “We pray for him every day, and he prays for us, and for peace and for all the wold, because that is the message of our pilgrimage today: Bring peace to all the world,’' she said. ____ Barry reported from Milan.",Pope appears before crowd in St. Peter’s Square,"Silvia Stellacci, Colleen Barry",AP News,2025-04-06T05:55:08,2025-04-06T11:43:07,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250406000700320?section=economy-finance/economy,"SEOUL, April 6 (Yonhap) -- The South Korean government plans to inject 3 trillion won (US$2 billion) in emergency aid into the local car industry to cushion the blow from new 25 percent U.S. tariffs, officials said Sunday. The new tariffs, enacted last week by U.S. President Donald Trump, are part of a broader protectionist push to reduce trade deficits and strengthen domestic manufacturing. South Korea is among the countries hit hardest, with its car exports to the United States accounting for nearly half of its total car sales overseas. At a ministerial meeting scheduled for this week, the government will approve the emergency financing plan, which will be carried out through state-run lenders, such as the Korea Development Bank (KDB). ""The financial support will likely amount to around 3 trillion won, though the exact figure hasn't been finalized,"" said an official from the Ministry of Economy and Finance. ""It will be disbursed through KDB's existing loan programs."" Cars are parked at a port in Pyeongtaek, some 65 kilometers south of Seoul, on April 3, 2025. (Yonhap) In addition, the KDB and other policy lenders will provide up to 248 trillion won this year in broader financial support to help businesses navigate worsening global conditions and restructure industrial sectors. The government has also confirmed plans to establish a 50 trillion-won strategic fund over the next five years to support the development of future mobility technologies in response to growing economic uncertainty following the start of Trump's second term. The Financial Services Commission will also meet with top executives from major commercial banks and state-run lenders on Monday, encouraging them to participate in the coordinated effort to support the struggling auto sector. Cars are South Korea's top export item to the United States. In 2024, auto exports to the U.S. reached $34.7 billion, accounting for nearly half of all South Korean vehicle exports. Analysts warn that the new tariffs will significantly impact the country's economy by driving up the prices of Korean cars in the U.S. market. A report published by the IBK Economic Research Institute estimated that South Korea's car exports to the U.S. will decrease by 18.6 percent once Washington imposes 25 percent tariffs on car imports. brk@yna.co.kr(END)",S.

https://apnews.com/article/syria-saudi-arabia-ahmad-alsharaa-trip-facf664205c3362de15e67b73527c92b,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Syria’s interim president made his first trip abroad Sunday, traveling to Saudi Arabia in a move likely trying to signal Damascus’ shift away from Iran as its main regional ally. Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, landed in Riyadh alongside his government’s foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani. The two men traveled on a Saudi jet, with a Saudi flag visible on the table behind them. Saudi state television trumpeted the fact that al-Sharaa, first known internationally by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, made Riyadh his first destination. Syria’s new three-star, tricolor flag flew next to Saudi Arabia’s own at the airport as al-Sharaa in a suit and tie walked off the plane. He later met with a smiling Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, at al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. The state-run Saudi Press Agency described their discussions as examining ways to “support the security and stability of sisterly Syria.” Syria’s state-run SANA news agency quoted al-Sharaa as saying they “worked on raising the level of communication and cooperation in all areas, especially those humanitarian and economic.” Saudi Arabia had been among the Arab nations that poured money into insurgent groups that tried to topple President Bashar Assad after Syria’s 2011 Arab Spring protests turned into a bloody crackdown. However, its groups found themselves beaten back as Assad, supported by Iran and Russia, fought the war into a stalemate in Syria. That changed with the December lightning offensive led by al-Sharaa’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The group was once affiliated with al-Qaida but has since denounced its former ties. Al-Sharaa and HTS have carefully managed their public image in the time since, with the interim president favoring an olive-colored military look similar to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appointing women to roles and trying to maintain ties to Syria’s Christian and Shiite Alawite populations. That also includes keeping both Iran and Russia largely at arms’ length as well. Iran has yet to reopen its embassy in Damascus, which had been a key node in running operations through its self-described “Axis of Resistance,” including Assad’s Syria, Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia and other partners. Iranian state media noted the trip to Saudi Arabia, a longtime regional rival with which it struck a Chinese-mediated détente in 2023, without acknowledging its own challenges in Syria. Russia, meanwhile, would like to maintain access to air and sea bases it has in Syria, but took in Assad when he fled Syria during the advance. Those moves appear aimed at reassuring the West and trying to get crippling sanctions lifted on Syria. Rebuilding the country after over a decade of war will likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars, not to mention the cost of covering the needs of Syria’s people, millions of whom remain impoverished. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan visited Damascus in January and said Riyadh has been “actively engaging in dialogue” to lift sanctions on Syria. Saudi Arabia, unlike Al-Sharaa’s key allies in Turkey and Qatar, restored ties with Assad in 2023 alongside most of the Arab world. Getting sanctions lifted could go a long way in cementing their relationship. Before al-Sharaa’s trip, he hosted Qatar’s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, in Damascus as his first foreign head of state. Meanwhile, Syria’s interim government still faces challenges from the Islamic State group and other militants in the country. On Saturday, a car bomb exploded in Manbij, a city in Syria’s Aleppo governorate, killing four civilians and wounding nine, SANA reported, citing civil defense officials. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels had seized Manbij in December, part of a push by Ankara to secure Syrian territory close to its border for a buffer zone. —— Associated Press writer Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed to this report.",Syria's interim president visits Saudi Arabia on first trip,Jon Gambrell,AP News,2025-02-02T08:14:23,2025-02-02T08:30:46,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/poland-cyberattack-tusk-2773f16eacae3186e5bf0a18964c9bdc,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Wednesday that his centrist political party was the target of a cyberattack, and suggested that it could have been interference from the east — meaning Russia or Belarus — ahead of Poland’s presidential election next month. Tusk announced on the X platform that his Civic Platform party’s computer system was targeted. “Foreign interference in elections begins. Services point to eastern trace,” Tusk said. Jan Grabiec, the head of Tusk’s office, told the Polish state news agency PAP that the cyberattack consisted of an attempt to take control of computers of employees of the Civic Platform office and the election staff over about a dozen hours on Wednesday. Asked if Tusk was pointing the finger at Russia or Belarus, Grabiec said that would be for Poland’s secret services to comment on, but that in past cases Belarusians have infiltrated Poland’s systems on behalf of Russian intelligence services.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-849099,"Defense Minister Israel Katzon Sunday disclosed to the public a document and communications for what he said was proof of the Hamas and Iran connection relating to the Gaza terror group seeking financial support for the October 7 invasion. The document was intercepted by Israeli soldiers during the invasion of Gaza and forwarded to the IDF intelligence Catalogue unit, which analyzes intercepted foreign intelligence items. According to Katz, the document and communications show that Hamas requested $500 million from the Islamic Republic ""to destroy Israel"", sometime before or leading up to the October 7 invasion. Further, the defense minister said that the head of Palestinian Affairs for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, known as ""Izadi,"" approved the request made by now-deceased Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif. Katz said that Izadi said he would approve the terror financing assistance despite Tehran being under financial strain and sanctions because of the supreme importance of embracing conflict against Israel and the US. He added that the world must realize that Iran is ""the head of the snake"" which has directed the malign activities of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and terror groups in Syria and Iraq. Despite the revelation, Israeli intelligence has said Iran did not know the exact timing or plans of the October 7 invasion, but rather has focused on the idea that Hamas could not have pulled off the invasion without IRGC training, weapons, and funding. The documents are from October 2020 and June 2021 and Sinwar brought them into his tunnel lair during the current war. In February 2024, the IDF produced documents that it obtained from tunnel areas in Khan Yunis, purporting to show the transfer of $154 million in funds from Iran to Hamas.In February 2024, the IDF produced documents that it obtained from tunnel areas in Khan Yunis, purporting to show the transfer of $154 million in funds from Iran to Hamas.

Israel last monthended its ceasefirewith Hamas and hasseized territoryto pressure the militant group to accept a new deal for a truce and release of remaining hostages. It has blocked the import offood, fuel and other suppliesfor over a month to the coastal territory heavily reliant on outside assistance. Israel’s military late Sunday ordered Palestinians to evacuate several neighborhoods in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah shortly after about 10 projectiles were fired from Gaza 	 the largest barrage from the territory since Israel resumed the war. The military said about five were intercepted. Hamas’ military arm claimed responsibility. Police said a rocket fell in Ashkelon city and fragments fell in several other areas. The Magen David Adom emergency service said one man was lightly injured. The military later said it struck a rocket launcher in Gaza. Israeli strikes overnight into Sunday hit a tent and a house in the southern city of Khan Younis, killing five men, five women and five children, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. The body of a toddler took up one end of an emergency stretcher. A female journalist was among the dead. “My daughter is innocent. She had no involvement, she loved journalism and adored it,” said her mother, Amal Kaskeen. “Trump wants to end the Gaza issue. He is in a hurry, and that is clear from this morning,” said Mohammad Abdel-Hadi, cousin of a woman killed. Israeli shelling killed at least four people in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The bodies of seven people, including a child and three women, arrived at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, according to an Associated Press journalist there. And a strike in Gaza City hit people waiting outside a bakery and killed at least six, including three children, according to the civil defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government. Dozens of Palestinians took to the streets in Jabaliya for new anti-war protests. Footage on social media showed people marching and chanting against Hamas. Such protests, while rare, have occurred in recent weeks. There is also anger inside Israel over the war’s resumption and its effects on remaining hostages in Gaza. Families of hostages along with some of those recently freed from Gaza and their supporters have urged Trump to help ensure the fighting ends. Netanyahu on Monday will meet with Trump for the second time since Trump began his latest term in January. The prime minister said they would discuss the war and the new 17%tariff imposedon Israel, part of a sweeping global decision by the U.S. “There is a very large queue of leaders who want to do this with respect to their economies. I think it reflects the special personal connection and the special connection between the United States and Israel, which is so vital at this time,” Netanyahu said while wrapping up a visit to Hungary. The U.S., a mediator in ceasefire efforts along with Egypt and Qatar, had expressed support for Israel’s resumption of the war last month. Hundreds of Palestinians since then have been killed, among them 15 medics whose bodies were recovered only a week later. Israel’s military this weekendbacktracked on its accountof what happened in the incident, captured in part on video, that angered Red Cross and Red Crescent and U.N. officials. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Fifty-nine hostages are still held in Gaza 	 24 believed to be alive. Israel’s offensive has killed at least 50,695 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says more than half were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. Early Monday, strikes hit inside the compound of Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where an Associated Press camera caught the sound of the explosions. Smoke and fire were seen from distance, and there were no immediate reports of casualties. The Palestinian Health Ministry in the occupied West Bank said one Palestinian-American teen was killed and two others were injured 	 one in critical condition 	 and asserted that Israeli settlers had shot them. Israel’s military said it was looking into the incident in Turmus Ayya town, which is near Jerusalem and has a large population of Palestinian-Americans. The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with Israel’s military carrying out military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians anddisplaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis. ___ Associated Press writer Natalie Melzer in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at","Israeli strikes on Gaza kill at least 32 people, mostly women and children",,AP News,2025-04-06T11:20:13,2025-04-06T21:45:14,gemini-2.0-flash

He made his remarks “in response to statements by US President Donald Trump, who expressed his preference for this formula in any potential dialogue with Iran,” UAE-based Al-Ain Media reported. “Direct negotiations with a party that constantly threatens the use of force, in violation of the UN Charter, and adopts contradictory positions are meaningless,” Araghchi was quoted as saying. “We remain committed to diplomacy and are ready to try the path of indirect negotiations,” he added. Iran, “while committed to dialogue to dispel misunderstandings and resolve differences, remains prepared for all scenarios and will be serious about defending its interests and national sovereignty, just as it is serious about diplomacy and negotiations,” Araghchi said. On Saturday, other Iranian officials said Iran was not interested in conflict but would defend itself if attacked. Russia would back Iran in any talks with the US, Iranian state media reported. “This stance comes at a time when there are growing signs of a renewed escalation between the two sides, amid uncertainty surrounding the fate of the Iranian nuclear issue, and warnings of a slide toward open confrontation that could have disastrous repercussions for the region,” Al-Ain reported. Trump sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader in March, offering talks. Nevertheless, he has also said the US could carry out airstrikes against Iran. “While Washington continues its policy of ‘maximum pressure,’ Tehran responds with its own complex equations, within a complex regional and international context that presents diplomacy with a difficult test,” Al-Ain reported.

https://apnews.com/article/turkey-crackdown-opposition-protest-dissent-imamoglu-politics-6f641b9b90c8b9500d411578443d2768,"ISTANBUL (AP) — The arrest of an opposition presidential candidate last month has triggered Turkey’s largest anti-government protests in more than a decade, uniting demonstrators from different walks of life and sometimes diametrically opposed political views. It includes supporters of popular Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, and young people who see all politicians as ineffective. Protesters range from the socialist left to the ultra-nationalist right, and from university students to retirees. They are united by a sense that the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has grown increasingly authoritarian, diminishing the secular and democratic values and laws that the country was built upon. They are fueled by outrage at Imamoglu’s arrest and the government’s attempts to quell the ensuing protests. Protests began after opposition leader was arrested The protests began after the government arrested Imamoglu, the man seen as posing the most serious electoral challenge to Erdogan in years, on March 19. Prosecutors accuse him of corruption and aiding an outlawed Kurdish organization. Critics say the charges are an excuse to get a key rival out of the way, but the government denies interfering with the legal process. The largest protests have happened alongside rallies of Imamoglu’s center-left pro-secularist Republican People’s Party, known as the CHP, but many young protesters said they don’t support the party. Ogulcan Akti, a 26-year-old university student working two part-time jobs to support his family, said both the opposition and the ruling party are “liars.” “The ones in power and the opposition that will come later, they’re all the same,” he said. “We don’t trust anyone.” Students led the charge In the days after the mayor’s arrest, thousands of students converged near Istanbul city hall. Some waved Turkish flags; others held images of left-wing figures from the 1970s and sang a Turkish version of the Italian protest song “Bella ciao.” In images on social media, some protesters made the ultranationalist “grey wolf” hand sign, standing next to others showing the leftists’ raised fist. Some showed the peace sign favored by both leftists and pro-Kurdish groups, while others chanted slogans attacking the banned militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party. Berk Esen, an associate professor of political science at Sabanci University, said most protesters he has seen are educated, urban young people aged 18 to 25, but they have little else in common: “This is a much more amorphous, eclectic group politically,” he said. Anger spurs unrest One afternoon last week, dozens of students from Bogazici University gathered at a metro station in Istanbul, many wearing masks to avoid reprisals or arrest. More than 2,000 people, including journalists, have been detained since the protests began. Around 300 were formally arrested on charges including “joining an illegal protest” and “resisting the police,” with some accused of “terrorism links.” Lawyers for the arrested students say that the charge of “joining an illegal protest” does not justify extended detention, and that the number of arrests is “unusually high” compared to offenses such as terrorism or drugs.  At the metro station, 22-year-old management student Burak Turan and his girlfriend slipped into a mall, watching officers detain dozens of protesters. “We are here because so many students are getting arrested for no reason,” Turan said. “They act like it’s a war; they are exercising wartime laws.” Turan refused to wear a mask, saying he had nothing to be ashamed of. Other protesters include public employees, artists and retirees, many of whom support the CHP. A man in his 60s watching a standoff at city hall said he was there to defend the rights of the younger generation. “We don’t matter, they do. They are our future.” he said. Others were there to speak out against as what they perceived as a slide away from Turkey’s secular and democratic values under Erdogan. Mehtap Bozkurt, a 70-year-old pensioner and a CHP supporter, joined a protest outside Istanbul city hall. “This country is secular and will remain secular,” she said. “We will resist until the end. I am ready to give my life and blood for this issue.” That doesn’t mean that people protesting aren’t practicing Muslims, said Esen, the Sabanci academic. “There are Muslims, religious people and those who at least perform some religious duties amongst the protesters,” he said. “But they also probably define themselves as secular.” Parents protest treatment of students Outside the courts in Istanbul, parents and relatives, some holding flowers, maintained an anxious vigil. Some hoped for a loved one’s immediate release, while others were overcome with frustration. One family member, who asked to remain anonymous fearing reprisals from officials, told local media that the detained students had “studied day and night to get into the best universities.” “Look at the treatment they are receiving now. There are no rights. There is no law. There is no justice,” she said. Another woman showed journalists a picture of her son with a black eye. “He told me, ‘Mom, they beat me up,’” she said tearfully. Another woman said she was a cancer patient left waiting since dawn. “What did these kids do? Did they murder someone? What did they even do?” Around 300 protesters spent the Eid holiday in prison, separated from their families.  Lawyers for several protesters told The Associated Press that students are held in overcrowded cells and face physical and verbal mistreatment, as well as limited access to meals since prison commissaries are closed for Eid. Lawyers also fear that students could miss exams or be expelled as a “punishment” for taking part in the protests. On Thursday the police issued a statement describing as “vile slander” claims that women had been sexually assaulted in custody.  The Interior Ministry said that at least 150 police officers were injured in clashes with demonstrators. Images from the protests showed riot police using tear gas and plastic pellets, while students threw plastic water bottles and flares. A pivotal moment Esen says the protests may mark a pivotal moment for Turkey. “Will the police violence used by the government against them make them throw in the towel after a certain point or will it bring about a bigger showdown and make this a long-term affair? If the latter happens, I will be very optimistic about Turkey becoming democratic again. If the former happens, all of this is heading toward a very bad place,” he said.  A young female protester wearing a mask watched the standoff with police unfolding near city hall last week. “I am here today because I do not accept autocracy,” she said. “Ekrem Imamoglu’s arrest means that we accept that there will be no more elections in this country. I do not accept this.”","Facing a government crackdown on dissent, Turkey's protesters put aside their differences",Robert Badendieck,AP News,2025-04-06T05:02:00,2025-04-06T01:02:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/04/06/2003834692,"The Han Kuang exercises, Taiwan’s largest annual military drills, began yesterday, with experts saying that the extended 14 days of war games were in response to China’s increasing “gray zone” activities and its potential to carry out a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. This year’s exercises started with around-the-clock computer-aided war games, using the US-built Joint Theater Level Simulation platform. The live-fire component of the exercises is to be held from July 9 to 18. The drills are to create scenarios in which Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) military exercises escalate into an attack on Taiwan, said Major General Tung Chi-hsing (董冀星), director of the Ministry of National Defense’s joint operations planning division. The Han Kuang exercises would also simulate PLA “gray zone” activities, which are provocative or aggressive actions that fall just short of an open conflict, Tung told a news conference on Wednesday. Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Ting-yu (王定宇) on Friday said that the public used to think that a first strike by China would likely come in the form of a missile attack. However, it is more realistic to think that a first strike would involve maritime militia vessels, sand dredgers and drones, which are commonly used in “gray zone” operations, he said. Wang, a member of the legislature’s Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, said the military has to consider how to deal with situations that go beyond traditional force-on-force confrontations. These include how to respond to “gray zone” activities within the bounds of international law, while preventing Chinese military drills from escalating into a full-scale invasion, he said. Such complex scenarios require detailed planning and simulation, making the war games more time-consuming, he said. Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), director of the Division of Defense Strategy and Resources at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, expressed similar views, saying that the Han Kuang drills were likely extended this year from eight days to two weeks to facilitate more scenarios involving “gray zone” tactics. When the PLA is conducting its naval and air patrols around Taiwan, it usually deploys six to 10 warships, Su said, adding that if each of them were equipped with vertical launching systems, there could be about 500 land-attack cruise missiles ready to strike targets across Taiwan within three minutes. That would leave defense forces with even less response time than if Dongfeng (East Wind, 東風) missiles were launched across the Taiwan Strait from China, he said. That makes simulating such scenarios critically important, particularly as PLA drills near Taiwan have become more frequent in the past few years, he added. Minister of National Defense Minister Wellington Koo (顧立雄) in a recent legislative hearing said this year’s Han Kuang exercises would be based on a hypothetical invasion by the PLA in 2027, Su said. That year would mark several milestones in China, such as the 100th anniversary of the PLA’s founding, the start of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s (習近平) fourth term in office and the 12th year of Xi’s military reforms, he said. This year’s exercises would test how the Ministry of National Defense would respond in the event of a 2027 invasion and assess any shortcomings in the armed forces’ readiness and arsenal of weapons, Su said.",Han Kuang drills to target China’s ‘gray zone’ tactics,"Staff writer, with CNA",Taipei Times,2025-04-06T00:00:00,2025-04-05T23:40:13,gemini-2.0-flash

The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy held a meeting with officials from the home appliances, display and machinery industries earlier in the day and plans to hold a separate meeting with those from the rechargeable battery, petrochemical and textiles industries on Monday, according to ministry officials. In Friday's meeting, the home appliances, display and machinery companies called for active support measures by the government to minimize U.S. duties' impact on local businesses, including export vouchers and emergency cash injections. The companies expressed concerns over a potential drop in their exports to America and increased competition in overseas markets other than the U.S., according to the ministry.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans to impose 10 percent baseline tariffs on imports from all foreign countries, as well as ""reciprocal"" tariffs, including 25 percent duties for South Korea, sparking fears of a global trade war. The baseline and reciprocal tariffs will go into effect on Saturday and Wednesday (U.S. time), respectively. ""The ministry will work to minimize the damage on local companies by closely assessing the effects of reciprocal tariffs in each sector, and use all of the government's available resources to boost the fundamental competitiveness of our industries,"" said Lee Seung-ryeol, deputy minister for industry policy at the ministry. Separately, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun held a high-level officials' meeting after the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law decree in December.

https://www.ilmessaggero.it/en/pope_francis_uncertain_path_to_recovery-8761087.html?refresh_ce,"VATICAN CITY Uncertainty, caution, disorientation. At Santa Marta, they are truly navigating by sight. The pleasant ""surprise"" that Pope Francis wanted to offer for tomorrow's Angelus at noon, showing himself in front of the cameras for a few minutes—from inside Santa Marta—will have to wait for a more favorable time. When will that be? Who knows. In the Vatican, they shrug their shoulders despondently. From the airtight isolation on the second floor of the Domus where Bergoglio lives, hardly anything emerges, though many, knowing the stubbornness and unpredictability of this pontiff, do not even exclude that tomorrow morning, perhaps feeling a bit better than today, he might try again to record the brief message of thanks that he declined. This afternoon, Vatican technicians arrived at Santa Marta with all the equipment, awaiting instructions. They waited a bit and were eventually sent back. Francis didn't feel up to it. Nothing particularly concerning, and perhaps it's even normal for a patient with such a clinical picture to have moments of reconsideration, weakness, or temporary apathy, followed by alternating better phases. Yesterday, the Vatican staff had announced that Sunday's appointment would finally be different and would break the heavy media silence that has been ongoing for months. Naturally, no particular details were added, although it was clear that the Pope could now perfectly record a short video to circulate at noon. A second hypothesis was even seriously considered, that he might appear live in front of the cameras for a few minutes, just enough time to bless and thank the faithful worldwide for the devotion shown during his illness. Tomorrow, the Angelus for the eighth consecutive Sunday should only be in written form. It is also expected that at the end of the Mass in St. Peter's Square for the Jubilee of the Sick, Monsignor Rino Fisichella will read a brief papal message to the faithful. Bergoglio wants to express gratitude to millions of people who send a thought, a prayer, a message, a letter, or a drawing to the Vatican every day. Since the health risks for the pontiff are still quite high at this stage of convalescence, every decision is evaluated by the attending physicians and healthcare workers who, in agreement with the illustrious patient, help orient towards the best solution. The ""protected convalescence"" path—as it was called by the hospital team—requires several weeks of care and caution, and the slightest misstep can be dangerous, even excessive strain on the vocal cords already stressed during the long hospital stay for high-flow oxygen administration. Any uncalculated risk can turn back the clock. Consequently, everything is measured with common sense. Probably, Pope Francis is chomping at the bit; the isolation period is heavy, and he desires to soon resume some activities, for example, communicating with people again as he did before, even through indirect communication methods. In the Vatican, they assure that the improvements towards recovery are real, visible, and noticeable daily, thanks to motor and respiratory therapies, but bilateral pneumonia is not yet healed, the foci persist, and antibiotic treatments are still ongoing. To date, it's difficult to imagine if and when Pope Francis will be able to do the same things as before, such as intense and tiring trips, long celebrations, or the deadly concentration of daily appointments on the agenda. For this month, the meeting of the Council of Cardinals (the fifty-first) has been canceled: it was announced at the beginning of last December for April 2025 and would have been used to discuss the Synod and synodality. Meanwhile, Pope Francis from the Gemelli Polyclinic last month arranged that in 2028 he wants to convene a worldwide Ecclesial Assembly instead of the ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops. An attentive observer like Luis Badilla, former director of the para-Vatican site Sismografo, wonders if ""four months ago there was or wasn't this project? Or was it only thought of in these last three months? Above all, I wonder why the communication was made while the Pope was hospitalized and, finally, why nothing was anticipated to the members of the Council of Cardinals?""",Pope Francis' Uncertain Path to Recovery,Franca Giansoldati,Il Messaggero,2025-04-05T13:10:15,2025-04-06T16:30:28,gemini-2.0-flash

— Another round of torrential rain and flash floodingcame Saturday for parts of the South and Midwestalready heavily waterloggedby days of severe storms that also spawned deadly tornadoes. Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days. Overnight into Sunday morning there were new tornado warnings issued in Alabama and Mississippi, along with flash flood warnings in several counties in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. Day after day of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies in from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach what the agency calls “major flood stage,”with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible. At least 16 weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee. A 57-year-old man died Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky including a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said. Also Saturday, a 5-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided. Tornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighborhoods and were responsible for at least seven of the deaths. There were 521 flights cancelled and more than 6,400 flights delayed within the U.S. or coming into or leaving the country on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday. Interstate commerce also could be affected. The extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather. The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast officeshave 20% vacancy ratesafter Trump administrationjob cuts, twice that of just a decade ago. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday that the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days. “We expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,” he said. Flash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning. Hundreds of Kentucky roads across the state were impassable because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides. Downtown Hopkinsville, Kentucky, reopened in the morning after floodwaters from the Little River receded, giving a much-needed reprieve, but still more rainfall was on its way, Mayor James R. Knight Jr. said. “We got a little rain, but most of it went north of us,” Knight said. “Thank goodness on that. Gave us a little break.” In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed. In Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary due to widespread flooding. BNSF Railway confirmed that a railroad bridge in Mammoth Spring was washed out by floodwaters, causing the derailment of several cars. No injuries were reported, but there was no immediate estimate for when the bridge would reopen. Since Wednesday, more than a foot of rain (30.5 centimeters) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday. Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state’s emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding. In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities. Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage. “I grabbed all my stuff and came here,” said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: “I don’t leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed. I have to make sure I have them with me.” Schreiner reported from Shelbyville, Kentucky.

https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-hamas-war-security-corridor-f30c4514ea5635f7b32112b0acdf5905,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli troops deployed to a newly established security corridor across southern Gaza, the military announced Saturday, as pressure on the Hamas militant group increased weeks into the renewed war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday announced the new Morag Corridor and suggested it would cut off the southern city of Rafah, which Israel had ordered evacuated, from the rest of Gaza. A military statement said troops with the 36th Division had been deployed. It was not immediately clear how many, or where exactly the new corridor was located. Morag is the name of a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, and Netanyahu had suggested it would run between the cities. Maps published by Israeli media showed the corridor running the width of the narrow coastal strip from east to west. Netanyahu had said it would be “a second Philadelphi corridor,” referring to the Gaza side of the border with Egypt farther south, which has been under Israeli control since last May. Last month, Israel shattered a ceasefire in Gaza with a surprise bombardment after trying to pressure Hamas to accept proposed new terms for the truce that had taken hold in January. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed. Israel quickly reasserted control over the Netzarim corridor that cuts off the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, from the rest of the strip. The Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors run from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea. “We are cutting up the strip, and we are increasing the pressure step by step, so that they will give us our hostages,” Netanyahu said Wednesday. His defense minister has said Israel would seize large areas of Gaza and add them to its so-called security zones. Saturday’s announcement came shortly after a White House official confirmed that Netanyahu on Monday would again meet with President Donald Trump, their second meeting at the White House since Trump took office in January. The U.S. has been a mediator in ceasefire talks, along with Egypt and Qatar, but also supported Israel’s resumption of fighting. Following his previous meeting with Netanyahu, Trump made the surprise proposal that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the territory and he suggested that the United States take “ownership” in redeveloping the area. Palestinians, Arab nations and rights groups sharply criticized the idea. Israel has pledged to escalate the fighting with Hamas until the militant group returns the remaining hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war, disarms and leaves the territory. Israel last month again halted all supplies of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza in another application of pressure on the militant group and the territory’s over 2 million Palestinians. Rights groups say the tactic is a war crime. Gaza relies largely on humanitarian aid, and its residents cannot easily leave. Hamas says it will only release the remaining 59 hostages — 24 believed to be alive — in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory. The Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Some 251 hostages were taken, most of them released in ceasefire agreements and other deals. More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s offensive, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It doesn’t say whether they are civilians or combatants but says the majority have been women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. Among Gaza’s dead are 15 Palestinian medics killed last month by Israeli forces, who then bulldozed over the bodies along with their mangled vehicles, burying them in a mass grave. The war is the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas. It has left much of Gaza devastated and most of its residents displaced, often multiple times. Families of hostages at their weekly rally again pleaded for a ceasefire deal to bring everyone home from Gaza, alive or dead. “Netanyahu is working hard to ensure our hostages die, rather than working hard to save their lives,” said Efrat Machikawa, niece of hostage Gadi Moses. ___ Associated Press writer Fatima Hussein in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at ",Israel deploys troops to establish Morag Corridor across southern Gaza,Natalie Melzer,AP News,2025-04-05T12:12:04,2025-04-05T15:50:36,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/britain-carmakers-jlr-pause-ad5d4cfdca70975ab357e2cb5a8d698c,"LONDON (AP) — The maker of Jaguar and Land Rover cars is pausing shipments to the U.S. as Britain’s struggling auto industry begins to respond to the 25% tax on vehicle imports imposed by President Donald Trump. Jaguar Land Rover Automotive, one of Britain’s biggest carmakers, said Saturday that the pause would take place this month. “The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands,” the company said in a statement. “As we work to address the new trading terms with out business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.” Analysts said they expect other British carmakers to follow suit as the increased tariffs heap more pressure on an industry that is already struggling with declining demand at home and the need to retool their plants for the transition to electric vehicles. Related Stories “I expect similar stoppages from other producers as firms take stock of what is unfolding,” said David Bailey, an automotive industry expert and professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham. The number of cars made in the U.K. dropped 13.9% to 779,584 vehicles last year, according to the SMMT. More than 77% of those vehicles were destined for the export market. U.K. factories export cars such as Nissan’s Qashqai and Juke, BMW Mini, and Toyota Corolla, as well as Land Rover and Jaguar models. New cars are parked at Royal Portbury Docks, North Somerset, England, Friday April 4, 2025. (Ben Birchall via AP) “The industry is already facing multiple headwinds and this announcement comes at the worst possible time,” Mike Hawes, chief executive of the U.K.’s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said last week. “SMMT is in constant contact with government and will be looking for trade discussions to accelerate as we need to secure a way forward that supports jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.” U.K. carmakers have already taken steps to lessen the immediate impact of the tariffs by building stockpiles in the U.S. before the increase took effect. SMMT figures show that exports to the U.S. jumped 38.5% from a year earlier in December, 12.4% in January and 34.6% in February. “This was manufacturers like JLR trying to get ahead of the game in terms of getting inventory to the U.S. before the tariffs were implemented,’' Bailey said. British carmakers shipped 8.3 billion pounds ($10.7 billion) worth of vehicles to the U.S. in the 12 months through September, making cars the single biggest goods export to the U.S., according to government statistics. But cars make up a relatively small part of overall trade between Britain and the U.S., which is heavily weighted toward services. Britain exported 179.4 billion pounds ($231.2 billion) of goods and services to the U.S. in the year through September, with services making up 68.2% of that figure.",Jaguar and Land Rover maker pauses shipments to US as Trump's tariffs hit,Danica Kirka,AP News,2025-04-05T09:21:51,2025-04-06T04:20:11,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-india-china-modi-b0344b78d8e5c680567b5e057664a2d8,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated construction work on a solar plant in neighboring Sri Lanka and witnessed the signing of energy and defense agreements seen as efforts to consolidate New Delhi’s influence in the debt-stricken island nation. India has been concerned about China’s increasing presence in Sri Lanka, which is located on one of the world’s busiest shipping routes in what India considers part of its strategic backyard. Beijing has provided Sri Lanka with billions of dollars in loans for development projects. But Sri Lanka’s economic collapse in 2022 changed the country’s priorities and provided an opportunity for India, as New Delhi stepped in with massive financial and material assistance. At the same time, China’s support for restructuring its infrastructure loans is vital for Sri Lanka. Modi on Saturday held talks with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the two virtually inaugurated construction work on an Indian-funded 120-megawatt solar power plant, which is being built as a joint venture between the two countries. Sri Lanka faced a severe power shortage in 2022 after being unable to pay for oil and coal to power its electricity plants. It has also set ambitious goals of reducing its dependence on fossil fuel. Modi welcomed the agreements on defense cooperation and said both sides agreed to work together on security cooperation in the Indian Ocean through a regional grouping called the Colombo Security Conclave, which also includes Bangladesh, Maldives and Mauritius. “I am grateful to President Dissanayake for his sensitivity towards India’s interests. We believe that we have shared security interests. The security of both countries is interconnected and co-dependent,” Modi said. He said India has a special place for Sri Lanka in its “Neighbourhood First Policy” and has fulfilled its duties as a truly friendly neighbour when Sri Lanka was in difficulty. Modi was awarded “Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana,” the highest award presented to a foreign leader. Dissanayake said that he reiterated during talks with Modi that Sri Lanka’s territory will not be used for any acts that could harm India’s security and as well as the stability of the region. China plans to build a $3.7 billion oil refinery near Hambantota port, which was taken over by Beijing after Sri Lanka failed to pay back the loan to develop the port. It gives China a key foothold in the country directly opposite India’s coastline. Both India and China have separately agreed on terms with Sri Lanka for restructuring its debt, which would enable the country to come out from bankruptcy and rebuild the tattered economy. While the agreements were being signed, hundreds of protesters gathered opposite the capital Colombo’s main rail station, claiming the agreements were a betrayal of the country to Indian domination. Frontline Socialist Party, a radical splinter party of Dissanayake’s People’s Liberation Front, accused the president of backing down from his original stand on India. The leader of the party, Kumar Gunaratnam, said India had never been a genuine friend of Sri Lanka. Dissanayake’s party took up arms against a 1987 peace agreement between India and Sri Lanka but has since moderated its policy on its giant neighbor. India, which has its own sizable Tamil population, intervened in 1987 and signed an agreement with Sri Lanka to resolve Sri Lanka’s civil conflict. Some Tamil armed groups accepted the deal, the Tamil Tigers, the largest group, rejected it and continued to fight for separation.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-set-to-meet-trump-in-washington-on-monday-in-bid-to-reverse-tariffs/,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to visit the White House on Monday to discuss sweeping recently announced tariffs with US President Donald Trump, Israeli officials and a White House official said on Saturday. Netanyahu on Saturday night confirmed the visit, and his office said the two would also discuss “efforts to reach a hostage deal, Israel-Turkey relations, the Iranian threat, and confronting the International Criminal Court.” It will be Netanyahu’s fourth trip to Washington since the war in Gaza began and his second since Trump took office in January. The visit will also make Netanyahu the first foreign leader to negotiate in person with Trump over the US president’s sweeping new tariff policy, which included a 17% tariff on Israeli goods. “The prime minister appreciates the personal and warm relationship with President Trump,” said the statement from the premier’s office, “and thanks him for inviting him to be the first leader to meet with him after the imposition of global tariffs, just as he was also the first leader to meet with him after entering the White House.” Netanyahu will likely fly back to Israel from Washington on Tuesday morning. The surprise invite by Trump came in a phone call on Thursday with Netanyahu, who is presently on a visit to Hungary, when the Israeli leader raised the tariff issue, according to the Israeli officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The judges in Netanyahu’s ongoing criminal trial agreed to cancel Monday’s hearing so that he could fly to the US, but refused his lawyer’s request to cancel Wednesday’s hearing. A report on Saturday night said Israel fears that the US is “losing interest” in the hostage issue. Channel 12 said Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will be in Washington for the Netanyahu visit, and the Israeli hope is that negotiations can be revived. Backed by Witkoff, Israel has sought to secure an extended first phase of the deal signed in January under which more living hostages would be released, rather than entering the second phase of the deal, under which Israel would be obligated to end the war. In Budapest on Friday, a “senior official” on Netanyahu’s visit said it would be impossible to restart the war once Israel committed to ending it since Hamas would seek irrevocable guarantees, including a UN Security Council resolution. As regards Iran, the report said Israel is anxious to ensure that, with Trump declaring a readiness to negotiate a new deal designed to prevent Iran from attaining nuclear weapons, Israel’s essential interests would be taken into account. If there is no new negotiation, and with the US sending forces to the region, then Israel needs to coordinate with the US on a potential attack, the report said. Meanwhile, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on Friday that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken with Netanyahu “to underscore US support for Israel.” They discussed “the situation in Gaza and the Administration’s resolve to free the hostages in Gaza and recently announced tariffs,” Bruce said. Trump had also spoken with representatives from Israel, India and Vietnam to negotiate trade deals that could alleviate the proposed tariffs on those countries before the levies take effect next week, CNN reported Friday, citing a senior adviser. Netanyahu’s office did not comment on the call with Rubio or reported trade talks. Trump had told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday that Netanyahu “may very well be coming next week.” The US president also said he wants to “solve the Gaza problem” and hold direct talks with Iran over its nuclear program — even though Netanyahu thinks a new US-Iran nuclear deal is extremely unlikely and wants to discuss a potential strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, according to a senior Israeli official cited by Axios. According to the news site, Trump’s comment that Netanyahu could visit “next week” surprised Netanyahu and his office, as well as members of the US president’s own staff. Trump hadspokenhours earlier with Netanyahu and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, while Netanyahu was visiting Budapest. According to Netanyahu’s office, the conversation focused on Hungary’s withdrawal from the International Criminal Court and “the next steps that can be taken on this topic,” following the arrest warrants issued by the ICC in November against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza. During the call, Axios reported, Netanyahu brought up the new US tariffs, and Trump suggested the premier come to the White House to discuss them. A senior Israeli official had told reporters in Budapest on Friday that Netanyahu discussed the tariffs with Trump.Â	Â“I believe we will enter a dialogue with them, said the official. “In the end, most of it is solvable.” Trump’s 17% tariff on unspecified Israeli goods caught Jerusalem off guard. Earlier in the week, in a bid to forestall such a harsh penalty by Israel’s single largest trade partner, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich had scrapped all remaining tariffs on American imports. Netanyahu’s previous trip — the first by a foreign leader since Trump’s inauguration — came some two weeks after Israel and Hamas signed a ceasefire and hostage release deal. The deal was reached on January 19 — the day before Trump’s inauguration — some 15 months after the Gaza war was sparked on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages. The deal’s 42-day first phase expired on March 2 amid Netanyahu’s refusal to proceed to the second phase, which would have required a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war in exchange for Hamas’s release of all remaining living hostages, with Israel freeing large numbers of Palestinian terrorists and security prisoners. There are 59 hostages still held in Gaza, 35 of whom have been confirmed by Israel to be dead. Israel resumed hostilities in the Strip on March 18. Netanyahu has insisted the war end only once	Hamas’s governing and military capabilities had been demolished. Hamas, meanwhile, has rejected a series of US-backed offers to extend the first phase while continuing to gradually free hostages.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2z103nqxo,"Mobile phone footage has emerged that appears to contradict Israel's account of why soldiers opened fire on a convoy of ambulances and a fire truck on March 23, killing 15 rescue workers. The video, published by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), shows the vehicles moving in darkness with headlights and emergency flashing lights switched on - before coming under fire. The PRCS said the video was obtained from the phone of a paramedic who was killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially denied the vehicles had their headlights or emergency signals on. But in response to the new video, the IDF told the BBC: ""All claims, including the documentation circulating about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation"". A surviving paramedic previously told the BBC that the ambulances were clearly marked and had their internal and external lights on. The latest video, which the PRCS said had been shown to the UN Security Council, shows the marked vehicles drawing to a halt on the edge of the road, lights still flashing, and at least two emergency workers stepping out wearing reflective clothing. The windscreen of the vehicle being filmed from is cracked and shooting can then be heard lasting for several minutes as the person filming says prayers. He is understood to be one of the dead paramedics. The footage was found on his phone after his body was recovered from a shallow grave one week after the incident. The bodies of the eight paramedics, six Gaza Civil Defence workers and one UN employee were found buried in sand, along with their wrecked vehicles. It took international organisations days to negotiate safe access to the site. Israel claimed a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants had been killed in the incident, but it has not provided any evidence or further explained the threat to its troops. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar earlier this week echoed the army account, saying ""the IDF did not randomly attack an ambulance"". The IDF promised to investigate the circumstances after a surviving paramedic questioned its account. In an interview with the BBC, paramedic Munther Abed said: ""During day and at night, it's the same thing. External and internal lights are on. Everything tells you it's an ambulance vehicle that belongs to the Palestinian Red Crescent. All lights were on until the vehicle came under direct fire."" He also denied he or his team had any militant connections. ""All crews are civilian. We don't belong to any militant group. Our main duty is to offer ambulance services and save people's lives. No more, no less,"" he said. Speaking at the United Nations yesterday the President of the PRCS, Dr Younis Al-Khatib, referred to the video recording, saying: ""I heard the voice of one of those team members who was killed. His last words before being shot…'forgive me mum, I just wanted to help people. I wanted to save lives'. It's heartbreaking"". He called for ""accountability"" and ""an ""independent and thorough investigation"" of what he called an ""atrocious crime"". One paramedic is still unaccounted for following the 23 March incident. Gazan civilians are losing their fear of Hamas, openly criticising the group on the streets and online. Pope Francis had a close relationship with Gaza's tiny Christian community and used his last address to call for a ceasefire. An Israeli military report said ""professional failures"" led to the killing of the 15 rescue workers.

https://www.politico.eu/article/france-risks-missing-deficit-target-because-donald-trump-trade-war-minister-eric-lombard-says/,"PARIS —The trade war with the United States might prevent France from bringing down its sky-high budget deficit, French Economy and Finance Minister Eric Lombard said on Friday. ""Tax revenues would probably fall, and then GDP would fall compared to forecasts, which would worsen the deficit,"" Lombard said in an interview with BFMTV on Friday. U.S. President Donald Trump dumped the European Union in the worst category of America’s trade partners, hitting the bloc with a 20 percent tariff on all imports on Wednesday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has vowed to retaliate. Lombard said that if the trade war escalates and it has a negative impact on France's economic growth, the government plans to accept the fact that its deficit for this year will worsen and won't cut spending nor raise taxes to prevent that. “Even if the situation worsens, I don't want to further cut public spending,"" Lombard said, also excluding tax raises. France had aimed to bring its budget deficit to 5.4 percent of gross domestic product this year, down from 5.8 percent in 2024. The country is already facing an excessive deficit procedure in Brussels after breaching EU spending rules in 2023 that bar member states from running deficits of more than 3 percent of GDP.","France risks missing deficit target because of Trump’s trade war, economy minister says",Giorgio Leali,POLITICO,2025-04-04T09:56:53,2025-04-04T11:10:11,gemini-2.0-flash

 in return for a pact, officials say. BRUSSELS â

 At least a third of EU countries support a German-led plan to allow the U.K. and Canada to take part in a scheme for common purchases of weapons. EU ambassadors on Thursday discussed a plan to offer countries â

150 billion in cheap loans to spend on defense, but the Berlin-led effort to include the non-EU countries ran into opposition from France, which rejected Londonâ

’s participation.

“The French ambassador was quite vocal about this … he warned that would cause delays” to the scheme, said an EU diplomat who, like others quoted in this story, was granted anonymity to speak freely.

France is determined to secure more advantageous fishing rightsÂ
 in return for a U.K.-EU defense deal, according to several officials.

The Security Action For Europe (SAFE) loan plan is part of a broader package that includes exempting defense spending from EU budget limits set and channeling private funding toward the defense industry.

The thorniest issue, however, is whether the U.K., Canada and the U.S. would be allowed to take part in joint purchases under the initiative. According to the Commission’s initial framework, they are out as they do not have a defense deal with the EU.

The proposal limits joint procurement to Ukraine, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, as well as countries vying to join the EU and those with a security and defense partnership with Brussels.

A group of around 10 countries including Germany, Netherlands and Sweden supported opening the joint procurement scheme to the U.K. and Canada.

“We all agree on what should be done: more openness. But there are different approaches on how to get there,” said an EU diplomat.

https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-eu-defense-fund-arms-investment-procurement/,"BRUSSELS — British officials met select European allies at a discreet dinner in Brussels last week to hatch plans for a new defense fund designed to sidestep the European Commission, keep a lid on public debt and rearm faster. The off-the-books gathering brought together senior finance ministry officials from Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom to float the idea of creating a supranational bank specifically for the purpose of jointly buying weapons and slashing the cost of defense procurement, according to officials familiar with the matter. The secret gathering was hosted by Poland, according to one EU official, granted anonymity to speak freely about the confidential discussions, like others quoted in this story. At the center of the pitch was a proposal from the U.K. Treasury, detailed in a discussion paper seen by POLITICO, that would allow participating governments to avoid booking the upfront capital cost of military kit in their national budget, which would be of huge benefit to countries with tight spending rules. With President Donald Trump distancing the U.S. from the protection of Europe as he warms ties with Russia, governments are scrambling to rapidly increase investment in defense, and in many cases aim to go beyond NATO's target of spending 2 percent of economic output. However they have a delicate balance to strike because of self-imposed restrictions on public spending. “The British have a fiscal straightjacket so they are very much interested in this,” said a government official familiar with the dinner. Circumventing the European Commission The scheme would allow the new fund to directly purchase weapons on behalf of members — a power the EU's lender, the European Investment Bank, currently lacks — aiming to tap a dedicated pool of investors comfortable with backing the defense sector. “We wouldn’t be under the control of the Commission and that’s also why it is attractive,” said another EU diplomat. The specialized nature of the fund would, in theory, also improve loan conditions. “As a purely defense sector-focused institution, it would be able to target a specific investor base comfortable with financing the defense sector, rather than try to persuade ESG-conscious investors to add defense sector assets to their portfolio,” says the document. European officials, however, are not convinced the savvy financial engineering will necessarily be enough to convince Southern European countries — including France, Italy, and Spain — to drop their preference for Commission-backed grants funded by joint EU borrowing from capital markets. Countries like Spain and Italy fear that taking on additional debt domestically for defense could hurt their market ratings and spook investors. “I don’t see the Southerners interested in this mechanism, but they are interested in grants,” the EU official said. “I’m not sure if they are yet on the same page.” Northern states, by contrast, are reluctant to support any plan that draws on mutualized debt. Baltic countries and non-EU states such as Norway could be interested in joining the British scheme, but some officials fear moving ahead without Southern European states will risk widening the defense gap in Europe, since the latter are already underspending on defense. Nifty engineering The British-led initiative stands in direct competition with a European Commission plan to offer a €150 billion loan package to support joint defense procurement — a plan that currently excludes the U.K., which since Brexit has not signed a security agreement with the EU. Compared to the EU's current initiatives, London's scheme engineers a fiscal advantage for governments by shifting the “upfront capital cost of purchasing” military equipment to the new institution's balance sheet, freeing up theirs. Governments would instead only be liable for debt interests and maintenance costs. That structure, officials added, is tailored to appeal to states under geopolitical pressure — particularly those near Russia — as fears grow over renewed aggression from Moscow and the prospect of U.S. military disengagement under Donald Trump. Still, key questions remain unanswered, including how the proposed institution would be governed or who would ultimately make decisions — a critical detail given the aim of operating outside the Commission’s remit. The U.K. isn’t the only one eyeing alternatives, however. Poland, currently holding the EU Council presidency, has asked the Bruegel think tank to draw up its own version of a “rearmament bank,” which will be discussed at an informal finance ministers’ gathering in Warsaw on Saturday. “That shows the appetite to look into a mechanism like this,” said a second EU diplomat.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/greece-launches-drastic-rearmament-programme-to-the-tune-of-27bn,"A multi-year strategy will include a balance of US and European weapons, marking a transition towards greater EU autonomy. Athens, Greece â	â	Greece on Wednesday became the first European Union member to take advantage of relaxed spending rules for defence, announcing a 25bn-euro ($27bn) multi-year rearmament programme. The centrepiece of the programme was a multi-layered defence system called the Shield of Achilles, which Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told parliament was â	essentially a dome combining existing air defences with new systems, offering protection on five levels â	 anti-missile, anti-ballistic, anti-aircraft, anti-ship, anti-submarine and anti-droneâ	. It was Greeceâ	â	first multi-year, comprehensive rearmament, and was part of a broader overhaul of the armed forces called Agenda 2030. Mitsotakis described the shift as the â	most drastic transformation in the history of the countryâ	â	armed forcesâ	. As the world is changing at an â	 unpredictable paceâ	, he said, â	We are now facing a different kind of war than we were used to â	 at least the kind our armed forces were prepared for.â	 Greece is a consistent high defence spender due to its adversarial relationship with Turkiye, and is this year set to spend 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence. That is significantly above the European average of 1.9 percent, as estimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Amid a Russian war in Europe and contentious United States fidelity to NATO, the EU last monthdecided to raiseup to 650bn euros ($705bn) in off-the-books additional defence spending. Europeâ	â	 total defence spending in 2023 was $569bn. The EU also offered member states 150bn euros ($163bn) in low-interest loans to strengthen European defence industries. Front-line states Greece and Poland fought hard for the relaxed fiscal rules, and Mitsotakis went further in parliament. â	The Greek government believes that at some point Europe needs to create a fund focused on shared [defence] benefits such as a European anti-missile shield that will cover all European countries and can be funded by European grants to member states, not loans. But we are not there yet,â	 Mitsotakis said. Mitsotakisâ	â	 reasoning was that Brussels could raise money more cheaply than most individual member states, so underwriting collective debt was more cost-effective than borrowing individually. The EU issued its first mutualised debt during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, creating a 730bn-euro ($805bn) stimulus fund. Its 150bn-euro ($165bn) rearmament fund, called Security Action for Europe (SAFE) is made of money left over in that fund. Greece has traditionally bought mostly US weapons, but its bankruptcy in the post-2008 global financial crisis has catalysed a more pro-European trajectory. Years of austerity halved its defence budget to $4.6bn by between 2010 and 2014. Meanwhile, Turkiyeâ	â	 economy and defence budgets grew. As it rearmed on carefully balanced budgets, Greece decided to replace quantity, where it could no longer compete with Turkiye, with quality, and sought more sophisticated weapons systems. The US did not oblige, wanting to maintain a balance between its two east Mediterranean allies, so Greece migrated towards European systems Turkiye did not have. That helped make it an early convert to the cause of European strategic autonomy championed by Franceâ	â	 President Emmanuel Macron. In September 2019, Greece announced it would buy 18 French Rafale fighter-bombers for $2.5bn, and raised that number to 24 a year later. In 2021, Greece penned a strategic defence treaty with France, ordering three state-of-the-art Belharra frigates from Franceâ	â	 Group Naval for 2.26bn-euro ($2.5bn), with an option for a fourth. PM Mitsotakis hailed the agreement in parliament as the cornerstone of an independent European defence policy. â	The defence of European interests in the Mediterranean now acquires new substance,â	 Mitsotakistoldparliament four years ago. â	If attacked, our country will have at its side the most powerful military on the continent, the sole European nuclear power.â	 All 24 Rafales were delivered in record time, and the first frigate, originally laid down for the French navy, is to be delivered this year. The Belharra carry French-made weapons and radar from MBDA, Thales and Dassault. Those include the Aster-30 hypersonic, surface-to-air missiles, capable of travelling at four and a half times the speed of sound and striking aircraft, drones and guided ballistic missiles, MU90 torpedoes, the latest 200km-range (124-mile) Exocet antiship missiles and the Thales Sea Fire radar. The Rafale also carry French weapons, including 100km-range (60 mile) Meteor air-to-air missiles and 500km-range (310 mile) air-to-surface Scalp EG missiles. Last September, Greek Minister of National Defence Nikos Dendias said the second, third and fourth Belharra frigates would also carry the SCALP Naval strategic missile, with a range of more than 1,000km (620 miles). None of these weapons have been sold to Turkiye, although the United Kingdom, a part of the MBDA consortium, now seeks to sell the Meteor missile to Ankara. â	After 1976, we had the 7:10 rule,â	 said Angelos Syrigos, a professor of international law at Panteion University in Athens, referring to a US pledge to supply Greece and Turkiye according to fixed proportions. â	That permeated all systems. In recent years this has changed. We donâ	â	seek a proportionality but a qualitative edge. The SCALP and Meteor missiles are qualitative advantages on the Greek side,â	 he told Al Jazeera. A top priority for Greece is to build up its own defence industrial base, and 12 percent of the Belharra contracts go to Greek companies. Dendias said he aimed to put Greek companies in a consortium building the European Patrol Corvette as well. But Greece is not turning its back on the US. In 2018, Greece penned a $1.3bn deal with the USâ	â	Lockheed Martin to upgrade 85 of its F-16 fighter jets to Viper level, installing advanced radar and weapons systems on board. Last year it ordered 20 fifth-generation F-35 planes from Lockheed Martin, and wants Greek companies to co-develop the next-generation US Constellation frigate. â	Greece is obliged to balance between the US and Europe in defence, because that better consolidates its position,â	 Konstantinos Filis, a professor of international relations at the American College of Greece, told Al Jazeera. â	It cannot be one-track. And the EU and US also need Greece, because itâ	â	 in an area of strategic interest to both.â	 Follow Al Jazeera English:",Greece launches ‘drastic’ rearmament programme to the tune of $27bn,John T Psaropoulos,Al Jazeera,2025-04-03T11:34:03Z,2025-04-03T11:34:03Z,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/04/05/asia-pacific/politics/australia-darwin-port-china/,"Sydney – Australia plans to buy back control of its strategic northern port of Darwin from the current Chinese leaseholder, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said. China's Landbridge group was granted a 99-year lease on the port in 2015, a widely criticized decision that led to stricter scrutiny of major infrastructure sales. The port is the closest to Australia's Asian neighbors and a base for U.S. Marines who rotate in and out of the country. ""We want it to be in Australian hands,"" Albanese told public broadcaster ABC radio Friday, describing the port as a ""strategic asset."" The government preferred that an Australian firm acquire the port lease, and it had held informal talks with potential buyers including Australian pension funds, he said. But it was also prepared to intervene and use taxpayers' money to make it a state asset. Albanese, who faces a general election on May 3, said Landbridge had not invested sufficiently in the port to ""bring it up to scratch."" The prime minister said his center-left Labor Party had long criticized the lease as ""short-sighted for economic reasons, but also for national security reasons."" ""You would recall at the time it was criticized by (then-U.S.) President (Barack) Obama as well — gave the Australian government a rebuke at the time."" Obama reportedly complained Washington had not been told in advance of the deal. Albanese said he would have ""more to say"" about the port lease before the election. His government had said in 2023 it would not cancel Longbridge's lease after a review into the national security risks found no reason to vary or cancel the agreement.","Australia to buy Darwin port lease from Chinese firm, PM says",AFP-JIJI,The Japan Times,2025-04-04T21:13:03,2025-04-06T03:40:55,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250405001300320,"SEOUL, April 5 (Yonhap) -- Hyundai Motor Co. will freeze prices of all new vehicles sold in the United States through early June, a move aimed at easing consumer concerns over rising costs following Washington's imposing of 25 percent duties on all imported vehicles, the automaker's American subsidiary said. Hyundai Motor America (HMA) said in a press release Friday (U.S. time) that any new Hyundai vehicle purchased until June 2 will be protected from Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) increases regardless of changes in market conditions under the company's Customer Assurance program. Washington's measure of imposing 25 percent tariffs on imported cars went into effect this week, part of U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive drive to reduce America's trade deficits and bolster domestic manufacturing. ""We know consumers are uncertain about the potential for rising prices and we want to provide them with some stability in the coming months,"" Jose Munoz, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Hyundai Motor, said. ""Our MSRP commitment is just one part of our multifaceted effort to provide great vehicles to American consumers."" Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, said the price protection measure builds on Hyundai's March and first-quarter sales momentum and reflects the company's ""legacy of supporting American consumers and investing in the U.S. market."" Hyundai Motor added that the MSRP freeze is part of its broader U.S. strategy, which also includes a US$21 billion investment plan from 2025 to 2028 aimed at expanding manufacturing and technology operations and creating more than 100,000 jobs.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250404002700315,"SEOUL, April 4 (Yonhap) -- South Korea and the United States have recently agreed on a plan to temporarily deploy Patriot missile defense batteries from the South to the Middle East, sources said Friday, amid speculation over a potential shift in the role of the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK).

The allies agreed last month on the ""monthslong"" partial deployment of the Patriot Advanced Capability-3, the first known case involving the relocation of USFK assets to the Middle East, according to the sources.

The missiles work alongside South Korea's own air defense assets in a multilayered missile defense system against North Korea's missile and nuclear threats, according to the sources.

The rare move comes after U.S. broadcaster NBC News reported last week that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized at least two Patriot missile defense batteries from Asia to be moved to the Middle East as the U.S. takes military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels.

But it also comes amid growing concerns here that Washington may demand that Seoul further shoulder the cost of the upkeep of the USFK or reconsider the role of U.S. troops in South Korea as U.S. President Donald Trump takes a ""transactional"" approach to alliances.

The USFK reaffirmed its ironclad commitment to the Korean Peninsula, without providing further details, citing internal policy, when asked about the latest deployment.

""USFK will temporarily deploy personnel and equipment from the Republic of Korea as part of a rotational deployment,"" it said in a statement. ""USFK will still maintain a ready, capable, and lethal force on the Korean peninsula prepared to respond to any contingency.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/4/israel-has-turned-two-thirds-of-gaza-into-no-go-land-un-says,"The latest displacement orders in Rafah and Gaza City have forced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee again. Israel has now restricted Palestiniansâ	M access to roughly two-thirds of Gaza, either by declaring large areas as no-go zones or issuing forced displacement orders, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Among the restricted areas is a large swath of southern Rafah, where Israelâ	Ms military issued a new displacement order on March 31, declaring it was returning to â	Mcfight with great forceâ	M. The restrictions also cover parts of Gaza City, where Israeli troops launched anew ground offensiveon Friday morning to expand their â	Msecurity zoneâ	M. These escalations have triggered one of the largest mass displacements of the war, pushing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians â	M many already displaced multiple times â	M to flee yet again. â	MOur biggest struggle now is displacement,â	M Abu Hazem Khalef, an elderly man displaced from Gaza Cityâ	Ms east, told Al Jazeera. â	MWe have no idea how to handle this situation. Iâ	Mm heading west of Gaza City, looking for any street where I can set up a tent.â	M â	MWe are being forced to leave and we donâ	Mt even know where to go,â	M added Mahmoud al-Gharabli, another displaced Palestinian. â	MWe are exhausted and completely broken.â	M The military push follows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ	Ms threat to intensify the offensive to pressure Hamas into further concessions. â	MWe are now dividing the Strip and we are increasing pressure step by step so they will give us our hostages,â	M Netanyahu said in a video message on Wednesday. On Friday, Israeli forces continued devastating aerial attacks, killing at least 38 people, medical sources told Al Jazeera. This followedan intense day of bombardmenton Thursday that left 112 dead â	M many of them women and children. Conditions inside Gaza Cityâ	Ms al-Ahli Hospital, also known as the Baptist Hospital, where manyvictimsin the north were taken, are â	Mnothing short of apocalyptic,â	M Al Jazeeraâ	Ms Hani Mahmoud said after visiting the facility. â	MWe are seeing bodies laid on the ground and they are counted in the 10s,â	M Mahmoud said. â	MWeâ	Mve seen doctors, they are helpless. They donâ	Mt know what to do. They are unable to save lives given the dire situation inside the hospital.â	M Israel resumed its attacks in Gaza on March 18, shattering a two-month ceasefire after talks with Hamas broke down over the next phase of the agreement. Netanyahu wants Hamas to release the 59 remaining Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and aid, but without Israel committing to end the war or pull out troops. For a final ceasefire deal, Netanyahu insists Hamas must disarm â	M a demand the group calls a â	Mred lineâ	M â	M and has openly backed plans for Israel to seize security control of Gaza and push Palestinians out. Hamas calls for a return to thepreviously agreed three-stage ceasefire frameworkand has offered to free all the captives at once in return for a permanent ceasefire.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-iran-pulling-forces-out-of-yemen-amid-intensive-us-airstrikes-on-houthis/,"Iran has reportedly ordered its military personnel to leave Yemen and is pulling back its support for the Houthis amid extensive US airstrikes on the rebel group. The British Telegraph newspaper on Thursday cited a “senior Iranian official” saying that Tehran is scaling back its support of its regional proxies to focus on the direct threats emanating from the US administration. “Every meeting is dominated by discussions about [US President Donald Trump],” the official was quoted as saying. According to the official, Iran’s pullback from Yemen was designed to avoid the possibility of escalation if an Iranian soldier is killed in US airstrikes there. Tehran is focusing its efforts instead on how to respond to Trump and his litany of threats, and “none of the regional groups we previously supported are being discussed,” the official said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories “The view here is that the Houthis will not be able to survive and are living their final months or even days, so there is no point in keeping them on our list.” “They were part of a chain that relied on Nasrallah and Assad, and keeping only one part of that chain for the future makes no sense,” the official continued, referring respectively to the former leaders of the Hezbollah terror group and Syria. A handout picture provided by the office of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei shows him greeting Mohammed Abdulsalam (L), spokesman for Yemen’s Houthi movement, in Tehran on July 30, 2024. (Iranian Supreme Leader’s Website) The Telegraph report came amid a US aerial campaign agains the Houthis that has seen near-daily strikes in rebel-held areas of Yemen since March 15. The strikes are aimed at stopping the Iran-backed group from attacking commercial shipping in solidarity with the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas. Washington has since said it is sending a second aircraft carrier group to Middle East waters to bolster its campaign to “deter aggression and protect the free flow of commerce.” The Houthis had halted their attacks on shipping during a six-week ceasefire in Gaza earlier this year, but they announced they were resuming them after Israel cut off aid to the territory before returning to fighting against Hamas. Since then, the Houthis have launched drone and missile attacks on both US warships and Israel. On Thursday, the Houthis said a strike they blamed on the United States killed a guard at a communications tower, among more than 30 strikes on rebel-held parts of Yemen. “An American aggression targeted the communications network in… Ibb governorate, leading to the martyrdom of Abdulwasim Abdulwahab Zahir, the communications tower guard,” Houthi health ministry spokesman Anees Alasbahi said on social media. People assess the damage following reported overnight US strikes that Houthi rebels said hit the Water Management building in Mansouriya in Yemen’s Hodeida governorate, on April 2, 2025. (AFP) Earlier, the Houthis’ Al-Masirah television said more than 20 strikes had hit Saada province, the rebels’ stronghold in the northern mountains. It said Washington had carried out two strikes on vehicles, one south of the rebel-held capital Sanaa and another in Saada province. In a video statement, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said the United States had launched “over the past few hours more than 36 air strikes” in different parts of the country. Saree said the group had targeted US aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman in response.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-widens-ground-operation-in-northern-gaza-kills-senior-hamas-official-in-lebanon/,"The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that it had expanded its ground operations in the northern Gaza Strip, with troops pushing into Gaza City’s eastern Shejaiya neighborhood. According to the military, the operations are aimed at expanding Israel’s buffer zone along the Gaza border. The IDF said that so far, troops have killed several terror operatives and destroyed infrastructure, including a Hamas command center. The military said it is enabling civilians to evacuate the area “for their safety.” It had issued evacuation warnings for Shejaiya on Thursday. Israel had issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of ground operations. The UN humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the ceasefire with Hamas fell apart last month. Throughout the war, the IDF has issued evacuation orders for various areas, advising residents to head for safe zones to avoid being caught up in the fighting. Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields by embedding its fighters among the population. In an update later on Friday, the military said that a deputy commander of a Hamas Nukhba force company was killed in a recent drone strike in the northern Gaza Strip. The strike was directed by troops of the 401st Armored Brigade. The brigade killed several more operatives and destroyed rocket launchers and other Hamas infrastructure during their operations in northern Gaza, the IDF said. Gaza’s civil defense agency said Friday that military operations had killed at least 30 people in the Palestinian territory since dawn, adding that the toll was “not final.” The figures cannot be verified. A single Israeli strike on Khan Yunis killed at least 25 people, a medical source at the southern city’s Nasser Hospital told AFP. “The situation is very dangerous, and there is death coming at us from every direction,” Elena Halas told AFP via text message, adding that she and her family were trapped in her sister’s house in Shejaiya. A number of the Palestinians leaving the targeted areas in northern Gaza Thursday did so on foot, with some carrying their belongings on their backs and others using donkey carts. “My wife and I have been walking for three hours covering only one kilometer,” said Mohammad Ermana, 72. The couple, clasping hands, each walked with a cane. “I’m searching for shelters every hour now, not every day,” he said. Israel restarted intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 and then launched a new ground offensive, ending a nearly two-month ceasefire in the war with Hamas. The war erupted on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists rampaged through southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages to Gaza. Hamas-controlled health officials said on Thursday that 1,163 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the large-scale strikes resumed, bringing the overall death toll since the war began to 50,523. The toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. Israel says it killed at least 20,000 combatants and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced earlier in the week that troops would carve out a new security corridor that will seemingly cut off Rafah as it seeks to pile pressure on Hamas, which continues to hold 59 Israeli hostages. IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Thursday that the military has begun a “new stage” in the operation designed to return the hostages and destroy “Hamas’s military and governing capabilities.” Meanwhile, a senior Hamas commander was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the coastal Lebanese city of Sidon overnight, the military announced. Hassan Farhat had headed Hamas’s forces in the western sector of Lebanon, according to the IDF. The Israeli airstrike had hit an apartment building in Sidon. During the war, the military said, Farhat advanced numerous attacks on Israeli civilians and IDF troops, and was responsible for a rocket attack on the Northern Command base in Safed on February 14, 2024, killing Staff Sgt. Omer Sarah Benjo and wounding other troops. “The terrorist was involved in advancing terror attacks against the State of Israel in recent months, and his activities constituted a threat to the State of Israel and its citizens,” the IDF said. Footage from the scene of the strike showed one floor of the apartment block in flames, with smoke pouring out of it. The other floors appear to be relatively unscathed. Reports of a precision-airstrike earlier by the Israeli Air Force, on an apartment building inside the city of Sidon in southern Lebanon. Reports that the target eliminated in Sidon was a senior Hamas official. It is also reported that his family was eliminated along with him. Hamas has a significant presence in Lebanon and is allied with the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group. Both are backed by Iran. In February, an IDF strike killed another senior Hamas commander in Sidon. Israel accused him of plotting and advancing terror attacks from Lebanon against Israeli civilians, with Iranian funding and guidance. Under the November ceasefire with Lebanon, which ended over a year of Hezbollah-instigated fighting, the terror group was obligated to pull its forces north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the Israeli border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south, while the Lebanese army deployed to control the area. Israel, meanwhile, was obligated to withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon within 60 days. The withdrawal deadline was pushed off, with Lebanese and US approval, to February 18. Israel eventually withdrew from all of Lebanon except for five strategic posts along the border. Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly accused each other of violating the agreement, which gives Israel the right to act against imminent threats by terror groups.","IDF widens ground operation in northern Gaza, kills top Hamas official in Lebanon","Emanuel Fabian, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-04-04T07:30:35,2025-04-04T07:30:35,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/eu-goes-hunting-for-central-asias-mineral-riches-at-samarkand-summit/,"SAMARKAND, UZBEKISTAN – With access to rare metals and critical minerals on their minds, a number of top EU leaders are travelling to Samarkand to meet with Central Asian presidents in a glittering palace on the outskirts of this ancient crossroads city. Central Asian leaders invited the European Union with a mix of enthusiasm and caution to gather on Thursday and Friday in Samarkand, situated along the historic Silk Road trade routes which now serves as Uzbekistan's host city for major diplomatic meetings The aim is to “significantly strengthen ties”, said the EU's ambassador to Uzbekistan, Toivo Klaar. Among the few announcements expected at the summit itself is the the creation of a European Investment Bank office in Tashkent, and plans for a European investment forum to be held in Uzbekistan before the end of the year. A “Samarkand declaration” that will reflect “the common aspiration of the parties to establish a strategic partnership” is also expected at the summit. Talks will touch on issues including connectivity, the environment and security as this year's EU focus considerably shifts to critical minerals. In this part of Eurasia, which has long been seen as a backwater by many in the EU, has seen a renewed interest from the West since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which upended long-standing economic relations and led Europeans to reconsider their geopolitical position. The landlocked former Soviet republics in Central Asia – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – are strategically significant, with governments still close with Moscow and much courted by Beijing. Russian firms have used the region as a base for efforts to circumvent Western economic sanctions. Europeans are seeking to strengthen their influence with Central Asian governments for this reason. But efforts to secure supplies of important minerals, and Europe's urgent need to diversify energy supplies, are also key motivations. This is what Brussels is actively seeking, as the EU currently depends almost entirely on China for supplies of those resources. In March, the European Commission unveiled a plan to revive mining, including projects in third countries, less than a year after EU legislation aimed at securing the supply of critical raw materials came into force. ""We see the EU is very interested in Central Asia,"" said Han Ilhan, a consultant and board advisor to the Uzbekistan Technological Metals Complex. ""Many projects are being discussed right now.” Central Asia could become something like the El Dorado of European dreams. The 34 critical raw materials identified as needed by the EU – including cobalt, copper, tungsten, lithium and nickel – are present in large quantities in the Central Asian subsoil. “It's a little-known region, yet all the Central Asian countries are among the top 10 richest in terms of ores and rare earths, varying by type of material, with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan ahead of the pack,” said Roman Vakulchuk, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. “The investment climate is not very favourable, so we are not yet seeing a rush of Western rare metals western mining companies into Central Asia. But it won't be long,” said a French diplomat in Kazakhstan. The diplomat pointed in part to the absence of international standards in the mining sector in Central Asian countries. That hasn't stopped some European firms from plunging into the region. Germany's HMS Bergbau AG is implementing a joint project to exploit lithium deposits in eastern Kazakhstan. In November, Astana and Paris signed a roadmap for a strategic partnership in the field of critical resources and materials that runs through 2026. The deal should enable French companies to penetrate the Kazakh geological market as early as this year. At the EU level, Commissioner for External Partnerships Joseph Síkela signed a €3 million partnership agreement with Kazakhstan on critical raw materials and rare earths on March 13. Last May, Uzbekistan signed a memorandum of understanding with the EU for the same sector. The EU may have arrived late to Central Asia. China has been interested in its neighbours' underground resources for over a decade, and Chinese fims already hold most of the licenses and mining sites in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The majority of critical mineral exports from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are currently reserved for Beijing. Russia, for its part, has for decades largely secured its uranium needs from the region, which the Kremlin regards as its strategic ""near abroad"". The region is also economically dependent on Moscow for many infrastructure projects. On the other hand, the rush for critical metals in Central Asia has not gone unnoticed by other newcomers such as the United States, Canada and South Korea, all of which have recently signed major deals with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. ""Despite its fine words, the European Union is only involved in two or three projects in Central Asia. That's very little and very slow, even though it has been interacting with these governments for decades,"" Vakulchuk said, pointing out that rare metals are not mentioned in the EU's 'Global Gateway' strategy until 2023. But the region is still heavily dependent on Russia and China, which remains a sensitive issue. “We see from Central Asia a wish to deepen relationships with the EU and diversify their foreign policy,” one top EU official said. As the Samarkand summit approaches, European interest seems to have been appreciated – but has been greeted with caution, with no statement from Central Asian republics suggesting that the EU will play a greater role in the region.

https://www.dw.com/en/nato-members-seek-assurances-at-summit-amid-us-tariffs/a-72126524,"Foreign ministers from NATO member statesmet in Brussels on Thursday just hours after US President Donald Trump sparked anger among allies with a new sweeping round of tariffs. Relations between the US and its NATO allies in Europe as well as Canada have been tense
since Trump came to office pledging to impose tariffs over what he called unfair trade balances. There have also been fears that the US will pull its forces out of Europe, especially after comments by high-level figures in the Trump administration. But on Thursday, ahead of the meeting, NATO chief Mark Rutte sought to assuage these fears, saying there would be no ""sudden"" withdrawal of US forces from Europe. ""There are no plans for them to all of a sudden draw down their presence here in Europe,"" Rutte, the former Dutch prime minister, said. He went on to say that the US had to ""attend to more theaters than one."" Rutte sidestepped a question about what he thought the reaction would be to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also attending the summit. ""The focus here of all 32 [NATO members] is how to defend NATO territory against the Russians, our long-term threat, which will be there even after, I hope there will be a deal on Ukraine,"" Rutte told journalists. Asked whether he thought the US was still a trustworthy ally in NATO, Rutte said ""Absolutely, they are."" For his part, Rubio said that NATO members should increase their defense spending to 5% of GDP ahead of the talks. ""We do want to leave here with an understanding that we are on a pathway, a realistic pathway, to every single one of the members committed and fulfilling a promise to reach up to 5% of spending. That includes the US,"" he said. 
In an attempt to show Washington's continued commitment to the alliance, Rubio said the US was ""as active as it has ever been."" Edited by: Wesley Dockery",NATO members seek assurances at summit amid US tariffs,Alex Berry,Deutsche Welle,2025-04-03T11:49:48,2025-04-03T19:47:28,gemini-2.0-flash

Pak In-chol, chairman of the North's SPA, met with the delegation led by Kazbek Taysaev, secretary of the Russian Communist Party's central committee, at Mansudae Assembly Hall the previous day and held talks ""in a friendly atmosphere,"" the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. Also present at the meeting were Ri Chol, president of the Academy of Medical Science under the public health ministry and chairman of the North Korea-Russia friendly parliamentary group, and Russian Ambassador Alexandr Matsegora, the KCNA said, without further elaboration. The delegation arrived in Pyongyang on Monday in the latest of a series of high-level exchanges between the countries. They are ramping up cooperation in a range of sectors, including the military, economy and public health following the signing of a mutual defense treaty last June between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko was reported as saying last week that preparations were underway for a visit by Kim to Russia.

Bombing nuclear infrastructure would have catastrophic consequences for the entire world, Zakharova says, adding that Iran has the right to peaceful nuclear energy. Iran claims that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful and denies seeking a nuclear weapon, but has ramped up its enrichment of uranium up to 60 percent purity, the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so, and has obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities.

https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-giorgia-meloni-coalition-war-in-ukraine-eu-rearmament-donald-trump/,"Europe's massive rearmament plans — and the EU's role in Ukraine — are turning into a splitting political headache for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni as she grapples to hold her right-wing coalition government together. As leader of the EU’s No. 3 economy, Meloni, a committed transatlanticist, is conspicuously not buying into more gung-ho rhetoric from France and Germany that Europe’s time has come to build global heavyweight militaries and to replace America as the main guarantor of Ukraine’s security against Russia. In part, Meloni’s caution on European rearmament reflects her sincere belief that Rome should not be making a binary choice about siding with the EU against U.S. President Donald Trump. But there’s also a significant domestic political calculus at play. On Meloni's right flank, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini is seeking to revive his political fortunes by playing to widespread voter skepticism about a major peacekeeping role within Ukraine (only 6 percent of Italians think that’s a good idea, polls suggest), as well as to broad concern over the effect of increased military spending on Italy's already squeezed finances. Meloni doesn't want to be seen as being pulled toward a warzone by the ambitions of Paris and Berlin. The prime minister's challenge is that her coalition has to balance the interests of the far-right League party of Salvini, an admirer of Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, with those of another major partner, the center-right Forza Italia party of her other deputy, Antonio Tajani, who is far more pro-European and has even publicly supported a European army. While Meloni's government is unusually stable by Italian standards, she has to contain the sparring between Salvini and the EU-oriented Tajani. The two have clashed over the idea of a European army, with Salvini even scoffing that such a force should never be led by ""madman"" French President Emmanuel Macron. These political strains are most discernible in Meloni’s shifting rhetoric over the past weeks. She has downplayed her previous confidence that Ukraine will achieve victory, raised serious doubts about the EU's plans to rearm, and poured cold water on the prospect of European countries going it alone without U.S. firepower. ""I don't think I have used the word 'victory' with respect to the war in Ukraine,"" Meloni told the Italian parliament last month, contradicting her earlier stance. She went on to denounce one of the European Union's founding texts and to decry the ""childish"" false dichotomy between Europe and Brussels, and continued to push a controversial idea that would see NATO security guarantees extended to Ukraine without the country joining the alliance. Her EU-friendly allies in the ruling coalition insisted in remarks to POLITICO that Meloni remains a committed European at heart and that her recent comments were mostly about throwing a bone to Salvini. But the big question is whether she has nevertheless underestimated the extent to which Trump is truly turning his back on Europe. “The way Trump has acted these past two months, how can you act as a mediator?” asked Giovanni Orsina, professor of contemporary history at Luiss University in Rome. “And now she risks going from being friends with both sides, to becoming an enemy of both.” Rearmament reticence While she is still committed to Europe, Meloni's change in rhetoric does reflect Rome's genuine skepticism of the pace and scale of the EU's rearmament plans, according to Italian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to speak freely.  The main issue is the European Commission's proposed bloc-wide rearmament plan, which would consist of €150 billion in cheap loans and greater fiscal flexibility of up to €650 billion for countries that don't have enough fiscal headroom. Italy has pushed for more private sector involvement in the rearmament plan, which it fears would otherwise lead to a surge in borrowing costs at a time when it is under EU orders to shrink its exorbitant debt pile. | Gints Ivuskans via Getty Images According to two people familiar with the government's position, Rome is aware that it is weaker and smaller than France and Germany, and has a more realistic view of Europe's undeveloped defense sector and its limited chances against Russia without the U.S., whose extensive supply chains are deeply interwoven with the bloc's military capabilities. As POLITICO reported last month, Italy has also pushed for more private sector involvement in the rearmament plan, which it fears would otherwise lead to a surge in borrowing costs at a time when it is under EU orders to shrink its exorbitant debt pile. Like the United Kingdom, Italy's close relationship with the U.S. has reduced its dependence on its European neighbors, said one person familiar with the thinking in Rome, adding that the country does not want to be at the ""mercy"" of France and Germany should the transatlantic alliance fall apart. While France has ""always had a cold relationship with the United States ... no Italian government has ever questioned the relationship with the U.S. on defense,"" Italian General Leonardo Tricarico, who was military advisor to several prime ministers, told POLITICO. After Italy's defeat in World War II, added the person quoted above, ""we learned forever that there is not a place for us as a global superpower. We can play a role everywhere in the world, but we can do it only if we are together with the U.S. Certainly we must also do it within the EU — but not only within the EU."" A transatlantic breakup would also make it harder for both Europe and the U.S. to tackle China, the official added. Allies are seemingly already aware of Italy's discomfort. In an interview with leading Italian daily Corriere della Sera over the weekend, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sought to reassure Rome that its leading defense firm, Leonardo, would ""benefit greatly"" from the defense spending push and play a significant role in a rearmed Europe. On top of that, the latest update to the EU rearmament plans — which includes provisions for private-sector financing — already goes some way toward appeasing Rome's concerns. But none of that is likely to reassure Meloni fully. In the view of Stefano Stefanini, a former top Italian diplomat and NATO ambassador, Meloni's actions also reflect a faith, perhaps misplaced, that the transatlantic alliance can still be saved, and that its demise has been exaggerated. Center-left lawmaker and former European Affairs Minister Enzo Amendola agreed, telling POLITICO that the premier's reconciliation efforts would leave Italy in a ""no man's land between the EU and the U.S."" Nevertheless, it's a view shared by Italians across the political spectrum.""I doubt there will ultimately be a complete rupture between the United States and the European Union,” said Danilo Della Valle, an MEP with the left-populist 5Star Movement. European rearmament is, after all, what Trump is asking for, he added.  One of the people familiar with the government’s thinking went so far as to argue that tensions with the U.S. were being exploited by opportunistic French and German leaders — and that a rearmed Germany was actually more dangerous than Russia or the U.S. A spokeperson for the Italian government declined to comment. Coalition clashes But such geopolitical concerns are ultimately outweighed by local ones for Meloni, particularly Salvini's increasing inclination to veer off-piste.  The firebrand's star has been overshadowed by Meloni in recent years, and a League congress in Florence next month threatens to expose deep divisions within the party's own ranks. As a result, Salvini is taking pains to display his populist credentials and revive support among his flagging base, and has drawn criticism for unilaterally engaging with the U.S. administration — including an unauthorized call with Europe-hating Vice President JD Vance last month — and for his repeated calls for Meloni not to back the EU defense plans. Geopolitical concerns are ultimately outweighed by local ones for Giorgia Meloni, particularly Matteo Salvini's increasing inclination to veer off-piste. | Pierre Teyssot via Getty Images To be sure, Salvini is unlikely to blow up the coalition anytime soon, having learned the risks of political showboating after his disastrous exit from a coalition government with the 5Star Movement in 2019, League Senator Claudio Borghi told POLITICO. The politician added that Meloni’s shift on Ukraine has largely appeased League lawmakers, and that the premier — if forced to choose — would attempt to deal with the U.S. bilaterally, as Rome sought to do during Trump's previous term.  But even as Meloni scrambles to reclaim her territory on the right, her recent actions also suggest she may be feeling out pro-European alternatives to the garrulous Salvini, according to Francesco Galietti, a former Treasury official and founder of the political risk consultancy Policy Sonar. Over the weekend Meloni caused some surprise by praising her centrist political rival Carlo Calenda, who leads the small Azione party that is broadly loathed by the far-right — and is a vocal supporter of EU rearmament. ""This is her hedge against Salvini,"" argued Galietti. At an Azione conference, Meloni denied she was looking into a formal alliance with Calenda, even if the quasi-endorsement of the EU-friendly leader was a reminder of her own continued support for the bloc. But as Trump's shadow looms large, the limits of that support are being sorely tested. ""If she comes to a point where she has to choose between supporting and not supporting Ukraine, she's too committed to Ukraine to drop it,"" said Stefanini, the diplomat. ""But she will try to avoid making any choice — as long as she can."" ",Italy’s Meloni strains to hold her coalition together over Ukraine and EU rearmament,"Ben Munster, Elena Giordano, Giovanna Faggionato",POLITICO,2025-04-02T22:17:00,2025-04-06T14:21:18,gemini-2.0-flash

Hungary’s government, led by right-wing populist Orbán, extended the invitation to Netanyahu in November after the ICC, based in the Hague, Netherlands, issued the warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity. Orbán, a close Netanyahu ally, has called the arrest warrant “outrageously impudent” and “cynical.” Member countries of the ICC, such as Hungary, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that and relies on states to comply with its rulings.",Hungary plans to withdraw from International Criminal Court as Netanyahu arrives despite warrant,,AP News,2025-04-03T08:15:41,2025-04-03T04:15:41,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/argentina-britain-falklands-war-history-anniversary-memorial-veteran-8c5e25dc6b68b838c7ac2f04a9c7857b,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina’s libertarian President Javier Milei on Wednesday marked the anniversary of his nation’s failed 1982 attempt to forcibly wrest the Falkland Islands from Britain by expressing hope that the island’s residents may one day choose to be Argentine rather than British. Milei’s speech came as a surprise to many in Argentina, which still claims sovereignty over the British-controlled archipelago that it calls Las Malvinas despite the British victory. His comments were criticized as overly conciliatory by political rivals who argue that the island’s residents have no right to self-determination because they are not an Indigenous people. “We hope for the Malvinenses (Falkland Islanders) to one day decide to vote for us with their feet,” Milei said at a ceremony commemorating Argentina’s 74-day war over the South Atlantic territory that killed 649 Argentine service members and 255 British soldiers. “That’s why we seek to be a power, to the point that (the islanders) prefer to be Argentine.” The island’s roughly 3,000 residents most recently voted to remain a British overseas territory in a 2013 referendum — a result rejected by then-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a left-leaning populist who made Argentina’s claims to Las Malvinas a centerpiece of her foreign policy. As president and more recently vice-president over the last decade, Kirchner repeatedly condemned U.K. control over the islands as a colonial holdover and sought to press Britain to enter talks about the future of the territory that it has ruled since 1833. On Wednesday, Kirchner and her political allies — ideological opponents of the right-wing president — castigated Milei for his accommodating approach to Britain. “There is no self-determination after the occupation and expulsion,” former Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero wrote on social media platform X in reaction to Milei’s speech, accusing him of “surrendering” the nationalistic claims for which Argentines fought and died. Even politicians from the center-right PRO party expressed confusion over Milei’s stance on an issue that long has forged a unifying sense of Argentine patriotism. During Milei’s 2023 presidential campaign, the former TV pundit set off a firestorm by admitting that he idolized fellow libertarian Margaret Thatcher, the U.K. prime minister who dispatched troops to retake the Falklands after Argentina’s waning military dictatorship mounted its invasion. Eager to quiet mounting controversy on Wednesday, Cabinet officials insisted that Milei’s remarks constituted no change of policy. “Milei wasn’t just referring to self-determination, he was saying that we will not cease efforts at any table or forum,” Defense Minister Luis Petri told local journalists who peppered him with questions from the memorial plaza after Milei’s speech. The war’s 43rd anniversary also exposed tensions within the highest rungs of government. Victoria Villarruel, Milei’s vice-president and a fiery advocate for Argentina’s military whose father fought in the 1982 war, flew over 2,800 kilometers (1,700) miles to Argentina’s chilly southernmost coast on Wednesday to lead a separate memorial ceremony. Villarruel took the stage in Ushuaia — from which Argentine troops first set off to recapture the islands — to shouts of “Long live the homeland!” shortly after a local veteran affairs official delivered a speech condemning Milei’s remarks on self-determination. “Our country must define a clear and unambiguous policy of national defense,” Villarruel said, her voice rising.",Argentina's President Milei draws pushback over his Falklands War speech,ISABEL DEBRE,AP News,2025-04-02T18:59:48,2025-04-02T14:59:48,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250403006200320,"SEOUL, April 3 (Yonhap) -- President Yoon Suk Yeol has decided not to appear before the Constitutional Court for his impeachment ruling later this week, his legal team said Thursday. The Constitutional Court has said it will deliver its ruling on Yoon's impeachment over his short-lived martial law bid at 11 a.m. Friday. The decision was made in consideration of public order and security concerns, as congestion is expected, the legal team said. Yoon was impeached by the National Assembly on charges of violating the Constitution and laws through his brief imposition of martial law on Dec. 3. Yoon has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the declaration was meant as a warning to the main opposition party for what he described as its abuse of legislative power. Under the Constitution, the consent of at least six justices is required to uphold an impeachment motion. There are currently eight justices on the bench. President Yoon Suk Yeol (L) talks with his lawyer, Yun Gap-geun, during the 10th hearing of his impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Feb. 20, 2025, over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/top-news/modi-leaves-for-thailand-sri-lanka-says-visit-to-bolster-ties-benefit-region-101743646746990.html,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday left for a four-day visit to Thailand and Sri Lanka to participate in the Bimstec Summit in Bangkok and to bolster relations with the two countries. Modi departed hours after US President Donald Trump slapped what he said were 26% “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on Indian exports to the US, and a formal Indian response is expected from the commerce ministry, people familiar with the matter said. TheThailandleg of the visit will be watched closely for a possible encounter or meeting between Modi andBangladeshinterim government chief Muhammad Yunus. People familiar with planning for the trip had earlier said a formal meeting is unlikely, but the Bangladesh side has made a strong push for a meeting over the past few days. In a statement ahead of his departure, Modi said he expected the visits to build on foundations of the past and contribute to strengthening India’s close relationships for the benefit of the wider region. He said he was travelling to Thailand at the invitation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to attend the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) Summit. Over the past decade, Bimstec has emerged as a “significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region”, he said. Noting that India’s northeastern region lies at the heart of Bimstec, Modi said he would meet leaders of the grouping and engage “productively to further strengthen our collaboration”. Since India stymied the activities of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) by pulling out of a summit to be hosted by Pakistan in 2016, it has focused on Bimstec – which includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand – as a platform for driving regional cooperation. A maritime cooperation agreement is expected to be signed during the Bimstec Summit in Bangkok on April 4. Modi will also have bilateral meetings with Shinawatra and the Thai leadership to bolster relations between the two countries. He will hold talks with Shinawatra on Thursday evening before participating in a dinner hosted by the Thai premier for the Bimstec leaders. Following the summit on Friday, Modi will meet Thai King Vajiralongkorn. Modi will travel from Thailand to Sri Lanka on Friday evening. This trip follows the visit of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to India last December. “We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of ‘Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future’ and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,” Modi said. The people said India and Sri Lanka are expected to sign up to 10 agreements during the visit, including a crucial pact to refresh defence cooperation for the first time since the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) intervention during the island nation’s civil war in the late 1980s.","Modi leaves for Thailand, Sri Lanka, says visit to bolster ties, benefit region",Rezaul H Laskar,Hindustan Times,2025-04-03T07:54:47,2025-04-03T07:54:47,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-thailand-earthquake-a5ce6c6bd211eba0df4a1e0bf6808a43,"BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s ruling military declared a temporary ceasefire in the country’s civil war Wednesday to facilitate relief efforts following a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that has killed more than 3,000 people. The surprise announcement by military leaders who also head the unelected government came late Wednesday on state television MRTV, which said the halt in fighting would run until April 22 to show compassion for people affected by Friday’s quake. The announcement followed unilateral temporary ceasefires announced by armed resistance groups opposed to military rule, and the military warned that those groups must refrain from attacking the state and regrouping, or else face “necessary” measures. The resistance forces have also reserved the right to fight in self-defense. Earlier Wednesday, rescuers pulled two men alive from the ruins of a hotel in Myanmar’s capital, a third from a guesthouse in another city, and another in the country’s second city, Mandalay, five days after the quake. But most teams were finding only bodies. The quake hit midday Friday, toppling thousands of buildings, collapsing bridges and buckling roads. The death toll rose to 3,003 on Wednesday, with more than 4,500 people injured, MRTV reported. Local reports suggest much higher figures. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports China says a relief convey in Myanmar has arrived at its destination. The quake worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis due to Myanmar’s civil war. More than 3 million people had been displaced from their homes and nearly 20 million were in need even before it hit, according to the United Nations. In the capital, Naypyitaw, a team of Turkish and local rescue workers used an endoscopic camera to locate Naing Lin Tun on a lower floor of the damaged hotel where he worked. They pulled him gingerly through a hole jackhammered through a floor and loaded him on to a gurney nearly 108 hours after he was first trapped. Shirtless and covered in dust, he appeared weak but conscious in a video released by the local fire department, as he was fitted with an IV drip and taken away. State-run MRTV reported later in the day that another man was saved from the same building, more than 121 hours after the quake struck. Both were age 26. Another man, a 47-year-old primary school principal, was rescued by a team of Malaysian and local crews from a collapsed guesthouse in the Sagaing township, near the epicenter of the earthquake close to Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, where a fourth rescue was reported Wednesday night. The earthquake also rocked neighboring Thailand, causing the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok. One body was removed from the rubble early Wednesday, raising the death total in Bangkok to 22 with 35 injured, primarily at the construction site. Myanmar’s military seized power in 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into significant armed resistance. Ceasefires had been announced earlier this week by the People’s Defense Force, which is the armed wing of the shadow opposition National Unity Government, and the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a trio of ethnic minority guerrilla armies. That had put pressure on the military government to follow suit, said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies. It’s too early to say whether a pause in fighting could lead to something longer lasting, he said. “It would require very deft and active diplomacy to transform a humanitarian pause into something more lasting. And that’s not guaranteed,” Morgans said. The military government was particularly vulnerable to bad publicity this week because its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, was expected for a high-profile visit to a regional conference in the Thai capital Thursday. It will be his first to a country other than his government’s main supporters and backers — China, Russia and Russia ally Belarus — since he attended another regional meeting in Indonesia in 2021. Min Aung Hlaing and other senior leaders are shunned and sanctioned by many Western countries for their 2021 takeover and human rights abuses as they try to crush the resistance to their rule. Before Wednesday’s ceasefire announcement, an opposition militia belonging to the Brotherhood Alliance reported that the military fired on a relief convoy of nine Chinese Red Cross vehicles late Tuesday in the northern part of Shan state. The Ta’ang National Liberation Army said that the Chinese Red Cross was bringing supplies to Mandalay and had reported its route to the military. But Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the military government, said that the convoy hadn’t notified authorities of its route ahead of time, MRTV reported. While not mentioning the Red Cross, he said that security forces had fired into the air to deter a convoy that refused to stop. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun didn’t comment on the attack. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was looking into the matter. Countries have pledged millions in assistance to help Myanmar and humanitarian aid organizations with the monumental task ahead, while also sending in specialist search and rescue teams and setting up field hospitals. India and China, both neighbors of Myanmar that compete for influence there, have been especially quick and generous with assistance. Multiple other countries have sent teams, including Turkey, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia. The U.S. government has pledged $2 million in emergency aid and sent a three-person team to assess how best to respond given drastic cuts to U.S. foreign assistance. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that continuing aftershocks are complicating humanitarian response efforts. In Mandalay City, many people are completely cut off from electricity and running water. “People affected continue to need urgent healthcare and medical supplies, safe drinking water, food and other critical items,” Dujarric said. “Tents and temporary shelter are needed, as well as latrines and other hygiene items, to prevent disease outbreaks.” Most of the details so far have come from Mandalay, which was near the epicenter of the earthquake, and Naypyitaw, about 270 kilometers (165 miles) north of Mandalay. Many areas are without power, telephone or cellphone connections, and difficult to reach by road, but more reports are beginning to trickle in. In Singu township, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Mandalay, 27 gold miners were killed in a cave-in, the independent Democratic Voice of Burma reported. In the area of Inle Lake, a popular tourist destination northeast of the capital, many people died when homes built on wooden stilts in the water collapsed in the earthquake, the Global New Light of Myanmar reported. ___ Matthew Lee in Washington, Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Jintamas Saksornchai and Grant Peck in Bangkok contributed to this report.","Myanmar's military declares a ceasefire to ease quake relief as deaths pass 3,000",DAVID RISING,AP News,2025-04-02T07:25:39,2025-04-02T03:59:49,gemini-2.0-flash

Yesterday, Sa’ar said that during his Paris visit he will focus on “the challenges and threats of the radical axis in this region to all of us, mainly Iran.” The foreign minister will also address “the situation in Gaza and the hostages, as well as bilateral relations” between Israel and France, according to today’s statement. Sa’ar will also meet with senior officials in the French government and with French Jewish community leaders, the Foreign Ministry adds. Earlier today, Sa’ar met with Secretary-General of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Mathias Cormann, and stressed that regional stability is tied to “defeating the radical axis led by Iran,” including preventing Iranian nuclear development and US attacks on the Iran-backed Houthis, “who harm the freedom of navigation and international trade,” according to a statement from Sa’ar’s office.","Sa’ar flies to Paris to meet with counterpart on Iran, regional threats",Nava Freiberg,The Times of Israel,2025-04-02T14:19:37,2025-04-02T15:09:54,gemini-2.0-flash

https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Natural-disasters/United-Nations-urges-ramp-up-in-aid-to-earthquake-hit-Myanmar,"BANGKOK (Reuters) -- United Nations officials who surveyed earthquake damage in Myanmar urged the global community on Tuesday to ramp up aid before the looming monsoon season worsens already catastrophic conditions, with the death toll at 2,719 and expected to surpass 3,000. Drinking water, hygiene, food, shelter and medicine are the most critical needs following extensive damage to buildings, roads and bridges, said Marcoluigi Corsi, acting humanitarian and resident coordinator following a two-day visit. ""We remain, of course, deeply committed to reaching people in Myanmar who need aid,"" U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. ""And we must act swiftly to provide relief before the upcoming monsoon season, which, of course, will even worsen this horrendous crisis."" A civil war in Myanmar had displaced more than 3 million people long before the quake struck. U.N. Special Envoy for Myanmar Julie Bishop urged all sides to immediately cease fire, permit humanitarian access and ensure aid workers are safe. ""Continuing military operations in disaster-affected areas risks further loss of life,"" she said in the statement. Aid groups in Myanmar warned that the window to find survivors was closing fast. Myanmar's military ruler Min Aung Hlaing said the death toll from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake reached 2,719 as of Tuesday morning and was expected to surpass 3,000. Some 4,521 people were injured and 441 missing. ""Among the missing, most are assumed to be dead. There is a narrow chance for them to remain alive,"" he said in a speech. The quake, which struck at lunchtime on Friday, was the strongest to hit the Southeast Asian country in more than a century. It toppled ancient pagodas and modern buildings alike and inflicted significant damage on Myanmar's second city Mandalay and Naypyitaw, the capital the previous junta purpose-built to be an impregnable fortress. U.N. agencies said hospitals were overwhelmed and rescue efforts hindered by infrastructure damage and the civil war. Rebels have accused the military of conducting airstrikes even after the quake and on Tuesday a major rebel alliance declared a unilateral ceasefire to help relief efforts. The earthquake was the latest in a succession of blows for the impoverished country of 53 million people following a 2021 coup that returned the military to power and devastated the economy after a decade of development and tentative democracy. Myanmar's military has been accused of widespread atrocities against civilians as it fought to quell a multi-pronged rebellion after the coup. It has dismissed the accusations as misinformation and says it is protecting the country from terrorists. In neighboring Thailand, the death toll from the quake rose to 21 on Tuesday, with hundreds of buildings damaged. Rescuers kept searching for life in the rubble of a collapsed skyscraper under construction in the capital Bangkok, but acknowledged time was against them. The region has been hit by five more aftershocks. Julia Rees of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF said she witnessed entire communities in Myanmar that had been flattened, with immense destruction and psychological trauma. ""And yet, this crisis is still unfolding. The tremors are continuing. Search and rescue operations are ongoing. Bodies are still being pulled from the rubble,"" she said in a statement. ""Let me be clear: the needs are massive, and they are rising by the hour. The window for life-saving response is closing."" In the Mandalay area, 50 children and two teachers were killed when their preschool collapsed, the U.N. humanitarian agency said. In a rare survival story, a 63-year-old woman who was trapped for 91 hours was pulled from the rubble of a building in Naypyitaw on Tuesday in a joint rescue effort by the Myanmar fire department and teams from India, China and Russia. Myanmar's civil war has complicated efforts to reach those injured and made homeless, including tight controls over the internet and communication networks. The Three Brotherhood Alliance of three major rebel groups at war with the junta on Tuesday declared a unilateral one-month ceasefire, to allow urgent humanitarian efforts to ""be carried out as swiftly and effectively as possible"". In its nightly news bulletin on Tuesday, state-controlled MRTV quoted Min Aung Hlaing as saying the military had halted its offensives but unspecified ethnic minority armies were planning to exploit the disaster. ""The military is aware they are gathering, training, and preparing to attack,"" it said, quoting the general as saying at an event to raise funds for quake victims. ""We consider it as attacking us and will respond accordingly."" One rebel group, the Karen National Union, on Sunday said the junta had conducted airstrikes in the east of the country at a time when it should be prioritizing quake relief efforts. Amnesty International said it had received testimony corroborating reports of air strikes near areas where quake recovery efforts were focused. ""You cannot ask for aid with one hand and bomb with the other,"" said Amnesty's Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman. It was unclear if Min Aung Hlaing would make a rare foreign trip this week to attend a regional summit in Bangkok as planned. Thailand's on Tuesday said the general may attend by teleconference. In Bangkok, rescuers were still seeking signs of life in the ruins of an unfinished skyscraper that collapsed, aware that four days after the quake, chances had dimmed of finding survivors. Fourteen deaths have been confirmed at the site and seven elsewhere in the city. The government is investigating the collapse and initial tests showed some steel samples from the site were substandard. There were an estimated 70 bodies under the rubble and experts said 12 had been located using scanners, but access was blocked by large debris. ""Maybe they can survive one week or two weeks, so we have to go on,"" Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said. ""The experts still have hope.""",United Nations urges ramp-up in aid to earthquake-hit Myanmar,Staff Writer,Nikkei Asia,2025-04-01T21:21:12,2025-04-01T21:21:12,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/mexico-security-trump-sheinbaum-lopez-obrador-ddb4d905e38bab9b9a1560df28a06331,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Six years ago Mexico’s president disbanded the country’s Federal Police and handed security responsibilities fully to the military. Now, his successor has quietly begun to build an elite civilian investigative and special operations force to fight the drug cartels. President Claudia Sheinbaum had already shown a willingness early in her presidency to move away from former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s oft-criticized “hugs, not bullets” strategy. It focused on addressing the social roots of crime rather than directly confronting Mexico’s powerful cartels. Sheinbaum’s security chief, Omar García Harfuch, is drawing on his law enforcement contacts — mostly from the former ranks of the Federal Police — to claw back security capabilities from the armed forces with a civilian force under his direct command. The government has yet to formally announce the new National Operations Unit, known by its Spanish initials UNO, but its existence is an open secret among former members of the Federal Police, where García Harfuch started his career. Three Mexican officials, all of whom requested anonymity to speak about the still unannounced force, confirmed its existence to The Associated Press. Security analyst David Saucedo, who has spoken with people who have joined the force, said he believes García Harfuch’s main objective is to have an armed force that allows him to meet demands from Washington. UNO takes shapeThe unit began to form shortly after Sheinbaum took office and it hopes to have 800 members by the end of the year, said one federal official, who is familiar with many of the unit’s details. On Monday, while García Harfuch was in Washington meeting with the Trump administration, the security ministry published a call for college graduates to make up “the first generation of investigative and intelligence agents,” saying only they would be part of a specialized group to strengthen the country’s security. UNO will have three branches distributed geographically across Mexico, as well as a high-impact team that will be the “elite of the elite,” the federal official said. Its current members are mostly former Federal Police and members of the special operations team García Harfuch created when he was Mexico City’s police chief. Most have previously received training from security forces from the United States, Colombia, Spain or France. His challenge is rebuilding the trust of his U.S. counterparts after López Obrador limited U.S. agents’ movements in Mexico and do it as President Donald Trump pressures Mexico to step up the fight against fentanyl trafficking. A controversial pastShortly after taking office, López Obrador replaced the Federal Police with a new force, the National Guard, that he sold to the public as civilian, but that was always led by and made up of the armed forces. He lambasted the Federal Police as too corrupt to save and made Mexico’s former security chief Genaro García Luna, then facing trial in the U.S. and eventually convicted of working for the Sinaloa cartel, the poster child. He cut funding for training and equipping local police. What followed were six years of what critics decried as militarization that effectively concentrated unprecedented authority in the hands of the armed forces. Despite that, levels of violence remained stubbornly high and critics said the cartels grew stronger, fueled by soaring revenue from fentanyl. One of the main criticisms of the National Guard and military was that while they had numbers and fire power they did not have the investigative skills needed to dismantle large criminal organizations. García Harfuch was initially a “toothless tiger,” who was frequently denied resources, information and investigative files by other security entities, said Saucedo, based in Guanajuato state, Mexico’s most violent. UNO puts an elite force under his direct command. The Mexican federal official denied that UNO’s objective was to satisfy Trump, but noted the unit was involved in the unprecedented delivery of 29 high-profile cartel figures to the United States at the height of negotiations between the two countries to suspend threatened tariffs. They were pulled out of prisons all over Mexico, assembled and sent to the U.S. without incident. The challenge: avoid corruptionSpecial operations forces, be it from the Navy, Army, Federal Police or state police, have a checkered history in Mexico, having been involved in many scandals and abuses of power, extrajudicial killings and infiltration by cartels. “There have been a lot of cases that were bad,” said the previously quoted federal official, who added that there were also honest police. He said the security ministry is emphasizing stricter screening, exhaustive background investigations and better pay once they’re in. García Harfuch’s influence also extends to states where Sheinbaum’s party holds power. People he trusts are taking key security positions and UNO will train state special operations teams that are also made up of many former Federal Police. The southern state of Chiapas, where Mexico’s most powerful cartels are battling for control of smuggling routes, announced a special operations force in December called the Pakal with some 500 members. Two members told the AP they were ex-Federal Police and did eight months of specialized training to join the Pakal. But doubts remain. For Saucedo, since the new elite force doesn’t yet have effective internal controls and accountability mechanisms, “there’s no guarantee that this elite group won’t commit the excesses committed by other special operations groups.” ___ Associated Press writer Edgar H.

https://www.rferl.org/a/brussels-foreign-ministers-rubio-nato/33365613.html,"On April 3-4, NATO foreign ministers will gather in Brussels for their regular spring meeting. Much like at the defense ministerial in February, all eyes will be on the American representative. Then, it was Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth; this time, it's Secretary of State Marco Rubio. When Rubio was first slated for the role in the new Trump administration, most Europeans rejoiced. He was seen as an ardent ""transatlanticist."" Now, there is a certain nervousness, according to the NATO diplomats I have spoken to. While some say, ""He still gets us and the alliance,"" they wonder what influence he really has within the US government and what he will say when it comes to Ukraine, Russia, and China. Two things, however, are apparent. Just like Hegseth, Rubio will hammer home the message that European allies need to step up on defense spending and burden sharing. And, just like in February, the allies will hope that the United States reconfirms its commitment to NATO and its mutual defense clause, Article 5. Since the only other NATO gatherings before the alliance's June summit are an informal foreign ministers' meeting in Turkey in mid-May and a defense ministers' session in early June, this week's meeting serves very much as a dress rehearsal for the summit in The Hague on June 24-26. The goal for that meeting is clear: Keep the alliance together by considerably ramping up defense spending. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte is pushing for every ally to commit to spending at least 3.7 percent of gross domestic product on defense as quickly as possible and with regular progress reports. This push is aimed at placating US President Donald Trump at the summit, but some European allies will be reluctant to commit too much on defense too soon given they are struggling with low growth and ballooning budget deficits. Will Rubio Snub The EU's Kaja Kallas Again? Perhaps the one thing to look for during the ministerial is the session devoted to NATO-EU relations, with the latter represented by the European bloc's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas. Rubio snubbed Kallas when she traveled to the United States earlier this year, and all EU diplomats I have spoken to admit that Washington doesn't see the EU as a serious interlocutor. There is also plenty of tension, not least when it comes to the European Commission's latest defense spending proposal: a potential 150 billion euro ($163 billion) loan for EU member states to buy arms, though not from non-European countries. The United States is especially wary of any moves that would lock it out of a European defense-spending splurge. But the biggest irritant, of course, is the fraying relationship on trade. Just one day before the NATO meeting, the United States is set to impose a 25 percent tariff on all vehicle imports, a move that will hit countries like Germany especially hard. This follows existing US duties on European steel and aluminum, which Brussels is planning to counter with retaliatory measures on April 13. Will The US Ramp Up Pressure On Russia? Another guest at the ministerial is Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha. An update on the situation on the battlefield is expected but, again, it will be Rubio who is in the spotlight. Will the United States increase pressure on Russia in case the cease-fire deals concerning infrastructure and Black Sea traffic aren't holding? While Ukraine's membership in NATO is off the table for now, most European allies are keen to at least get assurances that US weapons will continue to go to Ukraine and that NATO's training mission for Ukrainian soldiers, NSATU, continues to operate. So far, everything is still working. There also haven't been any changes when it comes to US troop posture on NATO's eastern flank. From Dayton To Riyadh: Can Shuttle Diplomacy End The Ukraine War? What has changed, however, is that the United States is no longer chairing the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, known as the Ramstein group, which coordinates military support for Kyiv. The United Kingdom already chaired the last meeting of the group in February, and the next one tentatively scheduled for April 11 could be co-chaired by the UK and France. Expect London and Paris to also continue working, at least on the sidelines of the ministerial, on a potential reassurance force in Ukraine should a permanent cease-fire take hold. However, details such as troop numbers, participating countries, and the exact mandate will have to remain sketchy for now. What's become increasingly apparent is that work on a new NATO strategy for Russia has stalled. The strategy -- defining how the alliance should engage with Moscow going forward -- was supposed to be endorsed at the Hague summit. But Washington has indicated that it wants to avoid introducing potential ""irritants"" on the path to a final peace deal, and such a strategy document could be exactly that. Finally, the foreign ministers of NATO's four Asia-Pacific partners -- Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea -- will also be participating in a session at the explicit request of the United States. While the US administration sees Beijing as a rival, its public criticism of China has so far been relatively muted. In this session, ministers will be keen to hear Rubio's comments on how to approach a range of China-related issues.","At Brussels Foreign Ministers Summit, All Eyes Will Be On Marco Rubio",Rikard Jozwiak,RFE/RL,2025-04-01T18:44:55,2025-04-01T18:44:55,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.rferl.org/a/hungary-israel-netanyahu-iccc-arrest-warrant/33366535.html,"When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Hungary, it is virtually certain he will not be detained despite an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged war crimes in Gaza. As a signatory to The Hague court, Hungary has an obligation to arrest him, but its domestic legal situation is complicated and has given the government enough wiggle room to welcome him. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban publicly extended an invitation to Netanyahu in November shortly after the ICC issued the warrant. The Israeli leader was scheduled to arrive on April 2 for a four-day visit. ""I will guarantee him, if he comes, that the judgment of the ICC will have no effect in Hungary,"" Orban said. Meanwhile, diplomatic sources inside Hungary told RFE that the country had decided to withdraw from the ICC, though this could not be immediately confirmed officially. What Are The Political Reasons? The politics of all this are clear. Orban has closely aligned himself with Netanyahu and with US President Donald Trump, who has also criticized the court's warrant. Trump issued sanctions against the ICC last month, criticizing as ""baseless"" its arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto welcomed the decision with a social media post, accusing the ICC of being a ""political tool."" The indictment says Netanyahu is ""allegedly responsible for the war crimes of starvation as a method of warfare and of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024."" Hungarian Family Lives Under Constant Threat In Village That Proclaims Itself 'Roma Free' What's The Legal Position? The legal situation is more complex. The court cannot arrest anyone; rather, it relies on countries who have signed onto the treaty creating the court -- the Rome Statute -- to enforce its warrants. ""It is not for states to unilaterally determine the soundness of the court's legal decisions,"" court spokesman Fadi El-Abdallah told RFE He said it was a ""legal obligation to the court"" to enforce them. This view was endorsed by two senior lawyers who spoke to RFE ""If Mr. Netanyahu visits a state party like Hungary or Germany and is not arrested, this state violates its obligations under the Rome Statute of the ICC,"" said Kai Ambos, professor of criminal and international law at Germany's Goettingen University. ""The nonexecution of ICC arrest warrants undermines the court's legitimacy,"" said Ambos, who serves as a war crimes judge at the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, an international court set up for crimes committed during the 1990s Kosovo conflict. Tamas Adany, an associate professor of international law in Hungary, agreed with this but also pointed to a nuance. ""Globally speaking, there are countries where, whenever they ratify an international treaty, it becomes part of the law of the land,"" he said. ""Most other countries, where the typical language of multilateral treaties is not an official language…rely on a process called promulgation"" to make an international obligation part of national law, he said. What's Fueling Protests In Georgia, Hungary, Romania, And Serbia? Hungary ratified the Rome Statute in 2001 under the first Orban government. But it has never carried out the second step, which basically amounts to incorporating the statute into the country's own national legal code. ""The question is hard because Hungary is under a legal obligation from the perspective of international law to comply with this. But Hungarian national law does not make it possible for the authorities [to do so],"" Adany said. This reasoning has also been used by the Hungarian authorities. ""Thanks to former President Janos Ader, we had the sense to never make it part of domestic law,"" government spokesman Gergely Gulyas said on March 13. Yet Adany said the law was not entirely clear on this point, because Netanyahu is accused of crimes that have been considered part of customary international law since the 1940s. ""I'm very positive that those parts of the Rome Statute, which are considered by a majority of states to be customary international law in nature, should be enforced in Hungary even without a formal promulgation,"" he said. Is Hungary Alone? Gulyas pointed to another reason for not arresting Netanyahu. When the court warrant was issued, Germany offered an ambiguous response. ""I find it hard to imagine that we would make arrests on this basis,"" government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said, adding that legal questions had to be clarified about the warrant. Then, in January, Christian Democrat leader Friedrich Merz said he would find ""ways and means"" to invite Netanyahu to Germany. Merz's party subsequently won federal elections, and he is now preparing to take office as the country's next chancellor. Gulyas, the Hungarian government spokesman, seized on this.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36718p52eyo,"President Vladimir Putin has called up 160,000 men aged 18-30, Russia's highest number of conscripts since 2011, as the country moves to expand the size of its military. The spring call-up for a year's military service came several months after Putin said Russia should increase the overall size of its military to almost 2.39 million and its number of active servicemen to 1.5 million. That is a rise of 180,000 over the coming three years. Vice Adm Vladimir Tsimlyansky said the new conscripts would not be sent to fight in Ukraine for what Russia calls its ""special military operation"". However, there have been reports of conscripts being killed in fighting in Russia's border regions and they were sent to fight in Ukraine in the early months of the full-scale war. The current draft, which takes place between April and July, comes despite US attempts to forge a ceasefire in the war. There was no let-up in the violence on Tuesday, with Ukraine saying that a Russian attack on a power facility in the southern city of Kherson had left 45,000 people without electricity. Although Russia has turned down a full US-brokered ceasefire with Ukraine, it says it did agree to stop attacking Ukraine's energy facilities. In an apparent attempt to deny Moscow had broken the terms of that deal, Russian officials said they had told Putin that Ukrainian drones had carried out attacks with little sign of a break. Russia calls up conscripts in the spring and autumn but the latest draft of 160,000 young men is 10,000 higher than the same period in 2024. Since the start of last year, the pool of young men available for the draft has been increased by raising the maximum age from 27 to 30. As well as call-up notices delivered by post, Russia's young men will be receiving notifications on the state services website Gosuslugi. In Moscow there were reports that call-ups had already been sent out on 1 April via the mos.ru city website. Increasing numbers of Russians are trying to avoid the army by taking on ""alternative civilian service"". But human rights lawyer Timofey Vaskin warned on independent Russian media that every new call-up since the start of the war had become a lottery: ""Authorities are coming up with new forms of refilling the army."" Quite apart from its twice-yearly draft, Russia has also called up large numbers of men as contract soldiers and recruited thousands of soldiers from North Korea. Moscow has had to respond to extensive losses in Ukraine, with more than 100,000 verified by the BBC and Mediazona as soldiers killed in Ukraine. The true number could be more than double. Putin has scaled up the size of the military three times since he ordered troops to capture Ukraine in February 2022. Russia's defence ministry linked the December 2023 increase in the size of the military to ""growing threats"" from both the war in Ukraine and the ""ongoing expansion of Nato"". Nato has expanded to include Finland and Sweden, as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Finland has Nato's longest border with Russia, at 1,343km (834 miles) and Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Tuesday that his country would join other states neighbouring Russia in pulling out of the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines. Poland and the Baltic states made similar decisions two weeks ago because of the military threat from Russia. Orpo said the decision to resume using anti-personnel mines was based on military advice, and that the people of Finland had nothing to worry about. The government in Helsinki also said defence spending would be increased to 3% of economic output (GDP), up from 2.4% last year. The FSB say they detained a ""Ukrainian special services agent"". Kyiv has not commented on the attack. Plymouth-based frigate HMS St Albans monitored the Admiral Golovoko as it entered the Channel. The US president's envoy meets Vladimir Putin in Moscow, while Ukraine calls for more pressure on Russia. As Russia and the US seek to repair ties, could they secure a peace deal acceptable to Ukraine, asks the BBC's Russia editor.

https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-launch-permanent-troop-deployment-lithuania-nato-eastern-flank-russia-ukraine/,"BERLIN — Germany officially launched its first permanent foreign troop deployment since World War II	 on Tuesday — a 5,000-strong armored brigade in Lithuania — as Berlin moves to bolster NATO’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine. According to the German military’s lobbying group, the newly created 45th Armored Brigade was formally activated during a ceremony outside Vilnius. A temporary headquarters was established, with the brigade's crest unveiled and the unit now officially under the command of Brigadier General Christoph Huber. “We have a clear mission: to ensure the protection, freedom and security of our Lithuanian allies on NATO’s eastern flank,” Huber told dpa, the German press agency. “In doing so, we also protect NATO territory — and Germany itself.” Berlin pledged the long-term deployment in 2023, breaking with decades of German defense policy that avoided permanent stationing of combat troops abroad. The unit is set to be fully operational by 2027 and will eventually be based in a new military complex in Rūdninkai, roughly 30 kilometers south of Vilnius. Until then, troops will operate out of temporary Lithuanian bases. The plan includes not just frontline forces but also support units — such as a medical center, signal company and command support teams — across multiple locations. Currently, 150 German troops are stationed in Lithuania. That number is expected to reach 500 by year’s end. For NATO, the deployment represents a critical part of the alliance’s shift to deterrence by forward defense. For Germany, it’s a major step in shedding its reputation as a reluctant military power. Lithuania, which borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave and Kremlin ally Belarus, sees the move as vital to its national security. The war in Ukraine has turned the Baltic region into a frontline zone — and Berlin’s presence into a symbol of NATO’s long-term commitment.",Germany launches permanent troop deployment on NATO’s eastern flank,Chris Lunday,POLITICO,2025-04-01T05:27:02,2025-04-01T05:27:25,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/eu-tariffs-trump-reciprocal-liberation-us-von-der-leyen-f840e2963db21508937e644e3cb6d974,"BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union official warned the U.S. on Tuesday that the world’s biggest trade bloc “holds a lot of cards” when it comes to dealing with the Trump administration’s new tariffs and has a good plan to retaliate if forced to. U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to roll out taxes on imports from other countries on Wednesday. He says they will free the U.S. from reliance on foreign goods. He’s vowed to impose “reciprocal” tariffs to match the duties that other countries charge on U.S. products, dubbing April 2 “Liberation Day.” “Europe has not started this confrontation. We do not necessarily want to retaliate, but if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told EU lawmakers. The commission, the EU’s executive branch, negotiates trade deals on behalf of the bloc’s 27 member countries and manages trade disputes on their behalf. “Europe holds a lot of cards, from trade to technology to the size of our market. But this strength is also built on our readiness to take firm counter measures if necessary. All instruments are on the table,” von der Leyen said, at a European Parliament session in Strasbourg, France. The commission already intends to impose duties on U.S. goods worth some $28 billion in mid-April in response to Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs. The EU duties will target steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and farm goods. A lot remains unknown about how Trump’s levies will actually be implemented, notably the “reciprocal” tariffs, and the EU wants to assess their impact before taking retaliatory action. “So many Europeans feel utterly disheartened by the announcement from the United States,” von der Leyen said. “This is the largest and most prosperous trade relationship worldwide. We would all be better off if we could find a constructive solution.”",Europe says that it holds a lot of trade cards on the eve of Trump's tariff 'Liberation Day',,AP News,2025-04-01T04:34:35,2025-04-01T05:42:34,gemini-2.0-flash

https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-power-facility-in-kherson-left-city-without-electricity-despite-ceasefire/,"Some 45,000 residents of Kherson were left without electricity after a morning Russian attack on one of the city's power facilities, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on April 1 during a joint press conference with his Lithuanian counterpart Kestusis Budrys. The attack happened after Russia andUkraineannounced apartial ceasefireon strikes against energy facilities following technical consultations with the U.S. in Riyadh the previous week. ""After Riyadh, one of the agreements with the U.S. was about not striking at energy infrastructure,"" Sybiha said at the press conference. ""At the same time, Russia continues to violate this agreement,"" the minister said, adding that Ukraine has also recorded attacks against energy facilities in the Kherson, Kharkiv, and Poltava oblasts since March 25. According to thelocal military administration, the Central and Korabelnyi districts of Kherson are without electricity. Electric transport is partially out of service due to the outages. Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has consistently used targeted missile and drone strikes to knock out Ukraine's power grid, while Kyiv has hit oil and gas facilities inside Russian territory with long-range drones. Ukraine and the U.S. previously agreed on a full30-day truceduring their talks in Jeddah on March 11. Russia had rejected this proposal unless it included conditions undermining Kyiv's ability to defend itself, such as a full halt on foreign military aid. Moscow has claimed that its side of the energy ceasefire has been in effect since March 18, when Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly declared ahalt on such attacksfollowing a call with U.S. President Donald Trump. In spite of this, Russian forces also reportedly attacked Kherson'senergy infrastructureon March 27, violating the terms of the U.S.-brokered limited ceasefire.","Russia again violates partial ceasefire by attacking Kherson energy facility, Kyiv says",Kateryna Hodunova,The Kyiv Independent,2025-04-01T06:28:38.000,2025-04-01T07:10:56.000,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-april-1-2025/,"The Times of Israel liveblogged Tuesday’s events as they unfolded. Two Iranian businessmen have been indicted for allegedly conspiring to procure US parts to build military attack drones, the Justice Department says. Hossein Akbari, 63, and Reza Amidi, 62, are charged with money laundering and providing material support to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which the United States designates as a foreign terrorist organization. According to court documents, Akbari is the chief executive of a company called Rah Roshd while Amidi is the commercial manager. The Justice Department says Akbari and Amidi, who previously worked at Qods Aviation Industries (QAI), an Iranian state-owned aerospace company, are both at large. “The defendants conspired to obtain US-origin parts needed to manufacture drones for military use in Iran and send those parts to Iran in violation of export control laws,” US Attorney John Durham says in a statement. “The IRGC and QAI have been core players in the Iranian military regime’s production of drones, which threaten the lives of civilians, US personnel and our country’s allies.” According to the Justice Department, Akbari and Amidi have evaded US sanctions since 2020 to procure US parts for use in Iranian-made drones, including the Mohajer-6. A Mohajer-6 drone used by the Russian military was shot down by the Ukrainian Air Force in September 2022 and found to have parts manufactured by several US-based companies, it says. Former hostage Eliya Cohen, who was snatched by Hamas terrorists from the Nova music festival and held captive for 505 days, tells Channel 12 that his captors drastically increased the amount of food he was given during his last weeks in captivity after the gaunt appearance of hostages released before him sparked international outrage. Cohen was held captive with Eli Sharabi and Or Levy, who were returned to Israel on February 8, dangerously emaciated. The three were also held together withAlon Ohel, who has yet to be released. He tells Channel 12 that for the majority of his time in captivity, he received very little food. “You can deal with being humiliated, you can deal with being cursed at, you can deal with your legs being in chains,” he says. “Hunger is a daily struggle because, beyond being hungry, you are also fighting for your life. Every night, you go to sleep thinking, ‘what am I going to do tomorrow to get that piece of pita bread?'' He says that most days, their captors would give each of the four men a piece of pita, and one or two spoonfuls of beans or peas, but on other days, “I would beg God for that to be the case. For it to be a dry pita with two spoons of beans.” He says sometimes the terrorists would bring them three pitas instead of four, and ordered the men to share, claiming they would give them another one later in the day. “You find yourself begging — and they enjoy it,” he says. “They know they are starving you.” Cohen says that occasionally, he and the other hostages would try and make a personal appeal for their captors to provide them with more food, and were successful. “I can’t describe that feeling when you suddenly manage to pull on his heartstrings and they quietly enter the room and bring you some pita, or chocolate bar or peanut butter bar,” he tells Channel 12. “It’s the best thing that has ever happened to you in your life at that moment, because you survived another day.” Although he had no access to the outside world for the duration of his captivity, Cohen says he realized that a ceasefire deal must have been signed when, in late January, his captors started appearing “very, very happy.” “Suddenly more food started coming in,” he says. “A month before we went home, a [Hamas] commander arrived. He saw us in terrible condition and ordered us to be unchained because essentially, ‘the fighting is over.''” He says that their terrorist captors started “stuffing us with a lot of food, in particular after Eli and Or were released. It made a stir.” Despite having been severely malnourished up until that point, Cohen says he didn’t struggle to adjust to the larger quantities of food. “You are so insecure from the lack of certainty of nutrition and food that you want to put anything in your mouth,” he says. The US State Department announces that President Donald Trump’s senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs Massad Boulos has also been appointed its senior adviser for Africa. As part of the new role, Boulos will travel later this week to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda to meet with government officials and business leaders in addition to “advancing efforts for durable peace in the eastern DRC and to promote US private sector investment in the region,” the State Department says. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will take off from Ben Gurion International Airport for Budapest on Wing of Zion at 11:15 p.m. Wednesday night. He is slated to meet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and TamÃ¡s Sulyok on Thursday. As he usually does, Netanyahu will remain abroad over Shabbat at taxpayer expense and will return to Israel on Sunday afternoon. Maj. Gen. (res.) Sami Turgeman, former head of the IDF’s Southern Command, is in the running to become the next Shin Bet chief, according to multiple Hebrew media reports. An official in the Prime Minister’s Office denies the reports, telling The Times of Israel that “Turgeman is not a candidate for the head of the Shin Bet.” Turgeman was in charge of the Southern Command during the 2014 Operation Protective Edge against Hamas in Gaza while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in office. Current IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir was Netanyahu’s military secretary at the time and replaced Turgeman in 2015. Turgeman is CEO of Noga, an independent company that manages Israel’s electric system. Last month, Zamir appointed Turgeman to head an external panel of former senior officers to evaluate the military’s probes into Hamas’s October 7, 2023, onslaught and oversee the implementation of the findings. Earlier today, Netanyahu announced thathe was backtrackingon his decision to appoint Vice Adm. (res.) Eli Sharvit as the next head of the Shin Bet following a whirlwind day of criticism of the nomination both in Israel and abroad. Netanyahu is looking to replace Ronen Bar, who was formally fired by the cabinet earlier this month but who remains in his post thanks to a temporary injunction imposed on his dismissal by the High Court of Justice, which is hearing petitions against the firing. Though the court froze Bar’s firing, it allowed Netanyahu to interview candidates to replace him. Accepting the US State Department’s 2025 International Woman of Courage Award, former Hamas hostage and sexual assault survivor Amit Soussana calls for global action to secure the immediate release of the remaining captives in Gaza. “It is an incredible honor to stand before you today, but it is also a deeply painful moment,” says Soussana, who is one of eight women from around the world presented with the award at a State Department ceremony in Washington, but the only one given a personal shout-out by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and the only one asked to give keynote remarks to those in attendance. Soussana is presented with the award by Rubio and First Lady Melania Trump. “While I am here, my friends remain in the darkness. Five hundred and forty-three long days and nights. They are still suffering, still waiting, still hoping. Their voices remain unheard. So I will speak for them. We cannot move forward until they are free,” Soussana says in her remarks. Soussana was taken captive during Hamas’s October 7 onslaught and released as part of the first hostage release and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in November 2023. Since her release, she has advocated around the world on behalf of those still held in Gaza and became the first former hostage to speak about the sexual violence she endured while in captivity. “In captivity, I had no control over my body, no control over my life. I resisted as best as I could, but it was not enough to stop what happened to me,” she says. “The darkness was suffocating. Yet even in the darkness, there was one thing they could not have taken from me, the strength my mother instilled in me. The belief that we must always stand for what is right, no matter the cost.” “I vowed that if I would survive, I would never be silent. I would speak — not just for myself, but for every woman who had been silenced,” Soussana says. “When I first told my story, I only wanted to raise awareness about the horrors of captivity and the terror of October 7, but my story became part of a much bigger conversation — one about sexual violence, about war and about the unimaginable strength of women in the face of brutality.” “In Israel, we’re about to celebrate Passover — the story of liberation, of breaking free from bondage. But this will be the second Passover that the hostages remain in captivity,” she laments. “I accept this award, not for myself, but in the name of all the brave women of Israel, the women who endure, who led, who refused to break. Women are stronger. We are the stronger gender, not because we do not feel pain, but because we rise from it, because we fight — not just for ourselves, but for those who cannot fight for themselves.” “This award comes at a critical moment. The hostages cannot wait. Every single day that passes is another day of unimaginable suffering. With every passing moment, their pain deepens, their hope fades and their chances of survival diminish,” she says. “I call on the world to act to bring them home now, not tomorrow, not next week. Now.” The DemocratsÂ	chair Yair Golan blasts the government for “unleashing violence in the West Bank,” after dozens of masked settlers descended on the Palestinian village of Duma earlier today and set fire to several homes. “The pogrom in Duma is not a glitch — it is the result of a deliberate policy,” Golan writes on X. “The government is empowering rioters and unleashing violence in the West Bank, creating a permanent security emergency in order to survive politically.” “The head of the government is a man who is being closed in on by a ring of investigations, a man who has lost his judgment and the public’s trust,” the left-wing politician fumes. “To stay in office, he is pushing for escalation in Judea and Samaria (the Biblical name for the West Bank) — even at the price of the lives of soldiers and civilians.” Israel “must not abandon security to a dangerous government that is fueled by fear,” Golan adds. “Israel needs leadership that understands security, in order to rehabilitate, and bring back security and hope.” US President Donald Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to London says he will ask Britain to reverse a partial suspension of arms exports to Israel, a decision taken over rights concerns. Warren Stephens, an Arkansas-based investment banker and political donor to Trump named for the coveted diplomatic posting, says he is “a little perplexed” by the decision of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. “What I’ve read about that, with the UK halting some of their shipments to Israel, is certainly concerning,” Stephens says at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “I would do my part to encourage them to reinstate those permits and to try to get them, you know, what they need to continue the fight,” he says. His comments come in response to a question from Republican Senator Rick Scott, who said Starmer’s Labour Party “treats Israel as a problem and not a solution” and called on Stephens to “try to educate” Britain on Israel. Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, announced in September that Britain would suspend 30 out of 350 arms export licenses to Israel out of fear the weapons could be used in breach of humanitarian law amid the war in Gaza, sparked by the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led invasion and massacre in southern Israel. Starmer said at the time that the UK still supported “Israel’s right to self-defense” but was “committed to the international rule of law.” The defense attorney for Jonatan Urich — one of the central suspects in the so-called Qatargate scandal — claims during a hearing in the Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court that police investigators attempted to blackmail his client into testifying as a state witness, Hebrew news outlets report. Urich was detained for questioning by police yesterday alongside his colleague Eli Feldstein, a former spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, regarding the pair’s alleged illicit ties to Qatar. The two were brought before the court earlier today as police requested to extend their detention by nine days. Judges granted an extension lasting only until Thursday. According to Urich’s attorney, Amit Hadad, who also represents Netanyahu, the suspect was threatened by police investigators during questioning yesterday. They supposedly pressured Urich into testifying against other suspects in the case, telling him to “think long and hard if he wants to see his baby” that night. Hadad continues, claiming that investigators told Urich: “You know how to deduce one thing from another,” in effect telling him to become a state witness. The investigator in the courtroom denies the accusations and says that “not a word was uttered about [Urich] being a state witness.” She further claims that it was Urich himself who brought up seeing his child that night, rather than police interrogators. Urich and Feldstein are suspected of having been paid to spread pro-Qatar messaging to reporters in order to boost the Gulf state’s image as a mediator in indirect hostage talks between Israel and Hamas, all while in the employ of Netanyahu. A senior police official in the Lahav 433 serious crimes unit told the Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court that the police are concerned over the possibility of obstruction of justice in the Qatargate investigation due to the fact that attorney Amit Hadad, who is representing Jonatan Urich, one of the central suspects in the scandal, is also Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s lawyer. Netanyahu gave testimony as a person with knowledge of the affair on Monday, although it has yet to be decided if he will be questioned by the police under caution, as a suspect. “There is a problem here in that attorney Amit Hadad represents the prime minister, and is also the attorney of one of the suspects here,” says Superintendent Gili Rachlin. “Attorney Hadad was with the prime minister yesterday after we finished the questioning. He knows what he [Netanyahu] said in his testimony. What he was asked. There is, therefore, a significant concern for obstruction of justice,” he continues. Rachlin made his comments following demands by Hadad for the investigators to demonstrate why they were investigating Urich on suspicion of bribery, among other alleged violations of the law. A more junior investigator had been reticent to divulge such evidence in court because Hadad represents both men. Hadad vehemently objected to Rachlin’s concerns and threatened to file a complaint against him, asserting that the claims were baseless. After a group of some 50 Israeli settlers entered the Palestinian West Bank village of Duma earlier this evening, setting fire to property and attacking residents, the military says troops and police officers worked to disperse a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians. In a statement, the IDF says it received reports that dozens of Israelis entered Duma and set fire to property. “Afterward, a violent confrontation developed between Israeli civilians and Palestinians in the area, and additional report was received regarding several Palestinians who were injured in the incident,” the IDF says. It says troops and police officers reached the scene and worked to “disperse the violent confrontation.” “The IDF condemns incidents of this type and will continue to act with determination to maintain security and order in the region,” the military adds. There are no reports of arrests in the incident. Five suspects were briefly caught by police, but defense sources say they managed to escape. #Ø¹Ø§Ø¬Ù	| Ù	Ø³ØªÙ	Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø¶Ø±Ù	Ù	Ù	Ù	 Ø§Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø§Ø± Ù	Ù	Ø¨Ù	Ù	Ù	Øª Ø§Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø§Ø·Ù	Ù	Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø¨Ø¨Ù	Ø¯Ø© Ø¯Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø§ Ø¬Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø¨ Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø¨Ù	In his testimony to police investigators probing the Qatargate case yesterday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he did not know of any connection between his advisers and either Qatar or any representatives of Qatar, Channel 12 reports. Rishon LeZion Magistrate’s Court Judge Menahem Mizrahi, when lifting a gag order on the case earlier today andsumming up key allegations, saidÂ	both Feldstein and Urich allegedly had such connections. The prime minister is not a suspect in the case, and was not questioned under caution. In a video statement after giving his testimony yesterday, Netanyahu said investigators had no actual evidence against Urich and Feldstein, and claimed they were being “held hostage” in a political witch hunt. The Israel Farmers’ Federation lambasts the Finance Ministry’s decision to immediately scrap remaining tariffs on US goods, mainly in agriculture, against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s plans to slap trade partners with tit for tat duties. Amit Yifrach, who chairs the federation and serves as Secretary General of the Moshav Movement, and Uri Dorman, the federation’s secretary general, say in a joint statement, “This is a step that will bring disaster to local agriculture.” They say that “particularly today, after October 7 [2023],” when Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israel, “we must internalize the importance of agriculture to the last furrow and strengthen the farmers who live near the [Gaza] border.” They add, “There is no doubt that trade relations with the US are important and appropriate, but we must ensure that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater, harming food security and national security.” After US President Donald Trump said yesterday â	March 31 â	that he plans to visit Saudi Arabia and other Mideastern countries “next month,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarifies that he was referring to the month of May. “The president will be heading to Saudi Arabia in May. As for specific dates and details, we will be reading those out to you as soon as we possibly can,” Leavitt says during a press briefing. Asked whether ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza will be a prerequisite for his trip, Leavitt says the US continues to work for a ceasefire in Ukraine. She doesn’t say the same thing about Gaza, instead stressing that the US backs Israel. Members of the Abu Samra clan in the Gaza city of Deir al-Balah have executed an individual who they say is a Hamas operative responsible for the deadly shooting of one of their relatives earlier today. The Hamas operative allegedly shot Abdulrahman Sha’aban Abu Samra while he was waiting in line for flour in Deir al-Balah. ð	: Ø§Ù	ØªØ	Ø¸ Ø¹Ù	Ø§ ØªÙ	Ù	 Ø§Ù	Ù…Ù	Ø³Ø§Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø¨Ù	 Ø§Ø¹Ø¯|Ù	Ø« Ø§Ù	Ø§Ù	Ù	 Ù	Ø¨Ù	Ø´Ø§Øª Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯ Ø§Ù	Ø±Ø	Ù	 Ø´Ø¹Ø¨Ø§Ù	 Ø£Ø¨Ù	 Ø³Ù	Ø±Ø© ",April 1: Former IDF Southern Command chief Sami Turgeman said to be in running to lead Shin Bet,ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-04-01T00:58:41,2025-04-01T23:27:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.dw.com/en/top-advisers-to-netanyahu-arrested-in-corruption-case/a-72100829,"Israeli police on Monday said they had arrested two of the closest aides to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Jonatan Urich and Eli Feldstein, on suspicion of illicit ties to the Qatari government. The arrests on Monday mark a development in what local media has dubbed as Qatargate — an investigation probing potential foreign influence, national security breaches and political misconduct. Shortly after the arrests, Netanyahu himself was summoned by police to his office in Jerusalem. He had left his ongoing corruption trial in Tel Aviv earlier in the day to comply with the summons issued by Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, according to Israeli media. Netanyahu is not listed as a suspect in the case. He was questioned as someone with knowledge of the affair, local media reported. The arrests were carried out by Lahav 433, Israel's elite anti-corruption and serious crimes unit, in coordination with domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet. The investigation is operating under a court-imposed gag order until April 10. Allegations at heart of Qatargate case The case centers on allegations that Feldstein, Netanyahu's former spokesperson, worked for an international firm contracted by Qatar while simultaneously employed at the Prime Minister's Office. According to investigators, Feldstein allegedly promoted pro-Qatar narratives to Israeli media while receiving payments from the Gulf state. Feldstein has previously faced charges for leaking classified documents related to hostage negotiations with Hamas. The current investigation expands on those charges, potentially implicating others within Netanyahu's inner circle in a broader scheme involving foreign interference and misuse of government resources. The charges under review reportedly include bribery, breach of trust, money laundering, contact with a foreign agent and national security violations. Israel: Netanyahu calls his corruption trial a 'witch hunt' Netanyahu's Likud party condemns investigation Netanyahu's ruling Likud party has responded with fierce condemnation, calling the arrests politically motivated and part of an orchestrated effort to unseat the prime minister. A statement released by the party on Monday accused the Attorney General's Office and Shin Bet of ""conducting fabricated investigations'' and attempting to ""carry out a coup d'etat through arrest warrants.'' ""This is not an investigation. This is not law enforcement,'' the statement read. ""This is an assassination attempt on democracy.'' Aside from the Qatargate probe, Netanyahu remains on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in unrelated corruption cases The party claimed the arrests were intended to block Netanyahu's efforts to dismiss Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Attorney General Baharav-Miara, both of whom are reportedly under government scrutiny. The Supreme Court has temporarily frozen Bar's removal and will hear the case on April 8. But the opposition has pushed back against Likud's narrative. Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, criticized the ruling bloc's failure to directly deny financial ties between Netanyahu's aides and Qatar. ""The sentence that does not appear in the Likud statement and that should be noted: ‘No one from Benjamin Netanyahu's office received money from Qatar,''' Lapid said in a parliamentary session. Meanwhile, Netanyahu's legal troubles continue on multiple fronts. Aside from the Qatargate probe, he remains on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in unrelated corruption cases. Israelis fear for democracy just as much as for the hostages Why Qatar? Although Israel and Qatar lack formal diplomatic ties, Doha has played a key mediating role in indirect negotiations with Hamas during the ongoing war in Gaza. The Gulf nation's alleged financial links to Netanyahu's aides — particularly during sensitive hostage talks— have raised concerns about national security and foreign influence. Legal experts suggest that if funds from Qatar were indeed funneled to Israeli officials during active negotiations, it could constitute a serious breach of national security laws.

https://apnews.com/article/russia-taliban-afghanistan-terrorism-ban-62230db41231d5607eda9128f1122c69,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s Supreme Court on Monday said it received a petition from the prosecutor general’s office to lift a ban on Afghanistan’s Taliban, who were outlawed two decades ago as a terrorist group. The court said in a statement it would hold a hearing on the petition, submitted by Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov, on April 17. Russia last year adopted a law stipulating that the official terrorist designation of an organization could be suspended by a court. The Taliban were put on Russia’s list of terrorist organizations in 2003. Any contact with such groups is punishable under Russian law. At the same time, Taliban delegations have attended various forums hosted by Moscow. Russian officials have shrugged off questions about the seeming contradiction by emphasizing the need to engage the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan, which the group rules. The former Soviet Union fought a 10-year war in Afghanistan that ended with Moscow withdrawing its troops in 1989. Since then, Moscow has made a diplomatic comeback as a power broker, hosting talks on Afghanistan involving senior representatives of the Taliban and neighboring nations. There is a deepening divide in the international community on how to deal with the Taliban, who have been in power for three years and face no real opposition. Afghanistan’s rulers have pursued bilateral ties with major regional powers. In recent years, the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have removed the Taliban from their lists of terror groups. There are U.N. sanctions on the Taliban.",Russian authorities move to lift the terrorist designation for the Taliban,,AP News,2025-03-31T10:45:54,2025-03-31T12:31:42,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.europeafrica.army.mil/ArticleViewPressRelease/Article/4139490/press-release-three-us-soldiers-found-deceased-after-m88a2-hercules-recovered/,"WIESBADEN, Germany  — Three U.S. Army Soldiers assigned to 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division
c were found deceased in Lithuania today, March 31. The Soldiers, whose identities are being withheld pending notification of next of kin, went missing in the early morning hours of March 25 in their M88A2 Hercules armored recovery vehicle while conducting a mission to repair and tow an immobilized tactical vehicle. Search and recovery operations continue for the remaining fourth Soldier.
U.S. Army units supported by Lithuanian Armed Forces and law enforcement conducted a search in the area and found the Soldiers’ vehicle submerged in a body of water in the early hours of March 26.
The M88A2 was removed from the peat bog early Monday morning, March 31, after a six-day-long effort that required tremendous resources from Lithuania, our steadfast Ally, and hundreds of service members from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, Lithuanian Armed Forces and the Polish Armed Forces—along with other elements from the Lithuanian government and civilian agencies—to solve the engineering challenge of recovering the 63-ton-vehicle from an area surrounded by unstable ground conditions.
“The Soldiers we have lost in this tragedy were not just Soldiers - they were a part of our family. Our hearts are heavy with a sorrow that echoes across the whole Marne Division, both forward and at home,” said Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie, 3rd Inf. Div. commanding general. “We stand in grief with the families and loved ones of these extraordinary ‘Dogface Soldiers’ during this unimaginable time. But the search isn’t finished until everyone is home. Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.”
Lithuanian armed forces provided military helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, unmanned aerial systems, and search and rescue personnel immediately to join the effort, and over the sequence of days brought in excavators, sluice and slurry pumps, other heavy construction equipment, technical experts, and several hundred tons of gravel and earth to enable the recovery.
“Today is a very sad and tragic day. The loss of these Soldiers weighs heavy on me, the hearts of all Task Force Iron service members, and the 3rd Infantry Division. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of these brave Soldiers,” said Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor, commander of Task Force Iron and the 1st Armored Division. “I'd like to personally commend the heroic efforts of the search parties, and especially our Lithuanian allies who were instrumental in the recovery efforts. Their courage and commitment to this operation will always be remembered and demonstrates the strong relationship between our countries. However, search and recovery efforts are not complete - they will continue until we bring all of our Soldiers home.”
U.S. Navy divers assigned to Commander, Task Force 68 assisted the recovery team with finding and accessing two hoist points Sunday evening. They maneuvered through thick layers of mud, clay, and sediment with zero visibility to reach the vehicle and hook steel cables that were attached to two M88A2 Hercules. Partway through the extraction the M88A2s began to lose traction, so several dozers were attached to provide additional grip. It took approximately two hours of winching to remove the M88A2 from the bog.
The dive team has since transitioned to gridding out the area to enable a systematic search and the team is using a ground penetrating radar provided by Lithuanian experts to assist in the ongoing recovery operations. U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania Kara C. McDonald joined U.S. Army Europe and Africa Commander Gen. Christopher Donahue to observe ongoing recovery efforts today near Pabradė.
The Soldiers were deployed to Lithuania in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve, and were permanently stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia.
""The Raider family is heartbroken over the tragic loss of our Soldiers. We are ensuring we provide the needed support to their families and our Soldiers as we go through this grieving process. We are an incredibly tight-knit family, and their absence is keenly felt, and we will hold them close in our memories. I want to extend my personal thanks to everyone who assisted in the search and recovery efforts,” said Col. James Armstrong, 1st Armored Brigade Commander. “The Raider Brigade is incredibly appreciative of all the support we received from our Lithuanian and Polish Allies, and our brothers and sisters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who contributed to helping us recover our Soldiers. We will never forget the dedication, commitment and teamwork that enabled us to recover our Soldiers and provide closure for their families. We are truly stronger together.""
In addition to the support provided at the site, the Archbishop Metropolitan of Vilnius, Gintaras Grušas, led a mass at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Stanislaus and St. Ladislaus of Vilnius, March 30, to pray for the four Soldiers, their families, and those conducting recovery operations. The service was attended by American and German soldiers deployed to Lithuania, Lithuanian soldiers, senior Lithuanian and American officials, and U.S. and NATO military leaders. Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Minister Dovilė Šakalienė, Lithuanian Armed Forces Commander General Raimundas Vaikšnoras, and Ambassador McDonald also attended.
Commander, U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, also attended the service in the Lithuanian capital and later visited the recovery site. “Our sense of partnership drives us forward, and you take care of our Soldiers as if they were your own,” Cavoli told reporters before the mass. NATO also sent assets to assist with recovery efforts.
The U.S. Army and Lithuanian authorities are investigating the cause of the accident. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available.

https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2025/03/31/iran-summons-swiss-envoy-issues-warning-over-trump-s-threats,"Iran’s foreign ministry summoned the Swiss chargé d’affaires in Tehran on Monday over threats made by US President Donald Trump, warning of a decisive response to any hostile action. Switzerland has represented US diplomatic interests in Iran since the two countries severed ties following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. According to the official IRNA news agency, the Swiss envoy was summoned in protest of “continued acts of aggression by [Israel]” and “threats made by the US president.” For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app. The Iranian foreign ministry warned against any hostile actions and reaffirmed Tehran’s “determination to respond swiftly and decisively to any threat,” the agency said. Trump said in a Saturday interview that “there will be bombing” if Iran doesn’t agree to a nuclear deal. “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” he said, according to NBC News, which said he also threatened to punish Iran with what he called “secondary tariffs.” Speaking on Monday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned of a forceful retaliation if the US or its allies bomb the Islamic Republic. “They threaten to do mischief,” Khamenei said of Trump’s latest threat, during a speech on Eid al-Fitr, the holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. “If it is carried out, they will definitely receive a strong counterattack.” On March 7, Trump said he had sent a letter to Khamenei, calling for new nuclear talks and warning of possible military action if Iran refuses. The letter was delivered to Tehran on March 12 by UAE presidential advisor Anwar Gargash. Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters in Iran, has dismissed Trump’s outreach, accusing him of trying to mislead global public opinion by portraying the US as open to talks and Iran as the obstacle. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Thursday that Tehran’s response to Trump’s letter was sent via Oman, which has in the past served as a go-between in the absence of formal US-Iran diplomatic ties. While Iran has ruled out direct talks as long as Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy remains in place, it has signaled openness to indirect negotiations. President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Sunday that Khamenei had permitted indirect talks. The “maximum pressure” policy, reinstated by Trump on his return to the White House in January, saw him reimpose sweeping sanctions on Iran during his first term after abandoning the 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The JCPOA had offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program. Western countries, including the US, have long accused Iran of seeking nuclear weapons – an allegation Tehran denies.

https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-ukraine-war-trump-europe-dcec45198b64234f3a71c8ce805c0065,"BEIJING (AP) — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi traveled to Moscow on Monday for talks with his counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, as Russia and Ukraine discuss U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the 3-year-old war. Wang is scheduled to meet with Lavrov on Tuesday, days after Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after Trump spoke with the two countries’ leaders. It remains to be seen when such a truce might take effect, how long it might last and what targets would be off-limits. Trump lashed out at both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday, expressing frustration with the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. Although Trump insisted to reporters that “we’re making a lot of progress,” he acknowledged that “there’s tremendous hatred” between the two men. He said he was “angry, pissed off” that Putin questioned Zelenskyy’s credibility. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun, in comments consistent with China’s position, emphasized Beijing’s assertions of neutrality in the Ukraine conflict. “We always believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only viable way out of the crisis. China’s cooperation with Russia does not target a third party and should not be affected by any third party,” Guo told reporters at a daily briefing. China did not mention Ukraine in its announcement of Wang’s trip, saying only that the two countries “continue to deepen back-to-back strategic coordination and expand practical cooperation across various fields,” as well as “upholding the basic norms governing international relations.” “The Chinese side is ready to take this visit as an opportunity to work with the Russian side ... on international and regional issues of common concern,” a Foreign Ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying. China has provided strong diplomatic support for Russia in the more than three years since it launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbor, along with an economic lifeline through the trade in energy and consumer goods. However, it has not knowingly provided Russia with weapons or military expertise and has put forward a vague peace plan that was swiftly dismissed by most observers. Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed his unwavering support for Russia’s war in Ukraine during a meeting with a top Russian security official in Pyongyang on Friday. That came after South Korean intelligence assessment in late February that North Korea had likely sent additional troops to Russia after its forces suffered heavy casualties fighting Ukrainian forces.",Chinese official visits Moscow as Russia and Ukraine discuss Trump's proposal to end war,,AP News,2025-03-31T09:04:34,2025-03-31T05:57:28,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-848221,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu officially rescinded the appointment of former naval chief V.-Adm. (ret.) Eli Sharvit to head the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency), his office announced on Tuesday. The prime minister thanked Sharvit for his willingness to take on the role, but informed him that after further consideration he intended to explore other options. Sharvit said, ""I was asked by the Prime Minister to take on the role of head of the Shin Bet and to continue serving the State of Israel at this difficult time - and so I did. This is out of full confidence in the ability of the Shin Bet to meet the complex challenges that have arisen in these days, and a humble belief in my abilities to lead it to this end."" Netanyahu had previously stunned the country twice on Monday, first rolling Sharvit as the new head of the Shin Bet, only to have anonymous aides of his suggest later in the day that the pick might be withdrawn. At press time, it was still not clear whether Netanyahu would stick with Sharvit as his new candidate to run the agency or whether he would opt for another name. Due to a petition to the High Court of Justice, any new appointment will not go into effect before April 8 in any case, and may be further delayed. In initial reactions from Shin Bet sources to The Jerusalem Post, Sharvit was so unknown that most of them had little to say, despite a clear sense of shock that Netanyahu had not only refrained from appointing a deputy Shin Bet chief to the role (which has been customary in recent decades), but that he had taken someone outside of the agency and even outside of IDF ground forces. All hints from Netanyahu spokespeople until Monday had been that the four final candidates for the role were: recent deputy Shin Bet chief ""M"", an earlier deputy Shin Bet chief Yair ""Rolly"" Sagi, former Shin Bet high command official Shalom Ben Hanan, and former Mossad high command official who had also served extensively in the Shin Bet Eyal Tzir Cohen. It was known that Netanyahu was interviewing other candidates, but none of them had been taken seriously by the media and no one had named Sharvit. Netanyahu's choice of Sharvit seemed to be a sign not only that he does not trust the current Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, who the government is trying to fire, but that he also does not trust the top tiers of the agency, and seeks to bring in an outsider disrupter to wrestle greater control over it. However, there is nothing in Sharvit's public record to indicate that he would be an ideological disrupter who would disrespect top Shin Bet officials, other than that he is not close to them since the navy and the agency have little to do with one another. Sharvit served 36 years in the Israeli Navy, including as chief of staff from 2014-2016 and commander from 2016 until 2021. As commander, Sharvit led the development of maritime defense capabilities for Israelâs economic waters and directed complex operational campaigns against Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, the PMO said early Monday. ""The Prime Minister is convinced that Maj. Gen. Sharvit is the right person to lead the Shin Bet forward and uphold the organizationâs proud legacy,"" the PMO added early Monday. However, by Monday afternoon, many Likud and coalition officials, some anonymously and some publicly, were attacking Sharvit. Some attacks related to his participation in protests against the judicial overhaul, while others related to some public criticism he had made of the Trump administration. By later in the afternoon, leading Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham was publicly calling for Netanyahu to drop Sharvit. At the same time, there were some parties on the Left who said that even if he was technically qualified, there was a cloud of suspicion over the fact that he was accepting the role at a time when Netanyahu's firing of Bar was seen as highly controversial. Some legal officials even implied that Netanyahu was using Sharvit to soften potential High Court resistance to firing Bar. It was not clear whether Netanyahu would go back to the original shortlist of four candidates, or opt for some other darkhorse and unknown candidate. The firing of Bar has sparked mass protests across the country, with many considering the move a direct threat to democracy. Netanyahu and Bar have been in a public war of words for the last six weeks since Barâs Shin Bet opened a probe into top aides of the prime minister regarding the scandal known as Qatargate. Qatargate refers to allegations that top Netanyahu aides were paid funds by Qatar in a way that could have impacted their handling of national security matters, including the hostage negotiations with Qatar and Hamas. Netanyahu has also sought to shift blame from himself for failure to stop the October 7 disaster on the Shin Bet and the IDF, seeking Halevi and then Bar's resignations, in order to highlight that blame. High Court Justice Gila Kanfi-Steinitz wrote last week that she âdid not see the needâ to expand a temporary injunction freezing the firing of current head Bar such that it included a prohibition to interview new candidates. This effectively rejected the position of Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara, according to which the prime minister could not take any action that could affect Barâs status, including interviews of new candidates. This means that Netanyahu can name a new agency chief, but that the new candidate cannot take office before the April 8 High Court hearing. The High Court may allow the new candidate to take office, may block his appointment due to Qatargate, or may seek a compromise allowing Bar to conclude theQatargateprobe, while allowing the new candidate to move into office as quickly as possible.",Netanyahu rescinds appointment of new Shin Bet chief																																																																						 after																																																																						 one																																																																						 day,"YONAH JEREMY BOB, MATHILDA HELLER",The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-31T03:04:33,2025-04-01T13:01,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkxm1rg6k1o,"The Red Cross movement has expressed outrage that eight Palestinian medics were killed along with six Civil Defence first responders and a UN staff member by Israeli forces in southern Gaza. Five ambulances, a fire truck and a UN vehicle were struck ""one by one"" in the al-Hashashin area on 23 March, according to a UN official. The 15 bodies were recovered from a ""mass grave"" on Sunday, he said. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said a ninth medic was missing and accused Israel of targeting staff. Israel's military said troops fired on vehicles ""advancing suspiciously"" without headlights or emergency signals. It said a Hamas operative and ""eight other terrorists"" were among those killed. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said in a statement on Sunday that the eight bodies of PRCS medics were retrieved ""after seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen"". The organisation identified those killed as ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan. It added that ambulance officer Assad al-Nassasra was ""still missing"". ""I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians,"" IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said. ""They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. ""Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected."" The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a separate statement that it was ""appalled"" that the medics were killed while carrying out their work. The head of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Gaza, Jonathan Whittall, said in a post on X on Sunday that its staff had supported the PRCS and Civil Defence in recovering the 15 bodies of the PRCS medics, Civil Defence first responders and UN staff member from ""a mass grave... that was marked with the emergency light from one of their crushed ambulances"". In a video that was posted online on Monday, Mr Whittall said: ""Seven days ago, Civil Defence and PRCS ambulances arrived at the scene. One by one they were hit, they were struck. Their bodies were gathered and buried in this mass grave. We're digging them out with uniforms, with their gloves on. They were here to save lives. Instead, they ended up in a mass grave."" ""Their vehicles... are crushed and dumped, covered in sand next to us. It's an absolute horror what has happened here. This should never happen. Healthcare workers should never be a target."" The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said the UN staff member was one of its employees and that the burial of the bodies in ""shallow graves"" was ""a profound violation of human dignity"". The PRCS said it was devastated by the ""massacre of our team"". ""[Israel's] targeting of Red Crescent medics, despite the protected status of their mission and the Red Crescent emblem can only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law,"" a statement added. At the funeral for the medics on Monday, the father of Ashraf Abu Labda told the BBC: ""They [Israeli troops] targeted the first vehicle, then the second and then the third. They killed them in cold blood."" ""We've been trying to look for them for eight days. They refused all co-ordination with Red Crescent, OCHA, or the UN. No-one can hold them accountable. Only God,"" Nasser Abu Labda said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that during an operation in southern Gaza on 23 March ""several vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights, or emergency signals, their movement was not co-ordinated in advance. Thus, IDF troops opened fire at the suspected vehicles.""

https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-republican-headquarters-fire-investigation-8b97dd1b9441d38690d3980ae576d337,"ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) — Federal authorities are investigating a fire early Sunday that damaged the entryway to the headquarters of the Republican Party of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Agents working with local authorities recovered unspecified “incendiary materials” at the scene, said Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokesperson Cody Monday. He declined to say what the materials were or to share further details. The fire follows numerous acts of vandalism in recent weeks directed against Tesla, the electric-car company whose owner, Elon Musk, has led Republican President Donald Trump’s effort to slash the federal workforce. Several of those cases involved Molotov cocktails that were used to start fires at dealerships. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has called it a “wave of domestic terrorism.” Attacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk’s electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. Firefighters responded to the fire just before 6 a.m. and brought it under control within about five minutes, according to Lt. Jason Fejer with Albuquerque Fire Rescue. The building was unoccupied and no one was injured. But the blaze badly burned the entrance and caused extensive smoke damage throughout the office, where three people work full time, according to Fejer and Republican party representatives. A photo provided by GOP representatives showed the charred entrance of the building with wood and pieces of burned insulation scattered on the ground. A broken and burned door was set to one side. The GOP office’s security system detected the fire, said New Mexico Republican Party Chair Amy Barela. She credited firefighters with quickly extinguishing the flames and preventing the fire from spreading. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller called arson a cowardly act. “Politically motivated crimes of any kind are unacceptable, and I am grateful to our fire department for their swift response,” the mayor, a Democrat, said in a statement Sunday afternoon. “This incident is being investigated at the federal level, and I urge anyone with information to report it immediately.” Barela said GOP representatives also found spray paint on the side of the building about 50 feet (15 meters) from the entrance, saying “ICE=KKK.” Monday, the ATF spokesperson, declined to comment on the graffiti. Agents from the FBI also were on the scene investigating, according to Fejer. FBI representatives could not be reached immediately for comment.",Authorities investigate damaging fire at New Mexico's GOP headquarters,,AP News,2025-03-30T16:25:58,2025-03-30T19:46:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-848194,"With hostage talks at an inflection point, the Israel-Hamas War appears to have gone on cruise control, starting on Thursday of last week and lasting through Sunday. There have been continued aerial attacks and limited new ground incursions, but no serious broadening of the invasion has been recorded. Given that there has been little new in the Gaza invasion in the last four to five days, the government appears to have held up a yellow light on the progress of the invasion to allow time for reaching a new hostage deal with Hamas. This has occurred before the IDF dives deeper into other portions of Gaza, forcing most of the population to evacuate to the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone on the Mediterranean coast. The last time the IDF said it killed dozens of Hamas terrorists was Thursday of last week. On both Friday and Sunday, the IDF sent out zero updates on the fighting in Gaza. On Saturday, there was one minor update about an incursion into a less important area of Rafah as well as an update on a series of airstrikes. The last major ground move was on March 26, when the IDF ordered a broad evacuation of Palestinians from northern Gaza, including portions of Zeitoun, Rimal, Tel al-Hawa, and two other areas. Adding these evacuations to earlier ones from Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanun, and Jabalya, most of the northern Gaza areas that are important to Hamas beside the downtown part of Gaza City itself, Shejaia, and Shati, had been evacuated by then. As such, those new ground maneuvers on March 26 were significant. Also, on March 26, the IDF attacked those areas of Gaza that had been responsible for an unidentified impact near Zimrat, a border community by Gaza. Hamas’s rocket fire on March 26 was not successful in terms of killing anyone, but one of the two rockets fired did get through, and the Gazan terrorist groups continue to show the capability to fire two to three rockets at a time.Likewise, on Saturday, the IDF struck areas of Khan Yunis from which mortars had been fired on nearby IDF forces. In the broader view, the most destructive part of renewed hostilities by far was March 18 itself when the air force struck around 80 significant targets, including many top Hamas political officials, in under 10 minutes. What followed was a few days of steady escalation and invasion into different sectors of the Gaza Strip. This seemed to culminate on March 26 and could have broadened further to Gaza City, new parts of Khan Yunis, and new parts of central Gaza, but instead, so far, this has plateaued. Already last week, a forum of high-ranking reservists called on IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir to broaden the invasion and put maximal pressure on Hamas, just as advocates for the remaining hostages pressured the government to cut a new deal with the Gazan terrorist group and halt the latest hostilities. Israel renewed hostilities after a 42-day ceasefire, followed by a nearly three-week deadlock between the sides on the next steps of the ceasefire.","Gaza war in cruise control as Israel, Hamas await hostage deal breakthrough",Yonah Jeremy Bob,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-30T17:43:00,2025-03-30T18:22:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-says-cabinet-voted-to-step-up-military-pressure-on-hamas-in-gaza/,"ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 572 Lazar Berman is The Times of Israel's diplomatic reporter Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said ministers voted overnight to increase military pressure on Hamas, asserting that the methods were â	€œworkingâ	€	 to bring about a deal to free hostages held in the Gaza Strip. â	€œIt works because it acts simultaneously,â	€	 he said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. â	€œOn the one hand, it crushes Hamasâ	€	™s military and governmental capabilities, and on the other hand, it creates the conditions for the release of our hostages.â	€	 The security cabinet last night voted to increase pressure on Hamas, the premier said. The vote was held as massive nationwide protests continued against his governmentâ	€	™s policies on the return of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Elaborating on what he said were three Hamas â	€œfalse claimsâ	€	 about Israelâ	€	™s negotiating posture, Netanyahu said, first, that in contrast to Hamas assertions, Israel is continuing to negotiate, but that it this being done â	€œunder fire,â	€	 which he claimed makes it more effective. â	€œWe see that there are suddenly cracks,â	€	 he said, though Hamas has yet to agree to Israelâ	€	™s demands for a new, extended ceasefire. Media reports on Saturday said Hamas had agreed to an Egyptian proposal to release five living hostages in exchange for a 50-day ceasefire in Gaza. According to multiple media reports, this does not meet the demands of Israel, which is insisting on the return of 10 or 11 living hostages to resume the truce, based on a previous proposal by US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. Israel on Saturday confirmed it had received the proposal from mediating countries and sent a counterproposal â	€œin full coordination with the US.â	€	 Israel is also willing to talk about â	€œthe final stageâ	€	 of a hostage release-ceasefire deal with Hamas, Netanyahu insisted, countering what he called the second Hamas lie about the negotiations. The prime minister had previously refused to enter talks on the second phase of a ceasefire deal reached in January, which would involve discussing the end to the war. Instead, he pushed for an extension of the first phase of the deal. Hamas refused, and Israel renewed intensive military operations throughout Gaza on March 18. â	€œWe are ready,â	€	 Netanyahu said Sunday. â	€œHamas will lay down its weapons. Its leaders will be allowed to leave [Gaza]. We will take care of general security in the Gaza Strip, and enable the implementation of the Trump plan, the voluntary immigration plan.â	€	 â	€œThatâ	€	™s the plan. Weâ	€	™re not hiding it,â	€	 he went on. Israel â	€œis ready to discuss it at any time,â	€	 he said, referring to the US presidentâ	€	™s contentious plan, which triggered global outrage after Trump suggested the US â	€œtake overâ	€	 Gaza and turn it into the â	€œRiviera of the Middle East,â	€	 while forcing its Palestinian inhabitants to relocate to Egypt, Jordan or other countries. The third Hamas lie, according to Netanyahu, was that he doesnâ	€	™t care about the hostages: â	€œThis is what Hamas puts in its propaganda films in order to create division within us,â	€	 he argued. He said that Israel is â	€œcommitted to bringing back the hostages,â	€	 and claimed that the combination of military and diplomatic pressure is the only thing that has worked, and â	€œnot all the empty claims and slogans that I hear in the [TV] studios from the experts.â	€	 The renewal of military operations in Gaza has sparked fears among hostage families that their loved onesâ	€	™ lives will be in increased danger, as some captives were killed in captivity by strikes, or by their captors when troops appeared to be approaching their location. Addressing stepped-up attacks in Lebanon, Netanyahu said that Israel â	€œrespectsâ	€	 Lebanon and its armed forces, â	€œtherefore, we demand from them things that you demand from someone you respect.â	€	 â	€œLebanon is responsible for what comes out of its territory, and it must ensure thatâ	€¦ no attacks against Israel come out of its territory,â	€	 Netanyahu said, apparently referring to recent rocket fire over the past week. He also thanked the US for carrying out strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, calling it â	€œa big change.â	€	 The US on March 15 launched a new campaign of airstrikes against the rebel group after it threatened to resume attacks on â	€œany Israeli vesselâ	€	 in nearby maritime routes as a response to Israel stifling the flow of aid into Gaza. Though former US president Joe Biden also carried out strikes against the Houthis during his term, the campaign was more limited and targeted mostly at launch sites. Under Trump, American fighter jets and drones began bombing high-ranking Houthi personnel and denser city neighborhoods. â	€œWe always value alliances,â	€	 Netanyahu said. â	€œWe have an alliance with the greatest power in the world, and it stands behind us there and in other arenas without reservation, and with the full appreciation of the citizens and the government of Israel.â	€	 Supporting The Times of Israel isnâ	€	™t a transaction for an online service, like subscribing to Netflix.

https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-hungary-icc-arrest-warrant/,"The Israeli prime minister is the target of an arrest warrant charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Hungary on April 2 despite an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), his office reportedly said Sunday. He is expected to meet with his Hungarian counterpart, Viktor Orbán, as well as other high-level Hungarian officials before going back to Israel on April 6. Netanyahu is targeted by an ICC arrest warrant charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. According to Le Monde, Hungary considers it doesn’t have to abide by ICC decisions. The war in Gaza was triggered by the attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when the militant group killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251. Since then, the Israeli offensive has killed more than 50,000 people in Gaza and displaced more than 90 percent of the area’s population. On March 18, a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended when the Israeli armed forces resumed airstrikes and land incursions. The three mediators — Egypt, Qatar and the United States — are working to secure another deal as well as the freeing of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. On Saturday, Hamas said it had accepted a new ceasefire plan proposed by the mediators. Israel, however, has made a counter-proposal.

""We don't avoid talks,"" Pezeshkian said in televised remarks during a cabinet meeting. ""Itâ	ms the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far. They must prove that they can build trust.â	"" Pezeshkian was speaking in response to a letter sent by US President Donald Trump to Tehranon 12 March, the exact contents of which were not revealed. Iran's reply, which was delivered to the US through the sultanate of Oman, did however leave the door open for potential indirect negotiations with Washington. The White House did not offer an immediate response to the Iranian president's remarks, but in an interview with NBC that aired on the same day but was recorded just prior to Tehran's comments, Trump said ""If they donâ	 make a deal, there will be bombing and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.""

One prominent example, they said, can be found in Russia’s auto imports from China. These had surged over the past year – as Chinese manufacturers sought a market for their products out of the reach of Western tariffs and trade restrictions – but signs of weakness began to appear in October following Moscow’s increases to vehicle import taxes and recycling fees, as well as the devaluation of the rouble. This trend continued in the first two months of 2025. Chinese customs figures showed that the trade value of passenger cars sent to Russia dropped 48.8 per cent to US$749.9 million year on year, and that of truck shipments plunged 87 per cent to US$40.8 million. Analysts said US President Trump's involvement in negotiating a ceasefire with Ukraine could steer the previously rock-solid relationship between Beijing and the Kremlin in a new direction. “I think the phase of rapid and active growth in trade turnover between China and Russia will indeed be frozen for a while,” said Aleksei Chigadaev, a former visiting lecturer with the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.",Car trouble: is a drop in China-Russia auto shipments a bad omen for trade?,Kandy Wong,South China Morning Post,2025-03-30T04:00:11,2025-03-30T06:14:11,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-848114,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuand Hungarian Prime MinisterViktor Orbán “share a true friendship,” according to Zoltán Kovács, a senior adviser to Orbán and secretary of state for public diplomacy and relations. “There is a strong bond between the two men, and I believe it was long overdue for Mr. Netanyahu to visit Hungary and discuss these important issues,” he toldThe Jerusalem Postin an interview on Wednesday ahead of Netanyahu’s visit to Hungary. This will be Netanyahu’s first visit to Europe since theInternational Criminal Courtissued an arrest warrant for him and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, charging them with war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the Israel-Hamas War. Netanyahu would not be arrested upon arrival, because Hungary will not cooperate with the court on this matter, Kovács said. “The decision itself is outrageous,” he said, adding that it effectively denies Israel’s right to self-defense. “International organizations have been hijacked by the liberal world order, andthe ICCis being used as a political weapon – a witch hunt.” Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Orbán has occasionally taken positions that differ from the European Union’s stance on the war. US President Donald Trump has been working to broker a deal between Russia and Ukraine, and Hungary fully supports his initiative, Kovács said. “We believe that calling for peace and an immediate cessation of hostilities is in Ukraine’s best interest,” he told the Post. “We have been advocating for this approach for nearly three years, right from the very first moment.” In response to criticism that Hungary’s position would compromise Ukraine’s security and allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to benefit from the war, Kovács said: “Hungary is a supporter of Ukraine. Let’s not forget that the largest humanitarian-aid effort Hungary has contributed over the past years has been directed toward Ukraine.” Calling for peace is the “real form of friendship,” because pushing Europe into further wars and sacrificing generations of Ukrainians for a conflict that should never have started was irresponsible behavior, he said. “Pushing integration into areas where it is impossible, certainly by force, will not helpEuropeanintegration,” he added. Even before the Ukraine war, Hungary had tensions with the EU, Kovács said. One of the main points of contention between Hungary and the EU has been the issue of accepting migrants from Syria due to the civil war in the last decade, he said, adding that while the EU opposed Hungary’s decision not to allow migration, many are adopting a similar stance today. “Hungary has advocated for a common-sense, well-established policy on illegal migration: that it should be stopped because it’s dangerous,” Kovács said. “Illegal migration brings in a different culture and mindset, which is causing problems on the streets of Western European cities, and only the blind could fail to see that.”","Netanyahu to travel to Hungary this week, meet with Viktor Orban",AMICHAI STEIN,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-30T07:32:56,2025-04-02T18:29:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250330000900320?section=national/diplomacy,"SEOUL, March 30 (Yonhap) -- The top trade officials of South Korea, China and Japan on Sunday discussed bolstering trade cooperation among the three countries in their first trilateral ministerial meeting in six years. The 13th Trilateral Economic and Trade Ministers' Meeting among the Republic of Korea, Japan and the People's Republic of China took place in Seoul, involving South Korean Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto. It marked the first time since December 2019 that the industry ministers of the three nations held a trilateral meeting, as well as the first such meeting taking place in Seoul in 10 years. The 2019 meeting was held in Beijing. Sunday's meeting was a follow-up to the summit of the three countries' leaders held in Seoul last year. ""Amid the rapidly changing global economic and trade environment, the meeting of the three countries' trade ministers for the first time in six years carries significant resonance not only for the three nations but also for the international community,"" Ahn said in his opening remarks. He called for efforts to create a ""stable"" environment for global trade by restoring the role of the World Trade Organization. Ahn also urged the three countries to join hands to respond to current issues in the global trade market, such as the rise of new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), digital transformation of economies and supply chain cooperation on critical minerals.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) In Sunday's meeting, the three ministers agreed to cooperate for the proposed trilateral free trade agreement and advance the regional comprehensive economic partnership (RCEP) amid the expansion of trade protectionism in the global market, according to Seoul's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. RCEP is one of the world's biggest free trade agreements, which South Korea, China and Japan have signed. The 15 member nations of RCEP account for around 30 percent of the global gross domestic product, population and trade volume. Ahn, Wentao and Muto also agreed to boost cooperation on creating a ""predictable"" business environment in the region, and exchanged opinions on measures to stabilize supply chains and export control issues, according to the ministry. The ministry said the three countries also discussed bolstering cooperation for the successful hosting of the Osaka Expo, set to kick off next month in Japan, and the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit to be held in South Korea's southeastern city of Gyeongju in November and in China next year. On the sidelines of the three-way meeting, Ahn was also scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Muto later in the day, following his one-on-one meeting with Wentao on Saturday. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)","Trade chiefs of S.

https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-a3f305c689ebaa46698b5958b09f1b9b,"CAIRO (AP) — The Hamas militant group said Saturday it has accepted a new Gaza ceasefire proposal from mediators Egypt and Qatar, but Israel said it has made a counter-proposal in “full coordination” with the third mediator, the United States. Egypt early in the week made a proposal to get the troubled ceasefire back on track, following Israel’s surprise resumption of fighting. It was not immediately clear whether the proposal changed before Khalil al-Hayyah, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, announced it had been accepted. Early in the week, an Egyptian official described the proposal to The Associated Press, saying Hamas would release five living hostages, including an American-Israeli, from Gaza in return for Israel allowing aid into the territory and a weekslong pause in fighting. Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the closed-door talks. On Saturday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave no details about Israel’s counter-proposal, which it said was offered after Netanyahu held consultations on Friday. Israel a week and a half ago ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people. The White House blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting. Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel also wants Hamas to give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile. On Saturday, Israel widened its ground operations in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Frustrated by the threat to remaining hostages in Gaza, families and others rallied again Saturday evening to call for a deal that would bring everyone home. “The price of your war is the life of the hostages!” some protesters chanted in Tel Aviv. Minor scuffles broke out with police. “War will not bring our hostages home, it will kill them,” Naama Weinberg, cousin of deceased hostage Itay Svirsky, told a weekly gathering of families in Tel Aviv. The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 50,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. Israel’s bombardment and ground operations have caused vast destruction and at their height displaced some 90% of Gaza’s population of over 2 million people. Early this month, Israel again cut off all supplies to Gaza to pressure Hamas to accept new terms to the ceasefire that started in mid-January. Israel had balked at entering negotiations over the truce’s second phase, which were meant to begin in early February. Under the agreement, phase two was meant to bring the release of the remaining 24 living hostages, an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at ",Hamas says it accepts a new Gaza ceasefire proposal but Israel makes a counter-offer,"SAMY MAGDY, JULIA FRANKEL",AP News,2025-03-29T21:00:55,2025-03-29T17:00:55,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/thailand-myanmar-earthquake-latest-rescue-4069e6865c131848968a118644350284,"BANGKOK (AP) — The death toll from Myanmar’s powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake keeps climbing amid rescue efforts. The military government said Saturday that 1,644 people have been killed, with thousands of others injured and dozens missing. Myanmar’s main resistance movement, meanwhile, announced a partial ceasefire to facilitate relief efforts. The earthquake struck midday Friday, followed by several aftershocks, including one that measured 6.4. In Thailand, the quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, leaving 10 people dead. Several countries, including Malaysia, Russia and China have dispatched rescue and relief teams. Here is the latest: Myanmar’s shadow National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military, has announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts. An announcement said that its armed wing, the People’s Defense Force, will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas. It said it would “collaborate with the U.N. and nongovernmental organizations to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,” in the areas it controls. An initial situation report on earthquake relief efforts issued by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that it’s mobilizing with other groups, and $5 million has been allocated from a Central Emergency Response Fund for “life-saving assistance.” “Supply infrastructure and communication towers were severely impacted, electricity and water services were disrupted, including in Yangon Region,” it noted. “Landline, mobile and internet networks remain unstable.” The immediate planned measures include a convoy of 17 cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies from China that is expected to arrive on Sunday, it said. It noted the severe damage or destruction of many health facilities, and warned that a “severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers.” Myanmar’s ruling military said on state television that the confirmed death toll from the 7.7 magnitude earthquake increased to 1,644. The new total is a sharp rise compared to the 1,002 total announced just hours earlier. The number of injured increased to 3,408, while the missing figure rose to 139 from Friday’s quake. Russia has sent a medical team to Myanmar to care for earthquake victims, a Health Ministry official said. According to Alexey Kuznetsov, the medics include specialists in infectious diseases, resuscitation and traumatology. Separately, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said that two planes carrying Russian rescue workers have landed in Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon. Earlier, the ministry reported that a mission, including search and rescue teams, canine units, anaesthesiologists and psychologists, was on its way to the disaster-stricken country. The ministry said that its rescue teams are equipped with “endoscopes and acoustic devices for searching for people in rubble up to 4.5 meters (nearly 15 feet) deep, as well as ground-penetrating radars and thermal imagers.” Hong Kong sent a group of 51 search-and-rescue personnel to help with earthquake relief efforts in Myanmar. The group includes firefighters and ambulance personnel as well as two search-and-rescue dogs, among others. The group brings along nine tons (18,000 pounds) of equipment including life detectors and masonry cutting machines, as well as an automatic satellite tracking antenna system that provides network connection, according to a statement on the Hong Kong government’s website. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show the earthquake toppled the air traffic control tower at Naypyitaw International Airport. The photos taken Saturday show the tower toppled over as if sheered from its base. Debris lay scattered from the top of the tower, which controlled all air traffic in the capital of Myanmar. It wasn’t immediately clear if there had been any injuries in the collapse, though the tower would have had staff inside of it at the time of the earthquake Friday. It likely also stopped air traffic into the international airport, given all electronics and radar would have been routed into the tower for controllers. Flights carrying rescue teams from China have landed at the airport in Yangon instead of going directly to the airports in the major stricken cities of Mandalay and Naypyitaw. A spokesperson for the China International Development Cooperation Agency said that Beijing will provide Myanmar with 100 million yuan ($13.8 million) in emergency humanitarian aid for earthquake relief efforts. An additional rescue team of 82 people left Bejing, hours after a different team of emergency responders from the Chinese province of Yunnan, bordering Myanmar, arrived in the earthquake-stricken country. Additionally, 16 members of the Chinese civil relief squad Blue Sky Rescue Team in the city of Ruili, Yunnan, departed to Muse City in northern Myanmar to help with relief efforts, according to state broadcaster CGTN. Chinese authorities also sent a first batch of 80 tents and 290 blankets. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping extended condolences to Myanmar’s leader Min Aung Hlaing. The earthquake was felt in parts of China’s Yunnan province, though casualties were limited. Two people in Ruili suffered minor injuries and 847 homes were damaged, according to authorities. Some high-rise buildings and older houses in urban areas were also partially damaged, but power and water supplies and transportation and communications lines have been restored. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters says that his government will support relief efforts “via the International Red Cross Movement.” “Our thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones, and to everyone else affected,” Peters posted on X. South Korea will send the aid through international organizations to support recovery efforts following the recent earthquake. The Foreign Ministry stated on Saturday that Seoul will closely monitor the situation and consider additional support if needed.",The Latest: Countries sending humanitarian aid after Myanmar earthquake,,AP News,2025-03-29T05:44:25,2025-03-29T14:22:53,gemini-2.0-flash

Qassem says Hezbollah is committed to the November 27 ceasefire agreement ending over a year of fighting with Israel and claims that the terror group has no armed fighters south of the Litani River in Lebanon despite Israel maintaining a presence in Lebanon with five strategic posts along the border. The IDF has struck dozens of Hezbollah fighters operating in southern Lebanon since the ceasefire, accusing the terror group of violating the deal. Qassem adds that Hezbollah will not accept normalization between Israel and Lebanon, which he says is a desire of Jerusalem. He also says that if Israel does not commit to the ceasefire, Hezbollah will have no choice but to return to “other options.” In the past week, there were two incidents in which rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory amid the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza. On Friday, the IDF attacked Beirut for the first time since the ceasefire on the northern front took effect. Hezbollah denied any connection to the two incidents.

The main protest by the coalition of protest groups will begin at 6:30 p.m. at Tel Aviv’s Habima Square. At the conclusion of the demonstration, protesters will march to Begin Street to join the group of hostage families who rally there. Separately, the rally at Hostages Square will be addressed by freed hostage Iair Horn, whose brother Eitan Horn is still held in Gaza; 				Eli Shtivi, the father of Idan Shtivi; Bar Godard, the daughter of Manny Godard; Einav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker; Major General (Ret.) Yom-Tov Samia; and actor Michael Rapaport. Rallies calling for the return of the hostages will also take place throughout the country, including in Jerusalem, Carmei Gat and at the Sha’ar HaNegev Junction. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum says in a statement that relatives of those held in Gaza are “urging all Israelis, from every background and political viewpoint” to attend the protests. The protests will be held against the backdrop of the government’s passage of key judicial overhaul legislation and an ongoing impasse in the hostage negotiations amid the resumption of fighting in Gaza, as well as the firing of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and the advancement of the dismissal of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. A poll aired yesterday by Channel 12 showed 69 percent of Israelis support ending the war in exchange for a deal that releases all remaining hostages in Gaza, compared to 21% who oppose such an agreement. Even among coalition voters, a majority (54%) back such a move compared to 32% who oppose it.","Tens of thousands expected to rally Saturday night against judicial overhaul, in favor of hostage deal",ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-03-29T08:20:55,2025-03-29T08:20:55,gemini-2.0-flash

Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Wentao, held a bilateral meeting in Seoul ahead of the trilateral meeting of industry ministers of South Korea, China and Japan, scheduled for the following day, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. The previous meeting of the two countries' industry ministers was held in San Francisco in November 2023. In the latest meeting, the two sides agreed to continue bilateral cooperation in trade under the multilateral trading systems of the World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) amid heightened global tensions sparked by major economies' protectionist policies, according to the ministry. Ahn and Wentao also discussed expanding cooperation in supply chains of critical minerals, which are essential for advanced industries, such as battery and semiconductor. The two sides also agreed to cooperate for the successful hosting of the upcoming APEC summit to be held in South Korea this year and in China next year, the ministry said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgdgxql6vpo,"Four people have been killed and another 21 injured in a mass Russian drone attack on the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, the area's regional head has said. Serhiy Lysak said a restaurant complex and several residential buildings were ablaze after the attack late on Friday. He added that ""the enemy sent more than 20 drones"" to the city, and that ""most of them were shot down"". Images and videos later emerged showing firefighters tackling large fires that had engulfed the buildings that were struck, and smashed glass and other debris scattered on the city streets. Overnight, air sirens were heard sounding in several other Ukrainian regions, including the capital, Kyiv. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the military administration in Zelensky's home city Kryvyi Rih, also confirmed on Telegram that there was a ballistic missile attack on the central city on Saturday morning, and that so far five people had been wounded. High-rise buildings and private houses, a school, a car wash were damaged in the strike, he said. Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said three Ukrainian drones were either intercepted or shot down over the western Belgorod region. In his video address late on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky again accused Russia of targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure - in violation of a temporary moratorium agreed earlier this month in talks involving the US. Moscow has also repeatedly blamed Ukraine for attacking Russia's energy sector. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested earlier this week that Ukraine should temporarily be placed under UN control to elect what he called a more ""competent"" government. It was seen as the latest attempt by the Kremlin to challenge the legitimacy of the Kyiv government - a move widely condemned by Ukraine's allies. Ukraine accused Putin of proposing ""crazy"" ideas to delay further movement towards a ceasefire deal being championed by US President Donald Trump. Washington said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a limited truce in the Black Sea. But Russia then put forward a list of conditions, including the lifting of some Western sanctions, prompting concerns that Moscow was trying to derail any moves towards a ceasefire. In a separate development, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that France and the UK were moving forward with plans for a ""reassurance force"" in Ukraine. The proposal was discussed at a summit of the ""coalition of the willing"" - Ukraine's allies from more than 30 countries - in Paris. Russia has repeatedly warned that the deployment of any European troops in Ukraine would be unacceptable, and such forces would be seen by the Kremlin as a legitimate target. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.","Four killed in mass Russian drone attack on Dnipro, Ukraine says",Jaroslav Lukiv,BBC News,2025-03-29T00:02:47,2025-03-29T07:13:48,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/un-south-sudan-guterres-war-kiir-machar-c308bca7e16a34c11be2bc75c2f910ea,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations chief urged regional and international leaders Friday to prevent South Sudan from falling “over the abyss” into another civil war and speak with one voice to support a return to peace. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world’s newest and one of its poorest countries is facing “a security emergency” with intensifying clashes and a “political upheaval” culminating with this week’s arrest by the government of First Vice President Riek Machar. “Meanwhile, ethnic and political targeting by security forces — coupled with the spread of misinformation on social media — is lighting the fuse for even worse,” he warned. “Let’s not mince words: What we are seeing is darkly reminiscent of the 2013 and 2016 civil wars, which killed 400,000 people.” The civil wars ended in a 2018 peace agreement that brought President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and Machar, an ethnic Nuer, together in a unity government, which is supposed to be heading toward delayed national elections in December 2026. But tensions have been increasing between Kiir’s and Machar’s parties, and they escalated in March when the White Army, an armed group loyal to Machar, overran an army base in Upper Nile state and attacked a U.N. helicopter. The government responded with deadly airstrikes. Guterres urged South Sudan’s leaders to “end the politics of confrontation,” restore the national unity government, and release detained military and civilian officials now. “I also urge the regional and international community, as guarantors of the (2018) peace agreement, to speak with one voice in support of the peace process and against any attempts to undermine it,” he said. Guterres said he spoke to the chair of the African Union Commission on Friday morning and announced the U.N.’s support for the deployment of the AU’s five-member Panel of the Wise and the special envoy of Kenya’s President William Ruto to South Sudan’s capital, Juba, to pursue a diplomatic solution. The U.N. chief said the Panel of the Wise and Kenyan envoy Raila Odinga will visit both Kiir and Machar. Odinga, a former prime minister of Kenya, was in Juba on Friday. But it was not immediately clear if he was able to meet with Machar. South Sudan’s Information Minister Michael Makuei said in a statement Friday that Machar was under house arrest pending an investigation into subversive activities. Machar was arrested to maintain stability and prevent the country from sliding back into conflict, he said, adding that the 2018 peace agreement with Machar remains in place. “The agreement has not collapsed,” Makuei said. But Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, deputy chairperson of the country’s main opposition party led by Machar, said Thursday the 2018 agreement “has been abrogated.” He said Machar’s arrest shows a lack of political goodwill to achieve peace and stability. Guterres stressed that the United Nations wants to see the visits by Odinga and the AU’s Panel of the Wise produce “the effect we want.” “And the effect we want is the re-establishment of the peace agreement and the creation of conditions for peace in South Sudan,” he said. ___ Associated Press reporter Deng Machol in Juba, South Sudan, contributed to this report.",UN chief says world leaders must speak with one voice to prevent a new civil war in South Sudan,Edith M.

Lula pitches Embraer jets to Vietnam Airlines, targeting a deal for ten E190 planes worth millions. Vietnam’s booming aviation market drives demand, and Brazil seeks a slice of this growth. Meanwhile, Lula nudges Vietnam to import Brazilian beef, promising jobs and a processing hub via JBS’s potential $50 million plant. Trade figures tell a bigger story: Brazil-Vietnam commerce hit $5 billion in 2023, fueled by soybeans and electronics. Vietnam, facing U.S. pressure over its trade surplus, diversifies imports, balancing relations with Brazil’s agricultural might. Lula also invites Vietnam to the BRICS summit Brazil hosts in July 2025, eyeing broader influence. Brazil and Vietnam Forge Strategic Trade Ties Amid Global Shifts The leaders sign a five-year plan covering defense, energy, and coffee—two nations leading global supply. Climate change threatens their crops, so they swap farming know-how. Lula pushes a Mercosur-Vietnam trade deal, leveraging Brazil’s bloc presidency later this year for mutual wins. Vietnam weighs its options as a manufacturing star, dubbed a “Tiger Cub” since opening up in 1989. Brazil, a beef and plane powerhouse, exports $8 billion in meat yearly and sees Vietnam as an Asian gateway. Both navigate global shifts, from Trump’s trade demands to net-zero goals by 2050. Challenges linger: Vietnam’s rules slow beef entry, and Embraer faces Boeing’s shadow. Yet, success could reshape trade flows, with Vietnam as Brazil’s launchpad into Asia. The story behind the numbers reveals two emerging players aligning for practical, not flashy, gains in a tense world. Copyright © 2025 The Rio Times All Right Reserved Forgot your password?

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-top-prosecutor-suspends-bulgarian-prosecutor-colleague-amid-probe/,"The European Public Prosecutor’s Officehas temporarily suspended its Bulgarian prosecutor Teodora Georgieva, who is the subject of an investigation into potential misconduct. Announced on Thursday, it’s the first suspension and internal investigation into allegations of misconduct by a prosecutor in EPPO’s four years of existence. Tasked with investigating serious fraud in the European Union, the office’s independence is essential to its function and reputation. The move comes amid broader concerns about attemptsby Bulgarian officials to impede EPPO’s high-profile investigations. “As the strongest measure available against any risk or perception of compromised integrity of investigations, the supervising Bulgarian European Prosecutor has been temporarily suspended,” an EPPO statement read. European Chief Prosecutor Laura Kövesi
said her officelaunchedan administrative inquiry into potential misconduct by Georgieva days after Bulgarian media reported on apparent links between the magistrate and an alleged criminal. Asked to comment on the matter, EPPO declined. Georgievaclaimsshe was pressured in a campaign related to a high-profile investigation into the Bulgarian state-owned gas storage expansion facility, Chiren. SheaccusedDelyan Peevski, a member of Bulgarian parliament, of threatening to stop her from indicting a former energy minister involved in the Chiren project. “They are threatening me, and successfully. I feel threatened by Peevski. First there was the fire in the family house, in which my mother died,” Georgieva told Bulgarian television channel bTV. After her motherdiedin the fire, which is being investigated as a potential arson, EPPO in recent weeks provided Georgieva with additional protection. Reacting to the bTV statements, PeevskiallegedGeorgieva was lying and called on EPPO to respond. The United Statesandthe United Kingdomhave sanctioned Peevski for “perpetuating corruption in Bulgaria.” The Sofia city prosecutor’s office in 2023initiatedan anti-corruption check on Georgieva that, according to local mediaCapital, did not turn up evidence of a crime.

https://apnews.com/article/xi-business-economy-foreign-investment-4c65118536089f361f1ecd060e0dca96,"BEIJING (AP) — In an address to major global business leaders, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged foreign investors to have faith in China’s business prospects, the latest move to revive the world’s second-largest economy that has been dragged down by a property bust and a loss of momentum. “China has always been and will certainly be an ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors,” Xi told executives, including Akio Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, Lee Jae-yong, chairman of Samsung Electronics and Stephen Allen Schwarzman, CEO of investment firm Blackstone. China remains a major exporter of products to countries around the world and boasts a domestic market of 1.4 billion people. However, massive overbuilding in the property sector has tied up trillions of dollars in capital, sapping business and consumer confidence and depriving the economy of its past vitality, while a tariff war unleashed by the U.S. is compounding those problems. Private businesses, which provide a large share of growth and jobs in the country’s state-dominated economy, have borne much of the burden after years of regulatory crackdowns have shaken the confidence of entrepreneurs and other investors. China’s unprecedentedly tough response to the COVID-19 outbreak also shut down business for much of three years and some sectors of the economy have yet to recover, particularly where global supply chains are involved. Yet, Xi, considered something a sceptic when it comes to inviting in overseas businesses, said foreign investors could have confidence that “the door of opening up will only open wider and wider. The policy of utilizing foreign investment has not changed and will not change,” he said. “China contains huge investment and consumption potential,” he added. China has set an economic growth target of about 5% for this year, the same as last year and a level that analysts said would be difficult to achieve. The government has said it would attempt to stimulate the roughly $20 trillion economy by borrowing more money for a slew of initiatives, such as giving 300 billion yuan ($41.3 billion) in rebates to consumers who trade in old cars and appliances for new ones. But much of the borrowing will go to supporting the housing market and local governments weighed down by debt. What is clear is that a trade war with the United States has left the outlook for the coming months uncertain. Trump has raised tariffs on imports from China twice since taking office in January, leaving them at 20% across-the-board. China has shown no sign of backing down, retaliating with tariffs on U.S. goods. Xi did not mention the tariffs directly, but appeared to be referring to the importance of stable trade terms by saying: “Blowing out other people’s lights will not make your own lights brighter. Blocking other people’s paths will eventually block your own paths.” For now, however, China is seeking to portray itself as “an ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors,” he said. “Going with China is going with opportunities. Believing in China is believing in tomorrow. Investing in China is investing in the future,” the president, who has made himself leader for life and also heads the ruling Communist Party, said. Others in attendance Friday included Amin H. Nasser, president of Saudi Aramco; Sherard Louis Cowper-Coles, the chair of China-Britain Business Council; Oliver Zipse, BMW CEO and Ray Dalio, chief investment officer of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.",China's Xi makes strong push for greater foreign investment as economy continues to lag,,AP News,2025-03-28T07:51:04,2025-03-28T03:51:04,gemini-2.0-flash

“Half of the world is dreaming about our ‘dictatorship,’ the dictatorship of real business and interests of our people,” Lukashenko, 70, said in his inauguration speech at the Independence Palace in the capital of Minsk.

Hundreds of opposition supporters living abroad held anti-Lukashenko rallies Tuesday to mark the anniversary of Belarus’ short-lived independence in 1918 following the collapse of the Russian Empire.

Lukashenko marked three decades in power last year, and his political opponents have denounced the tightly orchestrated Jan. 26 election as a farce. The Belarus Central Election Commission declared he won with nearly 87% of the vote after a campaign in which four token challengers on the ballot all praised his rule.

Opposition members have been imprisoned or exiled abroad by Lukashenko’s unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech.

Months of massive protests that were unprecedented in the history of the country of 9 million people followed the 2020 election and brought on the harsh crackdown. Over 65,000 people were arrested, thousands were beaten by police and independent media outlets and nongovernmental organizations were closed and outlawed, bringing condemnation and sanctions from the West.



Thousands of Lukashenko supporters attended Tuesday’s inauguration ceremony, where he denounced his critics as foreign stooges who were at odds with the people.

“You don’t and won’t have public support, you have no future,” he declared. “We have more democracy than those who cast themselves as its models.”

Belarusian activists say it holds more than 1,200 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Center.

“The election was held amid a deep human rights crisis, in the atmosphere of total fear caused by repressions against civil society, independent media, opposition and dissent,” according to a statement released Tuesday by Viasna and 10 other Belarusian human rights groups. They said Lukashenko’s hold on power is illegitimate.

Lukashenko has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, relying on subsidies and political support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself in office for a quarter-century, an alliance that helped the Belarusian leader survive the 2020 protests.

Lukashenko allowed Moscow to use the country’s territory to invade Ukraine in February 2022 and later hosted some of Russia’s tactical nuclear weapons.

Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus under government pressure after running against Lukashenko in 2020, vowed to keep fighting for the country’s freedom.

“Our goal is to break away from the Russian occupation and Lukashenko’s tyranny, and to return Belarus into the European family of nations,” Tsikhanouskaya said in a speech at the Lithuanian parliament,

Some observers say Lukashenko could now try to mend ties with the West.

Lukashenko already has been sending signals to the West about his readiness to start a dialogue and his desire to normalize ties in order to ease the total dependence on the Kremlin and soften Western sanctions during his seventh term,” said Valery Karbalevich, an independent political analyst.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78e2x7lz25o,"Western sanctions on Russia need to be increased, not weakened, in order to bring it to the negotiating table, Sir Keir Starmer has said. The prime minister accused Vladimir Putin of ""playing games and playing for time"" after the Russian president demanded sanctions were lifted before a US-brokered maritime ceasefire is enacted. ""Now is not the time for pulling back or weakening sanctions - now is the time to increase sanctions to get them to the table,"" Starmer said in Paris, where he is meeting European leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron, co-hosting Thursday's so-called ""coalition of the willing"" summit, has suggested a European reassurance force could ""respond"" if attacked by Moscow. Starmer said on Thursday a ""framework and a deadline"" was needed for Ukraine peace talks. He said he had agreed with partners at the summit, which hosted representatives from 30 nations as well as the European Union and Nato, that ""we must go further now to support the peace process, support Ukraine and increase the pressure on Russia to get serious"". ""It means increasing the economic pressure on Russia, accelerating new tougher sanctions, bearing down on Russia's energy revenues, and working together to make this pressure count,"" he said. Starmer said that the political mood to find a just and lasting peace in Ukraine was ""stronger and broader"" than it had ever been, adding that ""Europe as a whole has not been this strong and united in a long time"". The UK will chair the next meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact group, comprised of dozens of countries, to deliver further military aid and ""keep Ukraine in the fight"", Starmer said. The prime minister said defence chiefs from the UK, France and Germany would also be meeting in Ukraine, but did not specify a date. Speaking with Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier, Starmer accused Russia of ""continuing to inflict devastating attacks on the Ukrainian people"" and said Putin's promises were ""hollow"". Zelensky said that everybody at the meeting understood ""that Russia doesn't want any kind of peace"" and was ""dragging out the war, adding that they would discuss security guarantees in the coming weeks and days. In a post on X, the Ukrainian leader thanked the UK and France for their support and shared a picture of himself and Starmer holding talks, describing the plans as a ""coalition of strength for the sake of peace"". ""Our unity and joint work in Europe, with the United States, and other partners, can force Russia into peace,"" Zelensky added. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking the terms of a separate, tentative deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure. Washington announced the Black Sea deal had been agreed on Tuesday, after holding separate talks with delegations from Ukraine and Russia in Saudi Arabia. But just hours later, the Kremlin said it would not take effect until sanctions were lifted on Russian banks, producers and exporters involved in the international food and fertiliser trades. Moscow's demands include reconnecting Russian banks involved in the agrifood trade to the Swift payment system, lifting restrictions on servicing ships under the Russian flag involved in the food trade, and revoking sanctions on the supply of agricultural machinery and other goods involved in food production. US President Donald Trump said the US government was ""looking at"" Moscow's request - but the EU said it would not consider removing sanctions before the ""unconditional"" withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's internationally-recognised territory. Zelensky said on Wednesday he hoped the US - which is not a part of the coalition of the willing - would ""stand strong""in the face of Russian demands. Macron confirmed that European countries had ""unanimously agreed"" that sanctions against Moscow should not be lifted. ""The time is not ripe to lift sanctions... We need to keep economic pressure up,"" he said. The French president said that if a European force protecting a ceasefire in Ukraine came under attack, it would ""respond to it"". ""If there was again a generalised aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would be under attack, and then it's our usual framework of engagement,"" he said. ""Our soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it."" The UK and France are leading efforts to send a force to Ukraine to deter any future Russian aggression in the event of a ceasefire. Starmer reiterated on Thursday that Parliament should have a say on deploying troops. European leaders put on a show of unity in Paris. In reality many have already ruled out sending troops to Ukraine. Countries including Finland and Poland feel under direct threat from Russia and feel their troops need to protect their own borders. Others fear deploying soldiers would be a deeply unpopular decision at home. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – who has repeatedly expressed her scepticism at the Franco-British plan – has been working to put forward an ""alternative"" option which would see soldiers serve in Ukraine exclusively as part of a United Nations military contingent. European officials say that under any peace settlement, Ukraine's first line of defence against any future Russian attack would be its own army. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said a European force in Ukraine would risk a ""direct clash between Russia and Nato"", state-owned news agency Tass reports. ""London and Paris continue to nurture the idea of a military intervention into Ukraine. All of that is being cloaked under [the guise of] a certain peacekeeping mission,"" Zakharova said.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/thousands-rally-in-tel-aviv-for-hostages-and-against-the-oct-7-government/,"Thousands of Israelis protested for the release of the hostages and against the government earlier tonight at Tel Aviv’s Habima Square. Hundreds of participants then joined hostage Matan Zangauker’s mother, Einav, in marching to the nearby Begin Gate. Police officers — some on horseback — sought to prevent demonstrators from blocking the road, leading to a clash that saw several protesters thrown to the ground. Seven protesters were arrested, according to Hebrew media reports. Addressing the earlier Habimah protest, former IDF general Noam Tibon asserted that the IDF’s renewed military operations are endangering the hostages. “But the October 7 government doesn’t care about this. They are busy toasting the passage of their budget,” Tibon said. Former police chief Roni Alsheich told the crowd that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting against the national interest and called on fellow members of the national religious camp to speak out against the premier and his government. The protest was held against the backdrop of the government’s passage of key judicial overhaul legislation and an ongoing impasse in the hostage negotiations.

https://buenosairesherald.com/economics/caputo-confirms-us20-billion-deal-between-argentina-and-imf,"Economy Minister Luis Caputo has confirmed that the Argentine government has reached an agreement with the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a US$20 billion loan. The agreement must now be approved by the Fund’s board of directors. IMF spokeswoman Julie Kozack did not give a figure during a Thursday press conference but described the deal as “sizable.”  “What I can say now is that discussions on a new Fund-supported program are very advanced. And those discussions include discussions around a sizable financing package,” she said, but underscored that the final decision over the deal amount would fall to the IMF board. Regarding the payment schedule, she said: “As with all of our programs, disbursements will come in tranches over the life of the program. But the exact phasing and the size of each tranche is also, of course, part of the discussions that are underway.” Caputo spoke about the deal during an insurance conference on Thursday morning. “The sum we’ve agreed on, that the staff will submit for the board’s approval, is US$20 billion,” he said. “As you can see, it’s much higher than the amount that was rumored.” The minister said the IMF did not place the usual fiscal, monetary, and reserve conditions on the deal. He did not specify whether the government’s current 1% monthly crawling peg — the rate at which it devalues the peso against the dollar — would remain in place. President Javier Milei also spoke following Caputo’s announcement. In an interview, he said that IMF Managing Director Kristalina Giorgieva authorized the minister to disclose the amount of the loan last night. Milei also emphatically ruled out the possibility of a devaluation, which market sources take for granted. He said that, after the new loan, there will be “a lack of pesos, not a lack of dollars.” Kozack said that the parties were in ongoing discussions over what policies would be covered by the program but added: “To sustain the gains that have been achieved so far by the authorities, there is a shared recognition about the need to continue to adopt a consistent set of fiscal, monetary, and foreign exchange policies while fostering further and furthering growth-enhancing reforms.” Additional packages Caputo also said that the government is negotiating an additional package with the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (also known as CAF) “to strengthen the Central Bank’s reserves.” Gross reserves, according to Caputo, will increase to US$50 billion thanks to these loans. The monetary base, he said, currently sits at US$25 billion at the official exchange rate and at US$20 billion at the blue-chip swap dollar rate. “We will have double the amount of reserves than the current monetary base.” “Although I can’t give you any more details of the rest of the agreement due to confidentiality clauses, I thought it was important to tell you about the amount,” Caputo said. “Our goal is that, in the future, we can get access to markets again and that Argentina can at least refinance the capital in such a way that reserves continue to back pesos in the Central Bank.” He continued: “Not only is it different from the over 20 previous deals Argentina has had with the IMF, but it is also different from any other deal the IMF has reached with other countries.” Caputo explained that while IMF deals typically consist of the lender making gradual disbursements while demanding fiscal and monetary adjustments to put the country’s economy “in order,” this is not the case for Argentina’s new agreement. “We’ve already carried out those fiscal and monetary adjustments,” he said. After Milei took office in December 2023, the new administration evaluated the possibility of seeking a new loan from the IMF, “which wouldn’t have happened because the Fund would not commit more capital without seeing concrete results,” Caputo said.  Another option was continuing the program from former President Alberto Fernández’s government. “If we focused on the goals fixed for the prior government, we couldn’t have stopped the crisis from happening. It wouldn’t have been enough to stop hyperinflation,” the minister added. In this scenario, Milei’s government decided to take on “much more challenging goals” and refrain from borrowing more money until the IMF was “convinced” that the administration would be able to comply with those goals. “That’s what we did. We ended the fiscal deficit in a month and ended monetary emission in six months,” Caputo said.",Caputo confirms US$20 billion deal between Argentina and IMF staff,Buenos Aires Herald,Buenos Aires Herald,2025-03-27T13:11:39,2025-03-27T19:33:04,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/wildfires/wildfires-continue-rage-carolinas-rcna198328,"The Table Rock wildfire burning in South Carolina continued to grow Thursday, but conditions that created dramatic expansion the day before eased, officials said. The fire, which was started March 21 by hikers, had burned an estimated 8,679 acres by 4:30 p.m. Thursday when a flight captured infrared data, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said. Hundreds of residents in North Carolina and South Carolina have been ordered to leave and structures have been destroyed in the fires, which are burning amid abnormally dry or drought conditions in both states. Downed timber left in the wake of Hurricane Helene, a devastating storm that struck in September, has also been fueling the fires' spread, officials have said. “The amount of downed debris and timber in the woods is almost indescribable,” Madeline Stewart, the South Carolina Forestry Commission Public Information Coordinator, said on NBC’s “TODAY” show. North Carolina fires In North Carolina, there are eight active wildfires in Caldwell, Buncombe, Polk, Jackson, Haywood and Swain counties, according to an interactive map by the North Carolina Forest Service. New fires sparked in dry conditions Wednesday, prompting Gov. Josh Stein to declare another state of emergency “to make sure we have every tool at our disposal” to respond to fires in the western part of the state. The worst blazes are the Black Cove Complex Fire and the Deep Woods Fire, both in Polk County and Henderson County. The Black Cove Complex fire has burned around 3,288 acres and was 17% contained Thursday evening, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture said in an update. The fire first ignited March 19 by a downed power line. ""Fire behavior has continued to be intense, with rapid fire spread and extreme burning conditions due to high winds and dry weather,"" the department said. But on the Deep Woods Fire, there was better news Thursday. There was progress on containment of that fire, which has burned an estimated 3,373 acres in size and was 30% contained by that evening, the department said. It was first reported March 19 and the cause is under investigation. A third fire that had prompted evacuation orders, the Fish Hook Fire, was 199 acres in size and 95% contained. Evacuation orders had previously been lifted. South Carolina fires In South Carolina, the Table Rock Fire and the Persimmon Ridge Fire were the two major wildfires in the state. The Persimmon Ridge Fire ""saw only modest expansion"" Thursday as conditions were milder than what was seen Wednesday, state officials said. The fire grew to 1,992 acres Thursday, but the state forestry department said most of that growth was from ""burnouts"" created by firefighters between existing fire breaks. The Table Rock Fire was started by “the negligent act of some hikers,"" the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office said last week. “The young men that are responsible for the fire have been identified. The investigation is continuing by agents and detectives with the sheriff’s office as well as those with the South Carolina Forestry Commission, and the appropriate charges will be discussed and made at a later date,” Sheriff Tommy Blankenship said in a March 21 statement. On Wednesday, the South Carolina Forestry commission called for the immediate evacuations of residents in Greenville and Pickens counties. “Never in my 52 years did I think would I be running from my home in a fire,” said Wendy Clarke, who evacuated her home in the Caesar's Head area near the Persimmon Ridge Fire to a local shelter.","Hurricane Helene aftermath fuels Carolina fires, prompting new warnings and evacuations","Marlene Lenthang, Phil Helsel",NBC News,2025-03-27T13:54:41.990Z,2025-03-27T23:45:36.699Z,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-france-macron-zelenskyy-coalition-willing-8f6f3e0afdfbdaa08a00d289c206bf4f,"PARIS (AP) — France and Britain will continue to forge ahead with plans to deploy troops in Ukraineto defend an eventual peace deal with Russia but only some other nations want to take part,French President Emmanuel Macronsaid Thursday after a summit of countries that have been mulling the proposal. The French leader said “several” nations other than France and Britain want to be part of the armed force but added, “It is not unanimous.” Paris and London say such a force would aim to secure any peace deal by dissuading Russia from attacking Ukraine again. “We do not need unanimity to achieve it,” Macron said. French and British military officials will work with Ukraine to determine where the contingents should be deployed and how many troops they’d need to be a credible deterrent, the French leader added. “There will be a reassurance force with several European nations that will deploy,” he insisted. The summit of leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs came at a crucial juncture in themore than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven bypressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. But fighting rages on. Before the leaders met in the luxury of the French presidential palace, Russian drone attacks overnight wounded more than 20 people and heavy shelling Thursday afternoon killed one person and knocked out electricity in parts of Kherson, Ukrainian officials said. Macron and other summit participants accused Russia of only pretending to want a negotiated settlement. “They are playing games and they’re playing for time,” said U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. “We can’t let them drag this out while they continue prosecuting their illegal invasion.” U.S.-brokered agreements this weekto safeguard shipping in the Black Seaand last week to haltlong-range strikes on energy infrastructurewere greeted as first steps toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of deal violations, foreshadowing a long and contentious process ahead. One reason why some European countries are balking at a potential deployment in Ukraine is because it’s unclear whether Trump would support such a contingent with air power and other military assistance. “This will require the engagement and support of the United States,” Starmer said. “That’s a discussion we’ve had with the president on many occasions.” Macron suggested they may have to do without U.S. backing. “You have to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst,” he said. “My hope is that the Americans will be on our side and that the Americans will support, even play an active role.” “But we have to be prepared for a situation where perhaps they won’t join in,” he added. Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent — U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops — would be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War butare now rearming. Starmer’s office said military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details, examining “the full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.” Greece publicly rejected sending troops. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said those discussions were “somewhat divisive” and distracted from the goal of ending the war as soon as possible. Italy’sPrime Minister Giorgia Melonialso reiterated that Rome won’t contribute troops to a possible military force to be deployed to Ukraine. She also underlined the importance of working with the U.S. on ending the conflict and called for the participation of an American delegation in the next coordination meeting. In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on Europe to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, the proposed contingent is seen as a test of the continent’s willingness to defend itself and its interests. While the U.S. has spearheaded ceasefire talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insisted that Europe, represented by Macron and Starmer, must also be at the negotiating table. “We do not consider any alternative,” he said. “This is our firm stance. Europe is vast, and it must have clear representation in these negotiations.” Summit participants were more in agreement that sanctions squeezing Russia’s economy must be continued, and even toughened, to force Moscow to negotiate in good faith. “Lifting sanctions on Russia right now would be a disaster for diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said. “Sanctions are one of the few real tools the world has to pressure Russia into serious talks.” Russia has demanded that sanctions be lifted to meet its terms for the Black Sea ceasefire. The White House said it would help restore Russia’s access to the world market for fertilizer and farm exports, but it didn’t validate Moscow’s conditions. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Russia’s demands would be evaluated and presented to Trump. Zelenskyy said: “They’re dragging out the talks and trying to get the U.S. stuck in endless, pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land.” As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine’s allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv’s hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression. Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support. Russian drone attacks overnight wounded at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a front-line community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram. Separately, the Ukrainian Army General Staff said that its attack at Engels military airfield in Russia on March 20 had destroyed 96 air-to-air cruise missiles and significant reserves of aviation fuel. Satellite imagery taken the next day by Maxar Technologies appeared to show damage to ammunition and weapons storage at Engels, the main base for Russia’s nuclear-capable strategic bombers. ___ Melley reported from London.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-847764,"Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanou was killed in an Israeli airstrike on northern Gaza, the IDF confirmed Thursday evening.
Al-Qanou was one of Hamas's most prominent spokesmen in Gaza, and while he avoided media appearances during the months of fighting, he gave multiple interviews to Arab news channels after the ceasefire.
Al-Qanou was killed when his tent was targeted in Jabaliya, the Hamas-run Al-Aqsa television reported. The same airstrike wounded several people, medical sources said.
Qatari-linked Al Araby Jadeed confirmed the death via sources in Gaza.
Who was al-Qanou?
According to Al Araby Jadeed, al-Qanou was born in Jabaliya, on April 24, 1981. He studied his undergraduate at the Islamic University of Gaza, followed by three masters degrees at universities in Gaza. The same report said al-Qanou had a doctorate in preaching and media from the University of Tripoli in Lebanon in 2019.
According to Al Araby Jadeed, al-Qanou joined the Hamas during the Second Intifada in 2000. After graudating university,
he was reportedly employed as media director at Hamas's media offices in the northern Gaza Strip, before becoming an official spokesman for the terror group in 2016.
Earlier this week, Israel killed Ismail Barhoum, a member of Hamas' political office, and Salah al-Bardaweel, another senior leader.
Both Bardaweel and Barhoum were members of the 20-member Hamas decision-making body - the political office - 11 of whom have been killed since the start of the war in late 2023, according to Hamas sources.
The IDF has yet to comment on the alleged elimination.
Increased IDF pressure in the Gaza Strip
Since fighting in Gaza was renewed at the beginning of last week, the IDF has killed 150 terrorists, including 10 top Hamas officials, The Jerusalem Post learned Tuesday.
In certain areas, the military has entered a full kilometer into Gaza, such as around the Nitzanim Corridor in central Gaza.
In addition to central Gaza, Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, parts of Khan Yunis, Shaboura, and Tel Sultan, the IDF has been evacuating and moving into Jabaliya.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4vjwzv22eo,"Germany has said it ""will not give in"" and that Europe must ""respond firmly"" as US President Donald Trump targets imported cars and car parts with a 25% tax in his latest tariffs. Other major world economies have vowed to retaliate, with France's president branding the move ""a waste of time"" and ""incoherent"", Canada calling it a ""direct attack"", and China accusing Washington of violating international trade rules. Carmaker stocks from Japan to Germany dipped. In the US, General Motors dropped 7%, while Ford fell more than 2%. Trump has threatened to impose ""far larger"" tariffs if Europe works with Canada to do what he describes as ""economic harm"" to the US. The fresh car tariffs will come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later. Trump has long maintained the tariffs are part of a drive to help US manufacturing and says if cars are made in America there will be ""absolutely no tariff"". Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. While the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for companies reliant on parts from abroad. The firms that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers. The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (Â£186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales. Mexico is the top supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany. Analysts have estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the European Union must ""respond firmly"". ""It must be clear that we will not give in to the US. We need to show strength and self-confidence,"" he added. France backed this joint approach, with its finance minister saying Europe must retaliate with tariffs on US products. At a press conference on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was ""not the time"" for the US to be imposing tariffs. ""Imposing tariffs means breaking value chains, it means creating in the short term an inflationary effect and destroying jobs,"" he said in Paris. ""All of this is rather a waste of time and will create a lot of worry,"" he added, urging Trump to reconsider. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a ""direct attack"" on his country and its car industry, adding it ""will hurt us"", but trade options were being discussed. In the UK, car industry body the SMMT said the car tariffs announcement was ""not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing"". Uniparts founder John Neill said the Trump tariffs were ""a gift to the Chinese"", because international consumers would respond to a trade war by buying Chinese alternatives. Meanwhile, China accused Trump of violating World Trade Organization rules. ""There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war. No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs,"" a spokesman for the foreign ministry said. There are warnings from Japan that there will be a ""significant impact"" on the economic relationship it shares with the US. A government spokesman described the measures as ""extremely regrettable"" and said officials had asked the US for an exemption. In South Korea, a day before the latest levy,Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (Â£16.3bn) in the USand build a new steel plant in Louisiana. Trump hailed the investment as a ""clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work"". Bosch - based in Germany - said it had confidence in the ""long-term potential"" of the North American market and would continue to expand its business there. The International Monetary Fund said it was not projecting a US recession, but warned a trade war could have a ""significant adverse effect"" on Canada and Mexico's economic outlooks. BBC Verify has looked into some of the claims made by the US president during his speech in Michigan. The university pledges to review its policies, though the proposals appear to fall short of White House demands. He tells a crowd in Michigan that he is using his presidency to deliver ""profound change"". The victims at the YNOT After School Camp are believed to range in age from seven to 18, authorities say.

One reason why some European countries are balking at a potential deployment in Ukraine is because it’s unclear whether Trump would support such a contingent with air power and other military assistance. “This will require the engagement and support of the United States,” Starmer said. “That’s a discussion we’ve had with the president on many occasions.” Macron suggested they may have to do without U.S. backing. “You have to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst,” he said. “My hope is that the Americans will be on our side and that the Americans will support, even play an active role.” “But we have to be prepared for a situation where perhaps they won’t join in,” he added. Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent — U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops — would be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War butare now rearming. Starmer’s office said military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details, examining “the full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.” Greece publicly rejected sending troops. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said those discussions were “somewhat divisive” and distracted from the goal of ending the war as soon as possible. Italy’sPrime Minister Giorgia Melonialso reiterated that Rome won’t contribute troops to a possible military force to be deployed to Ukraine. She also underlined the importance of working with the U.S. on ending the conflict and called for the participation of an American delegation in the next coordination meeting. In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on Europe to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, the proposed contingent is seen as a test of the continent’s willingness to defend itself and its interests. While the U.S. has spearheaded ceasefire talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insisted that Europe, represented by Macron and Starmer, must also be at the negotiating table. “We do not consider any alternative,” he said. “This is our firm stance. Europe is vast, and it must have clear representation in these negotiations.” Summit participants were more in agreement that sanctions squeezing Russia’s economy must be continued, and even toughened, to force Moscow to negotiate in good faith. “Lifting sanctions on Russia right now would be a disaster for diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said. “Sanctions are one of the few real tools the world has to pressure Russia into serious talks.” Russia has demanded that sanctions be lifted to meet its terms for the Black Sea ceasefire. The White House said it would help restore Russia’s access to the world market for fertilizer and farm exports, but it didn’t validate Moscow’s conditions. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Russia’s demands would be evaluated and presented to Trump. Zelenskyy said: “They’re dragging out the talks and trying to get the U.S. stuck in endless, pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land.” As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine’s allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv’s hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression. Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support. Russian drone attacks overnight wounded at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a front-line community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram. Separately, the Ukrainian Army General Staff said that its attack at Engels military airfield in Russia on March 20 had destroyed 96 air-to-air cruise missiles and significant reserves of aviation fuel. Satellite imagery taken the next day by Maxar Technologies appeared to show damage to ammunition and weapons storage at Engels, the main base for Russia’s nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",French president says not all European allies agree on a proposed force for Ukraine,"John Leicester, Samuel Petrequin, Brian Melley",AP News,2025-03-27T10:50:20,2025-03-27T19:04:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-crisis-recep-tayyip-erdogan-ekrem-imamoglu-arrest-eu-accession-funds/,"BRUSSELS — The European Union is set to keep pumping billions of euros into Turkey despite President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s sweeping crackdown on political opponents. Brussels warned its southern neighbor to “uphold democratic values” after authorities there arrested opposition leader Ekrem İmamoğlu over the weekend. But Turkey’s strategic importance means the bloc will likely end up turning a blind eye.   And Erdoğan knows it. As far as the Turkish leader is concerned, “whatever he does, the EU will have to tag along with it,” said Dimitar Bechev, a lecturer at the University of Oxford. Two European officials, granted anonymity to speak about closed-door talks, told POLITICO that Turkey’s status as an EU candidate obliges it to uphold democratic values, and that Brussels will respond to violations. “We are following the evolving situation in Turkey with great concern,” one of them said. With more than a thousand people, including journalists, detained by security forces since the unrest began last week, “the latest developments go against the very logic of EU accession.”  However, given Turkey’s importance on migration, trade, energy and defense, any response from the EU is unlikely to upend relations between Brussels and Ankara, the other conceded. Turkey applied to join the EU in 1999. Although talks have come to a standstill over the past decade, the country still receives billions in accession funds. Ankara has also received some €9 billion in aid to host refugees from the Middle East, and is in line for vast sums of money to support European defense industries. Now an important hub for oil and gas exports, Turkey enjoys trade flows with the EU worth more than €200 billion annually. Since Russia’s full-blown invasion of Ukraine in 2022 it has also been key to controlling access to the Black Sea and to enforcing sanctions against Moscow. It has recently been mooted as a major contributor to any eventual peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. “The status quo before İmamoğlu’s arrest was comfortable for the EU because there was just enough democracy,” Bechev said. Recent developments, he added, aren’t grave enough to change that. The best defense As an EU candidate country, Turkey can potentially access joint procurements worth €800 billion from funds designed to boost the bloc’s defense spending, according to the Readiness 2030 plan presented by EU leaders last week. However, Greece and Cyprus — both in long-running conflicts with Turkey — are pushing for restrictions, with diplomats telling POLITICO they intend to enforce a clause that would require the defense push to happen “without prejudice to the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.” With its NATO-trained armed forces and vast military-industrial complex, though, Ankara is convinced these objections will be overruled. If Europeans “want Turkish participation in certain areas — for example, sending troops to Ukraine in the future — then they will have to give access to Turkey,” said Turkey’s former Ambassador to the EU Selim Yenel. Yenel said the domestic situation was dire — “there is no law” left in Turkey, he claimed — but predicted that “since it seems that the EU needs Turkey, they will not put pressure on us.” Regarding the Western values countries must uphold for accession, he said, Erdoğan “is playing lip service to that.” Troubled waters Greece and Cyprus must now perform a delicate balancing act, having been in the process of normalizing relations with Ankara before the latest political crisis. “We will, of course, support a rigorous position condemning the current developments in Turkey, but without being the trigger,” said a senior Greek official, acknowledging that even Athens couldn’t go too far. “The defense industry remains a big gap for Europe, and this paves the way for this trade-off policy that we see taking place.” Cyprus is also in a difficult position, as Turkey appeared to strike a far more conciliatory tone during last week’s informal talks on the Cyprus problem held in Geneva. “Effective pressure from the EU is essential,” said Cypriot MEP Michalis Hadjipantela, calling for “targeted sanctions.” But at the same time, “measures should be targeted and linked to progress on the above issues in order to avoid further alienating the country, which would lead to more provocative policies.”",EU faces billion-euro dilemma over Turkey crisis,"Gabriel Gavin, Jacopo Barigazzi, Nektaria Stamouli",POLITICO,2025-03-27T03:01:00,2025-03-26T23:44:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-claims-growing-gaza-protests-against-its-rule-actually-aimed-at-israel/,"Hamas responded Thursday to growing public protests inside Gaza by insisting the demonstrations are directed against Israel and the ongoing war, rather than against the terror group ruling the Strip. Thousands of Gazans have taken to the streets this week in rare displays of public anger against Hamas, chanting for the end of the group’s nearly two-decade rule after it plunged the enclave into war by attacking southern Israel on October 7, taking hundreds of hostages, many of whom it is still holding. Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told the Qatari channel Al-Araby that “demonstrations are expected from people facing extermination, against war and destruction.” Despite multiple media reports, images, and videos from protests, as well as media interviews with Gazans to the contrary, Naim claimed the rallies are being misrepresented as criticizing Hamas’s de facto regime. “People are calling to stop the aggression, but the enemy and other parties with political agendas are diverting the spontaneous protests to serve the occupation’s agenda and trying to portray it as if the demonstrators are against the resistance,” he said — a reference to Hamas and other terror groups in Gaza. “Those who are trying to portray the protests as demonstrations against Hamas are the same people who have been doing this for years from Arab and European cities to serve (foreign) interests,” he added, without specifying which actors he was referring to. Naim further claimed that the authoritarian Islamist group allows residents to show dissent. “We understand well that our people are politically diverse, and we protect both opinions and opposing views,” he said.Â “No one has the right to forbid anyone from expressing their opinion. But the people took to the streets calling to stop the war and end the aggression.” On Wednesday, thousands of people rallied throughout Gaza, chanting “Hamas out.” The protest followed a smaller demonstration a day earlier in Beit Lahiya, north of Gaza City, which drew wide media attention. Some protest participants spoke directly to the media Wednesday, criticizing Hamas over the war. “They made the residents into rabbits, and now they have broken free of the fear because they have nothing to lose,” a Gazan man named Sami Ubayed told Israel’s Ynet news outlet. “Residents have no water or electricity. Hamas is destroying Gaza and making us into stones, they must be removed from power. We won’t stop demonstrating, Hamas needs to be flexible and release the hostages.” Demonstrators carrying banners reading, “Hamas does not represent us,” were seen marching in Gaza City and the town of Beit Lahiya in the north of the territory. In Beit Lahiya, where a similar but far smaller protest took place Tuesday, about 3,000 people demonstrated Wednesday, with many chanting, “The people want the fall of Hamas.” In the hard-hit Shejaiyeh neighborhood of Gaza City, dozens of men chanted, “Out, out out! Hamas get out!” In some incidents, protesters at rallies urged Hamas to release hostages it is holding to expedite an end to the war that has devastated most areas of Gaza, making conditions harsh for residents. War erupted on October 7, 2023, when Hamas led some 5,000 attackers to invade southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. As they rampaged murderously through the region, the terrorists abducted 251 people, also mostly civilians, who were taken as hostages to the Gaza Strip. Israel retaliated with a military campaign to destroy Hamas and save the hostages. A complex, three-phase ceasefire that included the release of hostages in batches began on January 19 but collapsed after its first stage as Israel renewed air strikes amid mutual accusations of violations and as Hamas stopped releasing hostages. The terror group has violently cracked down on previous protests. This time, no outright intervention was apparent, which some saw as a sign of its waning power in the wake of Israel’s military campaign. The group’s armed personnel are also thought to be keeping a low profile since Israel resumed military action in Gaza earlier this month following the two-month ceasefire. Protests are relatively rare events in Gaza, especially against Hamas, which has maintained an iron grip on the Strip since it violently ousted the Palestinian Authority from the territory in 2007. While there have been more public statements by individuals in Gaza against Hamas rule since the war started, large-scale demonstrations against the group have been almost nonexistent. The last documented protest in the Strip against Hamas took place in January 2024, when Palestinians in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis called for an end to the war, the end of the terror group’s rule over Gaza, and the release of the Israeli hostages. Before the war, anti-Hamas protests were also relatively rare events and were often suppressed violently by the terror group. Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm, and send its leaders into exile. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a complete end to war, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas won a landslide victory in Gaza in the last Palestinian elections, held in 2006. It seized power in Gaza from the PA, which is based in the West Bank and dominated by the secular Fatah movement, the following year after months of factional unrest and a week of heavy street battles. Rights groups say both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas violently suppress dissent, quashing protests in the areas they control and jailing and torturing critics.",Hamas claims growing Gaza protests against its rule actually aimed at Israel,"Nurit Yohanan, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-03-27T09:48:11,2025-03-27T09:48:11,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-847639,"The Knesset approved on Thursday a bill proposal that dramatically amends the committee responsible for electing Israel’s judges, by increasing political involvement in judicial appointments at the expense of professional involvement. The bill is a watered-down version of one of the central components of the government’s 2023 judicial reforms, and marks a significant achievement for the reforms architect, Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Knesset Constitution Committee chairman MK Simcha Rothman. The Judicial Selection Committee’s makeup since 1953 has included nine members – three High Court judges, two ministers, two members of Knesset (traditionally one coalition and one opposition), and two representatives of the Israel Bar Association (IBA). According to the new proposal, which will apply beginning with the next Knesset, the two IBA members will be replaced by two “public representatives”, one appointed by the coalition and the other by the opposition. The public representatives must have the qualifications to be appointed as a High Court judge. In addition, according to the proposal, the majority necessary for High Court appointments will revert back to 5-4 instead of the current 7-2. However, every High Court appointment will require the agreement of at least one representative from the opposition and one from the coalition (or their respective public representatives). Appointments to all other judicial brackets will require approval of one member of the coalition, one from the opposition, and one of the judges. The proposal also includes a mechanism to prevent a deadlock in High Court appointments. If a year passes with at least two vacancies, the coalition and opposition will each propose three candidates, out of which the other side must choose one (along with the judges). The justice minister may only use this “deadlock mechanism” once per Knesset term. Finally, at least two thirds of the judges on the High Court must previously have been Regional Court judges. A draft of the current version was first presented on January 9 as a “compromise” between Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, and earned the support of two bereaved fathers, former minister Yizhar Shai and former Fire and Rescue Service head Dedi Simchi. Shai has since reneged on his support of the bill. The Sa’ar-Levin compromise included another component, that was not included in the legislation that passed on Thursday: Permanently limiting the power of the executive and legislative branches to arbitrarily pass quasi-constitutional basic laws for narrow, short-term, personal, and overtly political goals. Sa’ar said that this element was not included because it did not enjoy enough support in the coalition. Proponents of the bill argued that it was a worthy compromise, since it did not give the coalition total power over judicial appointments, and will only apply in the next Knesset. However, its detractors, including the opposition, the Attorney-General’s Office, and a wide array of civil society organizations, argued that increasing political involvement in the judicial selection process will negatively affect the court’s independence, as judicial appointments will become part of political negotiations. The bill became law exactly two years after the initial version stalled, following a warning by then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that the schism over the bill was harming national security. Netanyahu promptly fired Gallant, which ignited mass protests in what became known as “the Night of Gallant”. 67 Members of Knesset voted in favor of the bill, with one opposing. Members of the opposition parties walked out during the third reading, leaving the plenum half empty. ""We made history tonight,"" Levin said. ""The Supreme Court, through a process that has been accelerating for decades, has effectively nullified the Knesset."" ""I stand here today on your behalf, after decades in which your voice was not heard and your vote at the ballot box was trampled. We are opening a new chapter. The days of surrender and silence are over, never to return,"" he further stated. Knesset Constitution Committee head MK Simcha Rothman affirmed the bill ""is a crucial step in restoring the balance between the branches of government and returning decision-making power to the people of Israel."" ""The outline approved by the Knesset reflects an evolutionary and balanced change, based on our constitutional tradition,"" Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said. Opposition party heads noted following the vote, ""The Israeli government has just approved a law with a single purpose – to ensure that judges become subservient to the will of politicians."" ""This is happening while 59 hostages are still being held in Gaza. Instead of focusing all efforts on bringing them home and healing the nation’s wounds, this government is once again advancing the very legislation that divided the public before October 7."" They added they would ensure the bill ""is repealed"" in ""the next government."" Yesh Atid and the Movement for Quality of Government subsequently submitted a petition against the bill to the High Court of Justice. The votes came after the opposition attempted a parliamentary “hail mary” following an all-night filibuster. At approximately 5:00 a.m., the opposition removed all of its speakers in order to immediately begin voting. The move was an attempt to surprise the coalition and catch it unprepared, as initially voting was only scheduled to begin at approximately 9:00 a.m. The move failed, however, as Levin and Knesset Constitution Committee chairman MK Simcha Rothman drew out their closing speeches in order to enable all of the coalition’s MKs to make it to the plenum.

For his part, the Polish prime minister thanked the NATO chief for his support of Shield East, a project planned between 2024 and 2028 to strengthen Poland's resilience to potential attacks and a hybrid war. The project was developed at the Polish Ministry of National Defence in response to Russian aggression against Ukraine and the growing threat from Russia. ""We take full responsibility as Poland for the security of Poland's eastern border but also of our European and NATO partners. For me, it is also very important to have a high assessment from the Nato secretary general of this project,"" Tusk said ""We have such and not a different geography; we have such and not a different history; we have a determination like no other NATO country today when it comes to investing in our defense,"" the head of the Polish government added.

https://apnews.com/article/china-france-foreign-ministry-economy-ukraine-trade-969ced6576ca477b85b0b3424bdbf6f8,"BEIJING (AP) — French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot began a two-day visit to China on Thursday and held talks with his Chinese counterpart on Ukraine and longstanding trade disputes between China and Europe. There was no word of any immediate progress, but both sides sounded positive on the state of relations. Barrot met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who said in a news conference afterward that both countries should “choose multilateralism over unilateralism ... and pursue mutual benefit and win-win outcomes instead of decoupling and isolation.” That echoed language frequently used by China in criticizing U.S. foreign policy and the Western-led political order. Barrot later met with Premier Li Qiang, who said: “As we all know, the world is currently not peaceful, and instability and uncertainty are increasing.” “As two independent and responsible major countries, China and France should strengthen cooperation. Through our cooperation, we should inject more certainty into bilateral relations and the world,” Li said. Barrot responded that the world was “indeed going through troubled times where a number of major principles, particularly those of multilateralism, are being shaken.” “In this context, a new Europe is rapidly emerging, its only compass being strategic autonomy. This new Europe is investing massively in its defense, in energy,” the minister said before reporters were escorted from the room. On Friday, Barrot will travel to Shanghai for meetings with local officials and business leaders. France has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its struggle against Russia’s invasion, while Beijing has backed Russia diplomatically and provided an economic lifeline by buying Russian natural resources. Barrot’s visit is an opportunity to gauge China’s attitude on Ukraine ahead of a major French-hosted meeting on a possible peacekeeping force for the country. The talks come as fissures are showing between the U.S. and Europe over support for Ukraine, with Washington increasingly seen as backing Moscow. French President François Macron said Wednesday that a proposed European armed force could be deployed in Ukraine in under an eventual peace deal, and could “respond” to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one. Europe has long complained of unfair Chinese trade practices that it says force European companies to take on Chinese partners, share business practices and result in a major Chinese trade surpluses. The sides also issued a joint statement reaffirming cooperation on climate change marking the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, saying “the agreement and its long-term goals even more requires all parties to inject political impetus into the international cooperation on jointly fighting climate change (and) protecting biodiversity and ecosystems.” China is both the largest producer and consumer of fossil fuels, mainly coal. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has started the one-year process to once again pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement and, formalizing another withdrawal from both climate and foreign aid programs, the Trump administration has told world financial institutions that the U.S is pulling out of the international climate Loss and Damage Fund.

This is the third facility of its kind to be revealed in under a month. Major General Mohammad Bagheri, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, and Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC Aerospace Forces were filmed traveling through the facility lined with hundreds of missiles.

The footage also revealed Bagheri stepping on an Israeli flag placed on the ground of the facility. 
“Iran’s iron fist is far stronger than before. 10 times stronger than True Promise I,” Bagheri claimed. “All the [defensive] dimensions that are required for generating a [military] capability that is 10 times [stronger than] the one deployed during Operation True Promise II, has been created…The enemy will definitely fall behind in this balance of power.”
‘True Promise II” references Iran’s April attack on Israel. The facility’s ""unveiling comes amid escalating threats and blatant warmongering from the Donald Trump administration and the Israeli regime, prompting Iran to showcase its military preparedness to defend the homeland,” according to Iranian state media Press TV.

The officer was identified as Osmar Rodarte. He was 27. During a news conference, Yuba County District Attorney Clint Curry said multiple law enforcement agencies on Wednesday launched 20 search warrants across Yuba, Sutter, Tehama and Butte counties as a result of a years-long investigation into drug trafficking.

Both officer Rodarte and the gunman were hurt in the shootout. Anderson said first responders took Rodarte to the Adventist Health and Rideout hospital, where he later died of his injuries.

Ambassador Hwang Joon-kook made the remarks, renewing Seoul's calls for Moscow and Pyongyang to end their miliary cooperation that has deepened following their ""comprehensive strategic partnership"" treaty, which North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed in June last year. ""This war has inflicted serious suffering not only on the Ukrainian people, and Russian soldiers and their families, but also on those of North Korea,"" he said during a U.N. Security Council meeting on the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine. He noted that interviews with North Korean troops, captured in Russia's front-line Kursk region, have revealed they were deceived by the North Korean leadership to believe that they were sent to Russia for training, not to fight in a war. ""Reportedly, their families remain unaware that their sons have been sent abroad to engage in another country's deadly conflict until the authorities issue a certificate of death. Pyongyang even compelled the bereaved families to sign non-disclosure agreements regarding the loss of lives,"" he said, Hwang went on to say, ""Pyongyang must stop sacrificing its own people to sustain the regime in exchange for military, political and economic support from Moscow.""

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/wildfires-ravaging-southern-south-korea-leave-24-dead-force-thousands-to-evacuate,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea’s worst ever have ravaged the country’s southern regions, killing 24 people, destroying more than 300 structures and forcing 28,800 residents to evacuate, officials said Wednesday. The death toll included a pilot who died after a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a blaze in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the hardest-hit areas. The aircraft had no other crew members. Police said that most of the dead are those in their 60s and 70s. READ MORE: Wildfires in Japan force residents to evacuate homes in mountains The National Fire Agency said at least 26 people sustained varying degrees of injuries. An ancient Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 17,752 hectares (43,866 acres), the government’s emergency response center said. In a televised address, South Korea’s acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were worse than many previous ones. “Damages are snowballing,” Han said. “There are concerns that we’ll have wildfire damages that we’ve never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week.” Han said crews struggled to extinguish the wildfires because strong winds swept the areas overnight. He also said about 4,650 firefighters, soldiers and other personnel were working Wednesday with the help of about 130 helicopters, adding that “a small amount” of 5-10 millimeters (0.1-0.3 inches) of rain was expected Thursday. As of Wednesday evening, firefighters were tackling at least six active wildfires, including in the southeastern coastal town of Yeongdeok, which alerted residents of the nearest village to evacuate to an indoor gymnasium. Strong winds and smoke-filled skies forced authorities in the southeastern city of Andong to order evacuations in two villages, including Puncheon, home to the Hahoe folk village — a UNESCO World Heritage Site founded around the 14th-15th century. Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri Mountain, one of the country’s largest national parks, as another fire spread closer. Observers say the ongoing wildfires are the third biggest in South Korea’s history in terms of land burned. The largest fires were in Andong, the neighboring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan. On Tuesday, officials said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again. The blaze in Uiseong destroyed about 20 of the 30 buildings and structures at Gounsa, a temple said to be originally built in the 7th century. Among the burned structures were two state-designated “treasures” — a pavilion-shaped building erected overlooking a stream in 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king. Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry said it protectively removed 500 inmates from a detention center in Cheongsong, another southern town, but no damages were reported to the facility. The Korea Forest Service said it had raised its wildfire warning to the highest level nationwide, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises. Among the dead were four firefighters and government workers who died in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds, according to officials. Government officials suspect human error caused several of the fires, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.","Wildfires ravaging southern South Korea leave 24 dead, force thousands to evacuate","Kim Tong-Hyung, Associated Press, Hyung-Jin Kim, Associated Press",PBS News,2025-03-26T15:50:30,2025-03-26T15:50:30,gemini-2.0-flash

Zuhair Qarout emphasized at a news conference in Damascus the catastrophic effect of the medication shortage on thousands of patients and their families across Syria. He described the shortage as a true public health and humanitarian crisis affecting some of the most vulnerable and fragile groups in society. Qarout urged the UN, World Health Organization, UNICEF, EU humanitarian aid agencies, and friendly and brotherly countries, as well as international NGOs, to provide necessary pharmaceutical support so Syria can continue to treat cancer patients. He stressed the urgent need to ease international restrictions to remove barriers hindering the import of medications. Bashar Assad, Syria’s leader for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia after anti-regime groups took control of Damascus on Dec. 8, ending the Baath Party regime, which had been in power since 1963.

https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-vladimir-putin-attack-poland-response-devastating/,"WARSAW — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Wednesday stressed that the transatlantic military alliance would respond to an attack with “full force.” “When it comes to the defense of Poland and the general defense of NATO territory, if anyone were to miscalculate and think they can get away with an attack on Poland or any other ally, they will be met with the full force of this fierce alliance,” Rutte		
said		
at a press conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk during a visit to Warsaw. “Our reaction will be devastating. This must be clear to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and anyone else who wants to attack us,” Rutte added, praising Poland for spending 4.7 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, the highest level in the alliance. ""Let's not forget that Russia is and remains the most significant and dark threat to our alliance. Let's not forget that Russia is moving to a wartime economy,"" Rutte said. Tusk underlined the importance of NATO to his country's security. ""It’s very important for us		[to hear]		the commitment		that		NATO		will		defend Poland in any critical situation,” he said, referring to the alliance’s common defense Article 5. The reassurances come as there is growing worry within the alliance about United States President Donald Trump's commitment to NATO and the disdain expressed by him and his top officials about Europe. However, Rutte insisted that the transatlantic relationship between the U.S. and Europe is “the pillar of our alliance and that’s not changing.” Poland has also built its security on its close relationship with the U.S. and has been careful not to cross Trump. However, there is concern about the peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia led by the U.S. administration, which Tusk admitted ""we can only influence to a limited extent, to put it mildly."" ""We, as Poland and NATO, must be ready for scenarios we don’t really write,"" he said. Poland has been a key ally of Ukraine and sees that country's continued survival as crucial to its national security. ""No one wants peace more than		we do		but only		a		just peace will give us all a sense of security. It’s a condition for the security of Poland, Europe, and NATO,” Tusk said. Poland is also beefing up its own defenses, spending €2.3 billion on the East Shield initiative, a series of fortifications on its borders with Russia and Belarus — a project that has been		backed by the European Union. “Poland is taking full responsibility for securing its eastern border, which is the border of the EU as well,"" the Polish prime minister said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93n05z48ldo,"Russia has said some Western sanctions must be lifted before it begins a maritime ceasefire with Ukraine. Within hours of the US announcing the two sides had agreed to halt strikes in the Black Sea in separate deals, the Kremlin said it would only take place once sanctions on a number of Russian banks were lifted. The demands include revoking sanctions on the state agricultural bank Rosselkhozbank and restoring the firms' access to the Swift international payment system. Overnight, Moscow launched a drone attack on the port city of Mykolaiv, Ukrainian officials said, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the strikes were ""a clear signal"" Russia did not want peace. After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU and its allies suspended access to Swift for a number of Russian financial institutions. The aim was for Russian companies to lose access to the normal smooth and instant transactions provided by Swift, disrupting payments for its valuable energy and agricultural exports. Reversing that decision would need EU approval, a step that would appear uncertain in light of recent European statements of support for Kyiv. A European Commission spokesperson said the withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukraine would be one of the main conditions to lift or amend any sanctions. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said that Russia could be trying to delay ending the war. ""I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they're dragging their feet. I've done it over the years,"" he said in an interview with Newsmax. The maritime ceasefire was announced by the US after three days of peace talks in Saudi Arabia. However Kyiv and Moscow later released conflicting statements on the details of the deal, including when and how it would start. Zelensky said he believed the deal did not require sanctions relief to come into force and would take effect immediately. He called the Kremlin's statement an attempt to ""manipulate"" the deals. The Black Sea has not been a central focus of fighting for some time. In the first stages of the war, Ukraine successfully targeted Russia's fleet in its Crimean home ports and as of last summer, Ukraine said it had destroyed 28 Russian vessels. With what was left of the Russian fleet fleeing south and east to Russian and Abkhazian ports, Ukraine has been successfully exporting goods - with grain exports at near pre-war levels - via shipping which hugged the western seaboard of the Black Sea. So any maritime ceasefire – if it comes into force – is unlikely to reshape the balance of the war that is largely being fought on the ground. But Dr Jenny Mathers, a senior professor of international politics at Aberystwyth University and expert on Russian politics, said the maritime ceasefire would provide Russia with a ""big advantage"" as it was currently struggling to export its agricultural produce. ""Ukraine has managed to get out a lot of its agricultural produce through the Black Sea, and it's managed to successfully target Russian shipping, so Russia doesn't use the Black Sea at the moment,"" Dr Mathers said. The Black Sea Grain Initiative was struck in 2022, allowing safe passage of commercial ships travelling to and from Ukraine, with UN officials helping Russia get its food and fertiliser exports to foreign markets in return. Russia withdrew from the agreement in summer 2023, arguing that financial sanctions were hindering its exports, and said it would view any vessel bound for Ukraine as a potential military target. The UN said on Wednesday that freedom of navigation in the Black Sea was a ""crucial contribution to global food security and supply chains"". A spokesperson said the UN was working with Russia to facilitate its food and fertiliser exports. Where a maritime ceasefire could make a difference is by protecting Ukrainian ports from Russian air strikes. ""For us, a ceasefire is primarily a cessation of shelling of civilian port infrastructure,"" said Dmytro Pletenchuk, the Ukrainian navy spokesperson. ""As of now, we're in control of the situation at sea; in the Black Sea, in the Azov Sea, and in the waters surrounding temporarily occupied Crimea. That's why for us, the Ukrainian navy, this situation would not really change anything."" After announcing the agreement on Tuesday, Washington said all parties would continue working towards a ""durable and lasting peace"", adding that the agreement would reopen an important trade route. Ukraine and Russia also committed to ""develop measures"" to implement a previously agreed ban on attacking each other's energy infrastructure, the White House said. The Black Sea is located south of Ukraine and to the west of Russia, and is also bordered by Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Georgia. It is also bordered by parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine - including Crimea.",Russia says sanctions must be lifted before Ukraine maritime ceasefire can start,"Jake Lapham, James Landale",BBC News,2025-03-26T06:52:09,2025-03-26T12:59:22,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/serbia-sonic-attack-protest-vucic-weapon-214ff2630733b68dd2987e411b405197,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Ivana Ilic Sunderic had never heard anything quite so alarming and disturbing at a protest as the sound that broke a commemorative silence during a huge anti-government rally in Serbia’s capital, Belgrade. “It was quiet and peaceful and then we heard something we could not see … like a sound rolling toward us, a whiz,” Ilic Sunderic said about the March 15 incident. “People started rushing for safety toward the pavement, feeling that something was moving toward us down the street.” It was “a subdued sound lasting only 2-3 seconds but very unusual and very frightening, like a sound from hell,” she said. Ilic Sunderic was not alone in describing the panic. Hundreds of others have offered similar accounts, triggering accusations that the police, military or security services under the tight control of authoritarian Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic used an acoustic crowd control weapon to target peaceful protesters. The weapons, which are illegal in Serbia, emit sound waves which can trigger sharp ear pain, disorientation, eardrum ruptures or even irreversible hearing damage. The incident piled more pressure on Vucic, who has been rattled by nearly five months of anti-corruption protests over the collapse in November of a concrete canopy at a railway station in the northern town of Novi Sad that killed 16 people. Serbia’s officials have issued often contradictory denials that an acoustic weapon was directed at the demonstrators. Calls have been mounting for answers as to what caused the sudden commotion, if not a sonic device. An Associated Press video shows thousands of protesters holding up their lit mobile phones in silence when they suddenly start running away in panic. A swooshing sound can then be heard. “I have been going to protests for 30 years but I’ve never heard anything like this,” Ilic Sunderic said. Lies and fabrications A defiant Vucic has rejected what he called “lies and fabrications” that the security services targeted the demonstrators with a sonic device. He said that such accusations are part of an alleged Western-orchestrated ploy to topple him. “If there was a single piece of evidence that a sound cannon was used against demonstrators, then I would no longer be president,” he said. Serbia’s police, army and the state security agency, BIA, initially all denied possessing the U.S.-made Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD), which is illegal in Serbia and some other countries. When presented with photos of the device mounted on an off-road vehicle and deployed at the rally of hundreds of thousands of protesters, officials admitted possessing a sonic weapon, but insisted it was not used against the protesters. The photos showed nothing more than “loudspeakers” that also are available on eBay, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said. The rectangular devices, purchased from a U.S. supplier in 2021, serve to emit warnings to the crowds in case of major trouble, he said. “Serbian police have never, including March 15, used any illegal or unallowed device that is not envisaged by the law, including the device known as a sound cannon,” Dacic said. “Police only use sound devices for warnings.” Sonic weapons use sound waves to incapacitate, disorient or harm individuals by harnessing acoustic energy, causing both physical and psychological effects, such as dizziness, disorientation or severe headaches. Experts doubt the official version Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare, radar and military communications at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said he reviewed some of the videos from the Belgrade stampede. “Extraordinary film of people gathering, protesting in the streets peacefully, the demonstration,” he said in an interview. “And suddenly, an almost kind of biblical passing of a huge number of people in a very panicked rush, very sudden and very panicked movement, and the likes of which I must confess I’ve never seen before.” He said it was clear that something caused several hundred people to suddenly panic and move in a very specific way, rushing for cover to the pavement and abandoning the middle of the street. “So certainly, the behavior that you see on the film does appear to be consistent with people reacting en masse to something that is making them feel deeply unsettled or deeply uncomfortable,” he said. Reports also have emerged of pressure on doctors at Serbia’s emergency clinics to withhold records of hundreds of people who sought medical help and advice after the rally. Predrag Petrovic, a research manager at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, a think tank, said, “We can claim with huge probability that some unconventional weapon, some version of a sonic cannon, was used.” “I have a lot of experience in participating and monitoring street protests and I have never seen a stampede happen in a second and along an almost straight line,” Petrovic said. In an online petition signed by over half a million people, the Serbian opposition Move-Change movement asked the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for an independent investigation. Several Serbian rights groups announced Tuesday they have taken the issue to the European Court of Human Rights, saying that they collected more than 4,000 testimonies from people who complained of various physical and psychological problems after the incident on March 15. The court in Strasbourg has given Serbia until the end of the month to respond, the groups said in a joint statement. Vucic’s pro-Russia government, however, invited the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Russia’s Federal Security Service, the FSB, to investigate.

https://apnews.com/article/britain-inflation-economy-labour-79d215bf9f48551e8797c1dcddb8753c,"LONDON (AP) — The British economy will only grow by 1% this year, half the rate previously anticipated, Treasury chief Rachel Reeves conceded Wednesday in a statement to lawmakers about the state of the public finances that saw her trim spending so she could meet her self-imposed borrowing rules. Against that sluggish economic backdrop that she blamed on “global uncertainty,” but which critics say she is largely responsible for, Reeves insisted that it was imperative that the government lived within its means. Doing so, she said, was “an embodiment of this government’s unwavering commitment to bring stability to our economy.” Reeves’ statement came after the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, or OBR, found a 14 billion-pound ($18 billion) shortfall in light of the growth shortfall and higher debt interest payments. Reeves, whose official title is Chancellor of the Exchequer, has partly sought to fill that hole with measures to rein in tax avoidance and tax evasion, and by lowering the day-to-day costs of running government. Far more controversial are planned welfare cuts that have caused widespread unease within the governing left-of-center Labour Party. While a government-backed assessment found that the changes to disability benefits could push 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, into poverty, Reeves said that didn’t account for how the changes will move people into work and away from welfare. “That’s the best way to lift families out of poverty,” she said. Longer-term, the OBR forecasts were a bit more positive for the government with housing starts on course to meet a four-decade high following widespread planning reforms. Reeves was able to point to higher growth forecasts for the years ahead which, if they prove accurate, should ease the pressure on her to lower spending or increase taxes in the remaining years of this Parliament, which can run until the middle of 2029. However, the agency said the outlook looks “risky,” particularly on the international front. It highlighted risks posed by the prospect of a global trade war in light of the tariff policies being enacted by the Trump administration. Paul Johnson, director of the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, said another growth downgrade in the fall ahead of the annual budget is “entirely possible” and that Reeves has left herself at the “mercy of events” given her iron-clad adherence to her fiscal rules. “What the Chancellor has all but guaranteed is another six months of damaging speculation and uncertainty over tax policy,” he said. Reflecting geopolitical turbulence caused by the return of U.S. President Donald Trump, Reeves told lawmakers that a “more insecure world” requires a greater focus on national security. As a result, she confirmed a 2.2 billion-pound ($2.9 billion) increase in defense spending, which Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said is the biggest increase since the end of the Cold War. “This additional investment is not just about increasing our national security but increasing our economic security, too,” Reeves said. “As defense spending rises, I want the whole country to feel the benefits.” The British economy, the sixth-largest in the world, has underperformed its long-run average since the global financial crisis of 2008-9, and the new Labour government has made boosting growth its number one economic policy. Critics say Reeves is partly responsible for gloomy economic news since Labour returned to power in July after 14 years, because she was overly downbeat when taking on her role and has since increased taxes, particularly on businesses. “She is the architect of her own misfortune,” said Mel Stride, the economy spokesperson for the main opposition Conservative Party. Reeves received some welcome news Wednesday, with official figures showing that consumer price inflation fell to 2.8% from 3% the previous month. Though still above the Bank of England’s 2% target, Reeves will hope that easing price pressures will lead to further interest rate reductions that would lower the government’s debt interest payments.",UK government plugs hole in finances as 2025 growth forecast is halved to 1%,Pan Pylas,AP News,2025-03-26T08:20:44,2025-03-26T13:39:43,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.politico.eu/article/armenia-adopts-law-launch-european-union-accession-process/,"Armenia’s parliament has officially adopted a law on launching the country’s accession process to the European Union.  The legislation, which was initiated by a public petition to lawmakers and has now passed its second reading, calls on the Armenian government to begin the process of gaining membership of the EU. The South Caucasus country has been Russia’s close ally in the region for decades, but recently it has sought to cut ties with Moscow as Armenia accused it of failing to provide support in a conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan. While Yerevan is now working to reach a historic peace treaty with Azerbaijan, it is also keen to strengthen ties with Brussels.  However, the process of joining the EU can take decades, as it includes assessments of a country’s compliance with the bloc’s criteria in a wide range of policy areas, such as the functioning of democratic institutions, the judiciary and fundamental rights — and countries could even backtrack during the process. This is now the case with one of Armenia’s other neighbors, Georgia, which was accepted by the EU as a candidate in 2023, but  Brussels halted the accession process as the country began an authoritarian pivot.  The Kremlin’s influence remains strong in Armenia, as it is heavily dependent on Russian energy and trade, and Yerevan even hosts a Russian military base.",Armenian parliament adopts law to launch EU membership process,Csongor Körömi,POLITICO,2025-03-26T12:24:26,2025-03-26T12:25:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-refuse-give-up-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-donald-trump/,"KYIV	— The Kremlin is not planning to hand over control of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe to Ukraine or any other nation. “The station’s return to the Russian nuclear industry is a long-overdue fact that the international community can only recognize. The transfer of ZNPP itself or control over it to Ukraine or any other country is impossible,” the Russian foreign ministry wrote Tuesday night, referring to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, also ruling out any joint operation of the station. The ZNPP, located in Enerhodar — a city in the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region — was a crucial cog in Ukraine’s energy system, producing six gigawatts of power and covering 20 percent of the country’s electricity needs. However, the plant has not been operational since the Russian army occupied it from March 2022, violently dispersing local resistance. Last week,POLITICO reportedthat United States President Donald Trump sees control of the ZNPP as a crucial energy source for the proposed minerals mining deal with Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the ZNPP is Ukraine’s state property. Still, he was open to cooperation with the American side on its restoration if Ukraine takes back control over the plant and the city of Enerhodar. The White House said the U.S. is discussing ZNPP control with Russia. But the Kremlin claims the plant is now Russian after sham referendums it conducted illegally and at gunpoint in four Ukrainian regions in 2022. Putin made the ZNPP Russian property by special order and now considers the station Russian “under international law.” “An important aspect is that close cooperation on impressive sabotage potential of NATO countries with Ukraine makes impossible even temporary admission of representatives of these states to ZNPP,” the Russian foreign ministry said, hinting at its demand to strip Ukraine of Western intelligence aid in any peace negotiations.",Russia refuses to give up massive Ukrainian nuclear plant to Trump or anyone else,Veronika Melkozerova,POLITICO,2025-03-26T05:55:11,2025-03-26T05:56:03,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-crisis-stockpile-supplies-war-disease-natural-disaster-roxana-minzatu/,"BRUSSELS â
				― Every citizen should stockpile enough food to be self-sufficient for at least 72 hours in case of crisis, the European Commission is to warn, according to a draft of its Preparedness Union Strategy seen by POLITICO.
				
				“In case of extreme disruptions, the initial period is the most critical,” the document says, setting out possible scenarios, from war to cyber attacks and deadly disease to climate-driven floods.
				
				Five years since the first Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns and three since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and with natural disasters and financial shocks an ever-present risk, the plan lands as Europe lurches from one crisis to another. “None of the major crises of the past years were isolated or short-lived,” the document says. “Europe cannot afford to remain reactive.”
				
				Commission Executive Vice President Roxana Mînzatu is scheduled to present the strategy on Wednesday.
				Its
				message is “fix your roof while the sun is shining,” Mînzatu told POLITICO ahead of the publication, adding the Commission’s aim is “helping individuals … on a household level.”
				
				According to the 17-page draft, the strategy should “create a secure and resilient EU with the capabilities required to anticipate and manage threats and hazards, independently of their nature or origin.”
				
				That includes providing guidance to member countries to “cover the storage of essential supplies, crisis planning, shelter availability, measures to ensure availability of critical ground and space,”
				the proposal states.
				
				Just weeks after Europe
				published
				its first ever
				defense strategy, the preparedness plan says it’s “a matter of urgency” for the EU and its countries to strengthen preparedness, across all sectors.
				
Hostile actors
				
				And preparing for war is right up there. While not bringing any new defense initiatives, the strategy proposes a crisis management model drawing from Northern European countries where society as a whole — from citizens to businesses and governments — is involved. The Commission’s plan draws on the conclusions of the
				Niinistö report, which laid out proposals to improve the EU’s readiness for war and civil defense.
				
				The geopolitical conflict threat can come virtually as well as in the form of military offensives.
				
				Europe should be more prepared for cyber attacks, the draft states. Since the war in Ukraine began, Russia has been ramping up activity in cyberspace, including targeting critical infrastructure such as energy networks. Europe’s eastern flank in particular has experienced a surge of cyber attacks.
				
				China, Iran and North Korea also consistently target western governments, companies and other key institutions. State-sponsored hybrid and cyberattacks have become a “permanent feature of today’s reality,” the paper argues.
				
				One key proposal is to set up a “European cybersecurity alert system,” which the Commission says would improve European threat detection and situational awareness. It also proposes digital training and help for countries hoping to join the EU, and calls for more use of cyber diplomacy and better cooperation with NATO.

				Companies also have an active role to play in preparedness, as there’s a need to share information but also participate in “strategic foresight and anticipatory initiatives,” as well as training.
				
				“The EU needs to promote cooperation between public and private organisations in strategic sectors such as cybersecurity, ensuring the workforce needs and educational offer are aligned,” according to the draft.
				
Natural disasters
				
				Preparedness is “not just about potential man-made conflict,” Mînzatu said. “It is about how we react to floods; we have seen what has happened in Spain,” which suffered from 
				‘monster’ flooding last year, killing hundreds of people.
				
				Many people do not know what to do in the face of natural disasters, Mînzatu said. “All these types of crises require some set of basic skills, some understanding and knowledge about what to do first,” she said.
				
				The Commission proposes an EU-wide stockpiling strategy to strengthen access to critical resources including for emergency and disaster response, medical countermeasures, critical raw materials, energy equipment and possibly food and water. The strategy will combine centralized EU reserves with countries’ contributions, according to the report.
				
				It will also present a strategy to support medical countermeasures against public health threats — to be complemented by contingency stocks proposed in the
				Critical Medicines Act.
				
				And the Commission wants to strengthen its crisis response coordination, by creating a “crisis coordination hub,” building on the existing Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC). The hub will focus on anticipating and managing the consequences of crises across sectors, provide crisis-management support to the lead services and monitor the overall response to crises.
				
				While some EU countries want to focus investments on defense, others see climate-related issues as more important.
				Mînzatu argued these are two sides of the same coin.
				
				“You cannot have defense, you cannot have a green Europe without preparedness, and you cannot have preparedness by ignoring the green ambitions and the green targets of the [EU],” she said.
				
				Being better prepared is also going to require more flexible access to cash.
				
				The Commission proposes a review of the financial instruments for crisis response to ensure crisis financing mechanisms are scalable and can be adapted to evolving risks and crises. The executive also plans to embed preparedness in EU external investments, including through scaling up implementation of climate adaptation and resilience projects in partner countries.
				
				To solidify these measures, the Commission is mulling a new legislative package to set standards and measurable long-term preparedness targets.
				
				“The Commission will assess the need and feasibility of an EU Preparedness Law to strengthen the resilience of the vital societal functions by setting joint standards and measurable long-term targets,” the document reads.
				
				Preparedness and security will be “integrated and mainstreamed” in European legislation, policies and programs, according to the document, which lists 30 key actions under seven themes such as civil-military cooperation, public-private cooperation and population preparedness.
				
				An annex to the draft lists some 60 key actions to be implemented within the next two years, including stepping up monitoring of fake news, assessing the level of preparedness in financial services and working preparedness into school curriculums, all set for this year.

https://www.politico.eu/article/belgian-prosecutors-huawei-corruption-illegal-payments-letter/,"BRUSSELS — Belgian prosecutors are investigating whether Huawei made illegal payments to get an open letter written, signed by eight European parliamentarians, which defended the Chinese tech giant's interests, according to judicial documents seen by POLITICO. Belgian authorities this month raided 21 homes as part of a spiraling probe into “active corruption in the European Parliament” that “benefitted Huawei.” Investigators are looking into ""excessive gifts"" or “remuneration for taking political positions” that took place “from 2021 to the present day,” the prosecutors said. In a second major test of accountability for the European Parliament after the Qatargate scandal of 2022, four people have been charged with corruption and criminal organization and one with money laundering, the Belgian prosecutors' office said last week. According to an arrest warrant seen by POLITICO, first reported on by Italian daily La Repubblica, a key part of the investigation hinges on a letter sent by eight MEPs in February 2021 to three EU commissioners, in which they argue geopolitical tensions should not hinder the development of 5G equipment in Europe. That letter, although it does not mention Huawei by name, is seen as promoting the Chinese company's interests because it came as several EU governments were rolling out measures that sought to limit telecom operators’ use of Chinese equipment, arguing Beijing posed risks because of espionage, surveillance and potential economic dependency. Conservative Italian lawmaker Fulvio Martusciello, one of the signatories, posted the pro-Huawei letter on X on Feb. 15, 2021, but later deleted it. His former parliamentary adviser and his assistant have now both been arrested in relation to the Huawei probe, according to their lawyers. The assistant's contract has now been suspended. Cash for a letter The arrest warrant for Martusciello's assistant includes details from the Belgian prosecutors laying out the heart of the case, in which both she and his former adviser are alleged to have helped arrange payments for the letter, referred to as the ""5G"" letter in the judicial documents. The description of the Belgian probe, as provided by the investigative judge in charge of the case, says: ""A sum of €15,000 was offered to the writer of the 5G letter, while each co-signatory was offered €1,500."" “This transaction or proposed transaction is said to have been endorsed by HUAWEI's Chinese executives, in particular by .... [the] director of the Brussels office,” the document also reads. The director can only be identified as Abraham L. Moving on to bank details of what it describes as ""suspicious payments,"" the document sets out how the former adviser allegedly arranged for the payments via invoices ""in consideration of alleged consultancy services and campaign expenses, in the amounts of	 €18,450 and €27,500."" ""Assuming the facts are established, these amounts would represent the alleged compensation for the above-mentioned letter drafted by eight MEPs for the attention of three European Commissioners in favor of HUAWEI,"" the document continues. ""The investigation has brought to light the financial circuit of remunerations which would demonstrate the corruptive process."" As part of a series of bank transfers, the former adviser wired €6,700 to Martusciello, €1,000 to his assistant, and €14,800 to another parliamentary assistant, the warrant says. Several account holders	that received payments	remain unknown. When contacted by POLITICO, Belgian prosecutors declined to comment on an ongoing investigation. Martusciello did not respond to requests for comment about the bank transfers. Asked about Abraham L.'s alleged involvement in a bribery scheme, Huawei did not respond to a request for comment. A company spokesperson said in an earlier statement: “Huawei takes these allegations seriously and will urgently communicate with the investigation to further understand the situation. Huawei has a zero tolerance policy towards corruption or other wrongdoing, and we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations at all times.” Arrests and allegations Martusciello's current assistant was arrested in Italy last week as part of the Huawei probe. She ""was not involved in the political activities of Mr Martusciello, she only dealt with logistics,"" her lawyer Antimo Giaccio told POLITICO, adding she ""was very rarely at the European Parliament ... about 10 times."" Before an Italian judge on Tuesday, she rejected all the preliminary charges against her but said she stood ready to answer ""any questions from the Belgian authorities,"" her lawyer added. The former parliamentary adviser for Martusciello, who worked for him between 2015 and 2019, was also arrested in Paris last Thursday as part of the Huawei probe, his lawyer Benoît Martinez told POLITICO. “My client intends to fully cooperate with the Belgian authorities. He denies any involvement with the charges he’s suspected of,” he added. He declined to comment further on the charges related to his client. The Belgian secret services, which filed a declassified report that triggered the investigation, found digital evidence that the former adviser could have been involved in the drafting of the 2021 letter with one of Huawei's lobbyists, who can only be identified as Valerio O., the arrest warrant says. Valerio O.'s lawyer Denis Bosquet declined to comment. The investigators say the transfers can also ""be linked to the drafting by MEP Fulvio Martusciello of legislative amendments favorable to Huawei,"" and to a communication in which Valerio O. tells an employee of Huawei in Poland ""that they [Huawei] 'often cross the line and even pay for amendments.'"" The same month as promoting the letter, February 2021, Martusciello submitted amendments to a European parliamentary report that would favor Huawei's position in Europe. Martusciello did not reply to multiple requests for comment about the letter, but told POLITICO he didn’t know the charges against his assistant. He told Belgian newspaper Le Soir that he had never received anything from Huawei. “I've never been to China, I've never been to the stadium, I've never received a cell phone or any other gift,” he said. NGO Transparency International received an anonymous tip in connection to the 2021 letter and forwarded the tip to the EU's OLAF anti-fraud office, it said. The then-director of the civil rights group Michiel van Hulten this month posted on Bluesky that OLAF had dismissed the claims because of “insufficient suspicions” of wrongdoing. A spokesperson for OLAF confirmed it did not investigate the matter.	 Keeping a distance It remains unclear whether any of the co-signatories of the 2021 letter are being investigated by Belgian authorities as part of the Huawei corruption probe, but several of those current and former members of the European Parliament are now taking pains to distance themselves from it. POLITICO asked all of them about their involvement. Those who responded said they had not been contacted by authorities with regard to the letter. Italian conservative lawmaker Herbert Dorfmann insisted the text was Martusciello’s idea and said he would not have signed the letter had he known it was related to the Chinese firm. ""I have always been politically in favor of keeping Huawei out of the European market,"" he told POLITICO. He added neither he nor his team were offered money ""or any other form of compensation in exchange for [his] signature."" Former MEP Cristian-Silviu Bușoi, a Romanian conservative, stated he never consented to signing. “I looked through my official email and found no correspondence regarding this letter,” he said in a written statement. “I also do not recall giving verbal consent to Mr Martusciello, as is sometimes customary when colleagues seek support for their initiatives,” he also said, adding that neither he or his staff received any compensation nor were aware of any scheme related to the signature of the letter. Aldo Patriciello, a far-right Italian MEP, said in an email: ""I honestly struggle to remember whether the request for my signature came via email, phone call or WhatsApp."" He added that he had no direct or indirect relationship with Huawei or its lobbyists. Romanian conservative Daniel Buda, also a signatory, attributed his involvement to his team, stating he was informed through a briefing prepared by his office staff. “My support was solely driven by concerns about rural digital infrastructure, not influenced by external parties,” he said in an email. He added he had not been contacted by any investigative authority regarding the letter and that neither he or his team received any money in exchange for his signature. “I had no knowledge — neither then nor now — that behind this letter or activity there could be such a scheme,” he told POLITICO in a written statement. Former Italian social-democrat member Giuseppe Ferrandino said: “I am certain I never signed any letters of such kind"" and added he had never been contacted by any authorities regarding this topic.	""Nobody ever offered me money to influence my parliamentary activity,” he added. Other signatories included hard-right Italian lawmaker Giuseppe Milazzo and former Romanian social-democrat member Tudor Ciuhodaru, neither of whom responded to POLITICO’s requests for comment. Milazzo told Italian news agency ANSA that he had never had meetings related to the investigation into the Huawei case:	""I have never been offered and I have never accepted any money, gifts or any kind of favor, directly or indirectly, from [Huawei],"" he said. According to conversations with three former Huawei officials, the 2021 letter posted by Martusciello was meant to counter another open letter from October 2020 in which over 40 lawmakers urged the European Commission to impose stricter controls over the use of Chinese equipment in Europe.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250326001000315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, March 26 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Wednesday denounced Japan's launch of a new military command aimed at better integrating its self-defense force units, claiming Tokyo is in the final stage of preparing to become a ""war state."" Japan on Monday launched the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) Joint Operation Command, a new command designed to oversee joint operations of its ground, maritime and air defense forces, in a bid to better respond to emergency situations and smoothly coordinate with U.S. troops in Japan. North Korea said Japan established the command for the ""practical"" use of long-range missiles as it has focused on preparations to become a war state for overseas aggression over the past 80 years since its defeat in World War II. ""Such a preparation has entered the final stage,"" the Korean Central News Agency said in a commentary. Citing Japan-led joint military drills with 11 nations last year and a trilateral naval exercise among South Korea, the United States and Japan in March, North Korea claimed Japan is gearing up to reach the front lines to realize its wartime militarism. North Korea has shown a sensitive reaction to Japan's military buildup. Last week, Pyongyang condemned Japan's move to consider long-range missiles on its southwestern island of Kyushu, warning the move would make it a ""common target"" for its neighboring countries. sooyeon@yna.co.kr(END)",N.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/us-has-given-syria-a-list-of-demands-for-sanction-relief-sources-say/,"WASHINGTON — The United States has handed Syria a list of conditions that it wants Damascus to fulfill in exchange for partial sanctions relief, six people familiar with the matter tell Reuters, including ensuring foreigners are not in senior governing roles. US Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Levant and Syria Natasha Franceschi gave the list of demands to Syrian foreign minister Asaad al-Shibani at an in-person meeting on the sidelines of a Syria donor conference in Brussels on March 18, according to two of the people — a US official and a Syrian source familiar with the matter. Reuters is first to report both the list and the in-person meeting, the first high-level direct contact between Damascus and Washington since US President Donald Trump took office on January 20, has been previously reported. Reuters spoke to six sources for this story, including two US officials, a Syrian source, a regional diplomat, and two sources in Washington familiar with the matter. They all requested anonymity to discuss the high-level diplomacy. Among the conditions placed by the United States are Syria’s destruction of any remaining chemical weapons stores and cooperation on counter-terrorism, the two US officials, the Syrian source, and both sources in Washington say. Another demand was making sure foreign fighters are not installed in senior roles in Syria’s governing structure, the US officials and one of the sources in Washington say. Syria has already appointed some foreign ex-rebels, including Uyghurs, a Jordanian, and a Turk, to its defense ministry — a move that alarmed foreign governments. Washington also asked Syria to appoint a liaison to assist US efforts to find Austin Tice, the US journalist who went missing in Syria over a decade ago, according to two US officials and both sources in Washington. In return for fulfilling all the demands, Washington would provide some sanctions relief, all six sources say. One specific action would be a two-year extension of an existing exemption for transactions with Syrian governing institutions and possibly the issuance of another exemption. The US would also issue a statement supporting Syria’s territorial integrity, the source says. Washington did not provide a specific timeline for the conditions to be fulfilled. Syria’s foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comments. A spokesperson for the State Department says the agency does not “discuss our private diplomatic conversations publicly.” Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce last week said Washington was monitoring the actions of the interim rulers.","US has given Syria a list of demands for sanction relief, sources say",Reuters,The Times of Israel,2025-03-25T17:25:33,2025-03-25T17:25:33,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250325-ukraine-russia-usa-putin-zelensky-trump-negotiations-us-proposal-ceasefire-black-sea-truce-riyadh,"The United States said on Tuesday it has reached separate agreements with Ukraine and Russia to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea and to implement a ban on attacks by the two countries on each other's energy facilities. The agreements, if implemented, would represent the clearest progress yet towards a wider ceasefire that Washington sees a stepping stone towards peace talks to bring an end to Russia's three-year-old war in Ukraine. The Kremlin confirmed Tuesday that Moscow had agreed to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea. Russia and the United States have also agreed to develop measures to halt strikes on Russian and Ukrainian energy facilities for a period of 30 days that began on March 18, it added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the truce was effective immediately on Tuesday and that he would seek more weapons and sanctions on Russia from US President	Donald Trump if Moscow broke the deals. ""If the Russians violate this, then I have a direct question for President Trump. If they violate, here is the evidence	– we ask for sanctions, we ask for weapons, etc,"" Zelensky told reporters at a news conference in Kyiv. The US agreement with Russia goes further than the agreement with Ukraine, with Washington committing to help seek the lifting of international sanctions on Russian agriculture and fertiliser exports, long a Russian demand. The Kremlin said the Black Sea agreements would not come into effect unless links between some Russian banks and the international financial system were restored. Zelensky said this was untrue, and that the deals did not require sanctions relief to come into force. Speaking in his nightly address to Ukrainians, he accused Moscow of trying to ""distort"" the agreements and ""deceive"" the world. Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv had agreed to both a maritime ceasefire and a pause by Russia and Ukraine in attacks on each other's energy infrastructure. But he said Kyiv would regard any movement of Russian military vessels outside the eastern part of the Black Sea as a violation and a threat. In this case Ukraine would have the full right to exercise self-defence, he said. Seeking to fulfil a pledge by Trump to end the war quickly, the US originally proposed a full 30-day ceasefire	– to which Ukraine agreed in principle on March 11	– as a step towards peace talks. But the Americans held separate talks in Saudi Arabia with Russia and Ukraine this week to discuss more limited ceasefires on energy and at sea, after Putin responded to the wider truce plan with a long list of conditions and questions. Trump is pressing both sides to bring a swift end to the war, something he promised to achieve when he ran for president last year. At the same time he is pursuing a rapid rapprochement with Moscow that both sides say could lead to lucrative business opportunities and cooperation across a wide range of areas, from minerals to sport and space exploration. Ukraine and its European allies fear Trump could strike a hasty deal with Putin that undermines their security and caves in to Russian demands, including for Kyiv to abandon its NATO ambitions and give up the entirety of four regions claimed by Russia as its own. Ukraine has rejected that as tantamount to surrender.

Israel would then reoccupy the Strip, marking the first time it has had full control over the area since Israel pulled out of it in 2005. The report emphasized that Israel's security cabinet has not yet approved the plan and that it claimed to have been formulated by IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir with backing from the ""far-right."" Two officials said that the new plans were made possible by US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, the report noted.

According to coastguard spokesman Liu Dejun, the Chinese ships took “necessary control measures” and issued warnings to drive the Japanese boats away between March 21 and 24 after they entered what China considers to be its territorial waters. He did not elaborate on the specific actions taken against the Japanese vessels which were identified as the Rieimaru, Daihachikin Kai Maru, Daihachitaisei Maru and Senkoumaru No 2. “Diaoyu Islands and their affiliated islets are China’s inherent territory,” Liu said in a brief statement late on Monday. “We urge the Japanese side to immediately cease all illegal activities in these waters.” Liu added that the coastguard would continue to conduct rights protection and law enforcement patrols around the islands – known in Japan as the Senkakus – to safeguard China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights. The Diaoyus, which comprise five uninhabited islets and three reefs, are located 169km (105 miles) east of Taiwan and 409km west of Okinawa. The surrounding waters are believed to contain valuable resources, including fish, oil and natural gas. Earlier on Monday, Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest over the presence of China’s coastguard ships near the contested islets. Japanese officials had previously accused China of making “unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force”.",China coastguard drives off Japanese fishing boats in escalating island dispute,Enoch Wong,South China Morning Post,2025-03-25T03:00:07,2025-03-25T03:50:22,gemini-2.0-flash

Han said he will make every effort to navigate the ""tariff storm"" initiated by the U.S. by tapping into his past experience in trade and foreign policy, and actively work with both the ruling and opposition parties to provide relief to the crisis in people's livelihoods. He called on Cabinet members to continue to pursue government policies in a timely manner while communicating them to the public. On the wildfires that have been ravaging the nation's southeast since last Friday, Han vowed the government's unsparing support for quick damage recovery and every effort to swiftly put out the blazes with helicopters and on-ground personnel. On the end-of-month deadline for protesting medical school students to return to their classrooms, Han said his ""heart is heavy"" that many have yet to return a year after the government announced an admissions hike to address a shortage of doctors. ""Medical school students are talented people who will protect the lives of both the current and future generations of the Republic of Korea,"" he said, referring to South Korea by its formal name. ""These people must now return to their places."" Han also called on the military to maintain a watertight readiness posture to be able to respond firmly to any provocation from North Korea amid the grave security situation surrounding the nation. At a separate meeting of trade-related ministers later in the day, the acting president said he will replace the so-called external economic affairs meeting led by the deputy prime minister for economic affairs with an ""economic and security strategy task force"" led by himself to better respond to growing uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariff policies and other issues. Han specially called for thorough monitoring and responses ahead of the planned announcement of new U.S. tariffs on April 2. hague@yna.co.kr (END)","(LEAD) Acting president calls for protecting people's safety, national interest amid trade war",Lee Haye-ah,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-25T13:49:32,2025-03-25T13:49:32,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-eu-defense-pact-really-does-depend-on-fish-european-minister-warns/,"BRUSSELS — A defense and security pact being drawn up between the U.K. and the EU will fall apart if Keir Starmer doesn't make concessions on fishing rights, according to a senior European politician. 
Jessica Rosencrantz, Sweden’s EU affairs minister, said it was vital to make fast progress on a formal security agreement with the U.K., especially at a time of heightened tension over Ukraine, as countries rapidly re-arm. Officials on both sides are looking to a summit in May as a moment when such a deal could be signed, at least in outline terms. 
But in an interview with POLITICO, the minister said EU member governments were unlikely to sign off on a security deal with the U.K. unless negotiations are also resolved on other “sensitive” issues, including access to British waters for European fishing fleets. A deal on fish would also help in “building trust” between London and Brussels, she added. 
“Just to be clear, I think it’s really important that the EU and U.K. work together on defense and security,” Rosencrantz said. “Obviously, there are other sensitive issues as well for many member states which also need to be resolved, fisheries being one.” 
Asked if it would be possible to complete a defense pact first and then move onto negotiating fishing rights, she said: “I think we have to find a way where we can do both because we want to move ahead with the defense partnership but for many countries it’s important to solve the other sensitive issues as well. And therefore I think it will be important to take steps also when it comes to fisheries and other topics.” 
While behind the scenes officials have let it be known that France in particular is determined to secure more advantageous fishing rights in return for a reset in the U.K.-EU relationship, it is rare for such a senior figure in a European government to publicly make the link between the defense pact and fish. 
Reset in relations
The issue of fishing rights dogged the negotiations over Britain's departure from the EU and soured relations between London and Paris after the U.K. left the bloc, especially during Boris Johnson’s tenure as U.K. prime minister, when he clashed repeatedly with French President Emmanuel Macron. 
British officials had hoped that Starmer’s plan for a “reset” in relations with the EU would get a quick win on security and defense, because the U.K.'s military is still held in high regard across Europe ― and it also has nuclear weapons ― making an alliance attractive. 
But numerous officials involved in the process say progress has slowed as a result of the question of fishing rights, along with issues such as a proposed youth mobility scheme and border policies for Gibraltar. Negotiations are ongoing with the aim of having an agreed plan ready to show off at a summit in the U.K. between Starmer and the EU's top brass on May 19. 
U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to downgrade American commitments on European security — and the EU’s plans to boost its homegrown defense industry in response — have added a layer of complexity to the talks on a British deal. 
Brussels has proposed a  €150 billion loan program for EU governments to spend on re-arming. The funds should be invested on a “buy more European” basis, according to Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president. 
But without a formal defense agreement with Brussels, the U.K. will be locked out of the scheme. If a deal is agreed, European governments will be free to use the funding to buy British-made weapons and equipment.
“We want the U.K. to be a part of this as well,” said Rosencrantz, the Swedish minister. “We have a joint interest, responsibility, we agree on the matter of supporting Ukraine, on ramping up on defense. We need to work together and it would be very, very good to have a partnership.”

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-chief-heads-to-meet-lutnick-greer-to-defuse-steel-aluminum-spat/,"BRUSSELS — European Union trade chief Maroš Šefčovič will meet with his U.S. counterparts Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer in Washington D.C. on Tuesday, in the EU’s latest effort to dampen soaring trade tensions with the United States. In a sign of the political sensitivity of the trip, Björn Seibert, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s top aide, will travel with Šefčovič. “We should be making every effort on both sides to avoid harmful tariffs and build — rather than tear down — the EU-U.S. trade and economic relationship, which is the strongest in the world,” Olof Gill, a Commission trade spokesperson, said on Monday. The visit comes as the EU weighs imposing retaliatory tariffs on €21.5 billion in U.S. exports to “mirror” the new, and broader, steel and aluminum duties imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month. Late last week, the Commission decided to delay one batch of its tariff response from April 1 to April 13. That bought time to negotiate with Washington and calibrate the EU’s response as Washington finalizes a fresh round of “reciprocal” tariffs due on April 2 — styled by Trump as “Liberation Day.” The U.S. president indicated last week that he was not open to granting exemptions from those tariffs — with the EU set to be caught among the worst hit. Brussels is also trying to rally some skeptical EU countries, such as France and Italy, which have lashed out against the inclusion of wine and alcohol in the lists of goods likely to be caught in the trade spat. It’s Šefčovič’s second trip to Washington since Trump took office in January. He will meet Lutnick, the Commerce secretary, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Tuesday. It wasn’t yet clear whether the EU trade negotiator would attend any other public engagements in Washington D.C.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-24-2025-c0293b1b22dcd9178bf678763e01290e,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The United Nations said Monday it will “reduce its footprint” in the Gaza Strip after an Israeli tank strike hit one of its compounds last week, killing one staffer from Bulgaria and wounding five other employees. The world body will temporarily remove about a third of its approximately 100 international staffers working in Gaza, U.N. Secretary-General spokesman Stéphane Dujarric. He pointed to the increased danger after Israel relaunched its military campaign last week with bombardment that has since killed hundreds of Palestinians. Israel has also cut off all food, medicine, aid and other supplies to Gaza’s population for the past three weeks. Dujarric’s statement was the U.N’s first to point the finger at Israel in the March 19 explosion at the U.N. guesthouse in central Gaza. He said that “based on the information currently available,” the strikes on the site “were caused by an Israeli tank.” The Israeli military repeated its denial that it was responsible for the strike, which took place a day after Israel shattered Gaza’s 2-month-old ceasefire with a surprise bombardment across the Gaza Strip.  Dujarric said the U.N. “has made taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organization’s footprint in Gaza, even as humanitarian needs soar.” He said the U.N. “is not leaving Gaza,” pointing out that it still has about 13,000 national staff in Gaza, mainly working for UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.  New Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours killed more than 60 Palestinians around Gaza, the territory’s Health Ministry said. The ministry’s count does not distinguish between civilians and militants.  The ministry on Monday put out a list of the names of more than 15,000 children, 17 and under, killed by Israel’s campaign since it began more than 17 months ago. The list included nearly 5,000 children under the age of 6 who had been killed, including 876 infants who had not reached a year in age, Israel, which launched its campaign .in retaliation for Hamas’ October 2023 attack, says it has restarted its bombardment and cut off food to Gaza to force Hamas to accept new terms for the ceasefire and release more hostages. It says it targets Hamas members and positions, blaming the group for civilian deaths because it operates among the population. Air raid sirens and explosions were heard over Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and central Israel on Monday evening as the military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency rescue service said “teams are en-route to search areas where reports of rocket strikes have been received.” Yemen’s Houthi rebels have fired a handful of long-range missiles at Israel in the days since it resumed the war in Gaza. There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the Houthis.  Two rockets from the Gaza Strip were also intercepted after crossing into Israeli territory earlier Monday evening, setting off sirens, the Israeli military said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Al-Quds Brigades, the military arm of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, claimed responsibility. The U.N. reduction comes as aid workers and medical staff have come under fire.  The International Committee of the Red Cross said its office in the southern city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip was damaged by an explosive projectile Monday. It said no staff were hurt but the damage has a direct impact on its ability to operate. It did not specify who was behind the explosion. ICRC also said that on Sunday, contact was lost with emergency medical technicians from the Palestine Red Crescent Society and their whereabouts remain unknown. Last week, humanitarian workers in Gaza were killed and injured, it said. On Sunday, Israel struck the surgery ward at southern Gaza’s biggest hospital, killing two people and wounding others, many of whom were already injured by earlier strikes. One of those killed at Khan Younis’ Nasser Hospital was a teenage boy recovering from surgery.  The other was a Hamas official that Israel says was the target of the strike, Ismail Barhoum. Hamas said Barhoum was undergoing treatment at the time. The Israeli military denied that, saying he oversaw Hamas’ finances in Gaza, including transferring money to its armed wing, and was working out of the hospital. The strike last week on the U.N. compound outside Deir al-Balah killed a 51-year-old staffer, Marin Valev Marinov. He worked with the U.N. Office for Project Services, which carries out infrastructure and development projects around the world. In the two days before the deadly blast, strikes hit next to and then directly in the compound, UNOPS chief Jorge Moreira da Silva said earlier. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike and confirmed that the military was aware of the facility’s location.  Olga Cherevko, spokesperson for the U.N.’s humanitarian office, known as OCHA, said the U.N. and its partners have already suspended a number of activities, many in education, protection and water and sanitation services. The reason, she was, was safety concerns and the impact of Israeli evacuation orders. “A lot things are constrained right now because of the security situation,” she told AP before Dujarric’s announcement. “The challenges are massive. We have had a lot of our activities affected by the situation and a lot of our partners have had to suspend operations because it is just not safe.” Movement of trucks, including those distributing water, have been affected, she said. Only 29 out of 237 temporary learning spaces have resumed their activities since the ceasefire collapse, she said. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 113,000, according to the Health Ministry. Nearly 90% of the population of some 2,3 million have been driven from their homes. Israel launched the campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 others. ___ Lederer reported from the United Nations, Keath from Cairo.

https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seeks-full-control-of-occupied-ukrainian-regions-in-talks-with-us-media-reports/,"Russia is pushing to gain full control over four occupied Ukrainian oblasts—Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson—during negotiations with the United States in Saudi Arabia, the Moscow Times reported, citing sources familiar with the Kremlin’s strategy. Although Russian forces do not fully control any of these regions, the Kremlin demands them in their administrative borders, as defined in the Russian Constitution following their illegal annexation. A Kremlin-linked official told the Moscow Times that Russia's President Vladimir Putin cannot afford to lose these territories politically, and Russia intends to solidify its grip on them at any cost. ""The Constitution has no mechanism for regions to leave Russia. We need all of Zaporizhzhia and all of Kherson,"" the official reportedly said. The Kyiv Independent can't immediately verify these claims. Another Russian government source suggested that Moscow hopes Washington might pressure Kyiv to withdraw entirely from the occupied regions. ""Either Trump convinces them to leave, or we are told to enter prolonged negotiations while simultaneously using military force to secure control. That would be the worst scenario for us since river crossings are always costly operations,"" the source added. As an alternative, Russia may attempt to seize additional Ukrainian territory, such as parts of Dnipropetrovsk or Sumy oblasts, and then offer an exchange for Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, another Russian official speculated. ""We hope to find a way that avoids storming Kherson or forcing a crossing of the Dnipro River. That would mean thousands of casualties for us,"" he admitted. As of late 2024, Russian forces controlled about 98.5% of Luhansk Oblast and 60% of the Donetsk region. Despite these challenges, Russian diplomats believe that a potential Trump administration may be indifferent to the exact borders of a future settlement. ""From what I understand, Trump wants a modern, well-armed, pro-Western Ukraine,"" a Russian diplomat told the outlet. ""He cannot just hand over Ukraine entirely. But where exactly the border is drawn—that may not matter much to him.""","Russia seeks full control of partially occupied Ukrainian regions in talks with US, media reports",Olena Goncharova,The Kyiv Independent,2025-03-24T18:17:00,2025-03-25T03:19:28,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vzp3e62d4o,"Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed opposition parties for provoking a ""movement of violence"" as protests in the country continued for a sixth night. Unrest began in Istanbul last Wednesday when the city's Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu - Erdogan's main political rival - was detained on corruption charges. Imamoglu said the allegations against him were politically motivated, a claim Erdogan has denied. Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party's (CHP), which announced Imamoglu as its presidential candidate on Sunday, said the demonstrations will end on Tuesday, without saying what the next steps would be. Erdogan has labelled the demonstrations ""evil"" and blamed the opposition for ""disturbing the peace of our citizens with provocations"". Speaking from Ankara, Turkey's capital, Erdogan called for the protests to end and said that ""instead of responding to allegations"", opposition parties had ""made the most vile and unlawful statements in our political history for [the past] five days"". On Monday, vehicles carrying water cannons were seen close to the city hall, though protests appeared to be largely peaceful with no repeat of thefierce clashesseen on Sunday. Lydia, one of the demonstrators, told AFP that the Turkish authorities were ""hunting us like pests"", adding: ""They sprayed pepper spray on us like insecticides."" Young people - many of whom may not know any other government than this one under Erdogan - have played an important role in the protests. They have differing political views and do not appear to be affiliated with a particular political movement at the protests. They are rallying against the government, but they do not hesitate to criticise the opposition as well. Asked if she is afraid of the potential repercussions of demonstrating, one woman told the BBC: ""There is nothing left to lose."" Another, a 25-year-old woman who attended Sunday's protest, said she was afraid before - ""but now I'm just angry"". In figures released before Monday evening's gatherings, the Turkish government said 1,133 people had been arrested since the protests began. With the CHP apparently ending its rallies in Istanbul, it is unclear if other spontaneous protests will continue. CHP leader Ozgur Ozel spoke to the thousands gathered on Monday night, telling the crowd that the demonstration was ""an act of defiance against fascism"". Ozel said he would visit Imamoglu in jail in Silivri on Tuesday. He added that the CHP would appeal for him to be released pending trial, and for his trial to be shown live on state broadcaster TRT. Imamoglu was confirmed as the CHP's candidate for Turkey's 2028 presidential election on Monday, despite being in custody. The selection vote was symbolic as he had been the only person running. He had spent the previous night in jail after being formally arrested and charged with ""establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender"". He was also suspended from his post as mayor. Prosecutors had also accused him of ""aiding an armed terrorist organisation"", but this was not included in the charges. Before he was detained, Istanbul University said it was revoking Imamoglu's degree. If upheld, it would throw his presidential run into question, as the Turkish constitution requires presidents to have completed higher education. In a post on X over the weekend, Imamoglu said he would ""never bow"" and criticised his arrest as a ""black stain on our democracy"". His wife, Dilek Kaya Imamoglu, told demonstrators outside Istanbul's city hall that the ""injustice"" her husband faced had ""struck a chord with every conscience"". Much of the protesters' anger is directed at Erdogan and his government. ""I don't know what he did 20 years ago, but nowadays, he is just a dictator,"" Irmak, a 22-year-old university student, told the BBC World Service at a demonstration in the Sarachane area of Istanbul. Irmak and her friends, Ozge and Elif, said they had activated the location sharing feature on their phones, as they fear being detained by police. These demonstrations have been the largest in Turkey since the Gezi protests of 2013, which began in Istanbul over the demolition of a local park. They have been largely peaceful, but on Sunday police officers fired water cannons and used pepper spray as clashes unfolded. ""We are the fruits of the trees of the Gezis,"" Irmak said. ""We are here to protect democracy. It's not just about Ekrem Imamoglu - it's about Turkey's democracy."" Imamoglu was one of more than 100 people detained last week as part of an investigation. Others arrested included politicians, journalists and businessmen. ""We are not accepting this injustice,"" Mustafa, among the protesters, told the BBC. ""We want democracy and we want our friends back because Imomoglu is not the only one behind the bars right now."" He added: ""We want to re-establish democracy in this country and we want to save the republic from this authoritarian populist regime. And for the short term, we just want our mayor back, we want our friends back."" Imamoglu's arrest does not prevent his candidacy or election as president, but he will not be able to run if he is convicted of any of the charges against him. The opposition mayor is seen as one of the most formidable rivals of Erdogan, who has held office in Turkey for 22 years as both prime minister and president. Erdogan's term in office is due to expire in 2028, and under the current rules, he cannot stand again â	but he could call an early election or try to change the constitution to allow him to remain in power for longer. Turkey's Ministry of Justice has criticised those connecting Erdogan to the arrests, and insisted on its judicial independence. Additional reporting by Isabella Bull The mayor of Istanbul has been imprisoned on corruption and terrorism charges, prompting mass protests. The British rock band scraps a concert after the promoter insulted anti-government protesters. Demonstrators called for democracy to be defended after the arrest of opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu.

https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/greenland-trump-00246587,"Greenland did not invite an American delegation to come visit this week, the self-ruling island’s government said Monday, flatly denying a claim made by President Donald Trump. Usha Vance, the wife of Vice President JD Vance, will land in the Danish territory on Thursday, alongside National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. The planned visit has been met with anger in Greenland, with outgoing Prime Minister Múte B. Egede calling it part of the U.S.’ “very aggressive” bid to seize the Arctic island. “We are now at a level where this cannot in any way be characterized as a harmless visit from a politician’s wife. … The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,” he said. Trump told reporters Monday that Greenlandic “officials” requested Washington send a team to the island. “People from Greenland are asking us to go there,” he said. But Greenland’s government said that was false. “Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,” the government said in a post on Facebook. Pipaluk Lynge, a senior Greenlandic member of parliament who chairs the island’s foreign and security policy committee, told POLITICO that Trump’s claims that Greenland had invited the delegation were “not true.” She added that a protest was planned for Vance’s arrival in the town of Sisimiut, following two other demonstrations in recent weeks against Trump’s stated desire to take control of Greenland. “We are protesting politically [as] the people of Greenland,” she said. Trump floated the prospect of the U.S. acquiring Greenland in his first term but has raised the stakes since reentering the White House, calling it an “absolute necessity” and refusing to rule out taking the world’s largest island using military force or economic coercion. In January, the then-president-elect sent his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to visit the island to build support for a U.S. takeover in a trip that was panned by local lawmakers as a “staged” political stunt. Trump’s overtures have been met with fierce resistance in both Greenland — where all elected parties have rejected his annexation threats and polls show the vast majority of people oppose joining the U.S., instead favoring independence — as well as Denmark, which retains some authority over the island’s affairs. With its strategic spot in the Arctic and vast, largely untapped caches of mineral resources, including rare earths, Greenland occupies an increasingly important position in global politics. © 2025 POLITICO LLC","Greenland to Trump: No, we didn't invite you",Seb Starcevic,Politico,2025-03-24T19:14:15,2025-03-24T19:14:15,gemini-2.0-flash

The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) issued the message in a commentary, referring to the trilateral joint maritime drills conducted in international waters off South Korea's southern resort island of Jeju from Monday through Thursday last week. The naval drills -- the first of their kind this year and since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office in January -- involved the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and aimed to enhance deterrence against North Korea's military threats. The KCNA accused the trilateral drills of ""escalating the already tense regional political and military situation to the extremes,"" noting they were conducted alongside the joint annual South Korea-U.S. exercise, ""Freedom Shield."" ""The U.S.' adventuristic frenzy to dominate the entire Asia-Pacific, along with hostile forces, is completely exceeding all precedents,"" the KCNA said.

In less than a week of air and ground operations since Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas, its forces have killed hundreds of people in Gaza — sending the death toll from 17 months of war soaring above 50,000. Meanwhile, officials say Egypt has introduced a new proposal to try and get the ceasefire back on track. Hamas would release five living hostages, including an American-Israeli, in return for Israel allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza and a weekslong pause in the fighting, an Egyptian official said Monday. Israel would also release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. A Hamas official said the group had “responded positively” to the proposal, without elaborating. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the closed-door talks. Israel says it fired on a Red Cross office in Gaza by mistake. The Israeli military says its troops shot at the building after identifying a threat from Palestinian militants. “It was later determined that the identification was false,” the military said, adding that the soldiers didn’t realize the building was being used by the Red Cross. “The incident will be reviewed,” the brief statement said. The Red Cross says the building was damaged but no staff members were hurt. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says an Israeli drone strike in south Lebanon has killed one person. State-run News Agency quoted a Health Ministry statement as saying that the Monday night drone strike took place in the village of Qaaqaaiyet el-Jisr. It was not immediately clear who the target was. Israel has killed several Hezbollah members over the past weeks in drones strike on south Lebanon Israeli settlers beat up one of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning film “No Other Land ” in the occupied West Bank on Monday, and he was then detained by the Israeli military, activists on the scene said. Dozens of settlers attacked the Palestinian village of Susiya in the Masafer Yatta area, destroying property, said the activist group Center for Jewish Nonviolence. They attacked Hamdan Ballal, one of the documentary’s co-directors, leaving his head bleeding, the activists said. As he was being treated in an ambulance, soldiers detained him and a second Palestinian man, the group said. It said his whereabouts were now unknown. The Israeli military said it was looking into the episode but did not immediately comment. “No Other Land,” which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents of Masafer Yatta to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. It has two Palestinian co-directors, Ballal and Basel Adra, both residents of Masafar Yatta, and two Israeli directors, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor. Air raid sirens and explosions were heard over Jerusalem on Monday evening after the Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. Yemen’s Houthi rebels have fired a handful of long-range missiles at Israel in the days since Israeli forces resumed the war in Gaza. There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the Houthis. The Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, in a letter to the U.N. Security Council, referred to “baseless accusations” and threats by senior U.S. administration officials and President Donald Trump against Iran while trying to justify what he said were unlawful attacks against Yemen. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani warned that “any act of aggression will have severe consequences, for which the United States will bear full responsibility.” He said Iran will “resolutely defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity and national interests under international law against any hostile action.” The U.S. has launched a series of airstrikes against strongholds of Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who have disrupted international maritime trade by targeting ships in the Red Sea. He urged the Security Council to speak out against the U.S. “blatant provocations.” But since the U.S. has veto power in the council, there is no chance of that happening. Two rockets were intercepted after crossing into Israeli territory next to the Gaza Strip, setting off air raid sirens on Monday evening, the Israeli military said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Al-Quds Brigades, the military arm of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, claimed responsibility for firing a barrage of rockets toward the area of southern Israel bordering Gaza. Militants in Gaza have fired a handful of rockets at Israel in the days since it broke the ceasefire, which have been intercepted or fell in open areas. Islamic Jihad is the smaller of Gaza’s two main Palestinian militant groups. An Israeli strike killed at least five people including two women in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, the Health Ministry’s emergency service said. The strike Monday afternoon hit a house in the Qisan al-Najjar area, south of Khan Younis, it said. The United Nations said Monday it will “reduce its footprint” in the Gaza Strip after an Israeli tank strike hit one of its compounds, killing one staffer and wounding five others last week. Israel has denied it was behind the March 19 explosion at the U.N. guesthouse in central Gaza. In a statement Monday, U.N. Secretary-General spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said that “based on the information currently available,” the strikes on the site “were caused by an Israeli tank.” The Israeli military did not immediately comment. Dujarric also said the U.N. would be cutting back about a third of its approximately 100 international staffers in Gaza. He said the U.N. “is not leaving Gaza,” pointing out that it still has about 13,000 national staff in Gaza, mainly working for UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. The U.N. “has made taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organization’s footprint in Gaza, even as humanitarian needs soar,” he said. The move comes as Israel has cut off all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza’s around 2 million people for more than three weeks. “Violence feeds more violence,” European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday at a briefing in Jerusalem, where she met with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, less than a week after Israel broke the ceasefire in Gaza. “What we are witnessing now is a dangerous escalation. It is causing unbearable uncertainty for the hostages and their families and is likewise causing horror and death for the Palestinian people,” she added. Saar said the “war can end tomorrow with releasing our hostages, the demilitarization of Gaza and the withdrawal of the armed Hamas and Islamic Jihad forces.” The building was hit “by an explosive projectile despite being clearly marked and notified to all parties,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement decrying the attack Monday. No staff members were hurt, but damage to the office in Rafah “has a direct impact on the ICRC’s ability to operate” at a time when the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah is treating casualties from the war, the statement said. The ICRC statement did not say who might’ve been responsible for attacking their office. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strike. Israeli forces have been advancing into Rafah in recent days. Qatar’s Al Jazeera satellite news network says one of its Palestinian freelance reporters, Hossam Shabat, was killed by an Israeli airstrike on his car in northern Gaza. AP correspondent Naeun Kim reports on Israel’s deadly renewed assault in Gaza, including the bombing of a hospital. Shabat was killed Monday while covering the war for the broadcaster’s Arabic-language TV channel, the network said. He had been wounded by an Israeli strike last November, the network reported at the time. Another Palestinian journalist was killed in a separate Israeli airstrike earlier Monday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital. Mohammed Mansour was a correspondent for the news website Palestine Today. Al Jazeera is one of the few international media outlets to remain in Gaza throughout the war. The channel is owned by Qatar, which alongside Egypt and the U.S. has been a key negotiator for the ceasefire. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike that killed Shabat. Israel has accused other Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants. The channel denies the accusations and says Israel is trying to silence journalists covering the war. An Israeli anti-settlement group says there has been an “unprecedented surge” in approvals for new settler homes in the occupied West Bank since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office. During his first term, Trump strongly backed Israel’s claims to territories seized in war, at times upending decades of American foreign policy. Previous administrations have admonished Israel over settlement expansion while taking little action to curb it. The Peace Now group, which closely tracks settlement growth, said Monday that plans for 10,503 housing units in the West Bank have been advanced since the start of the year, compared to just 9,971 in all of 2024. It says another 1,344 homes are set to be approved on Wednesday. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution. Israel has built well over 100 settlements that are now home to over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The Israeli military says a senior Hamas leader killed in a strike on a hospital in the Gaza Strip was in charge of the group’s finances. Ismail Barhoum was killed in an Israeli strike late Sunday on Nasser Hospital, where Hamas said he was receiving treatment. The strike also killed a teenage boy recovering from surgery. The military said Monday that Barhoum oversaw Hamas’ finances in Gaza and transferred funds to its military wing. It said he was also serving as the head of Hamas’ government in Gaza after replacing another senior official killed in a strike last week. Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani denied that Barhoum was receiving medical treatment in the hospital, saying he had been there for weeks meeting with other senior militants. Israel has killed most of Hamas’ top leaders and scores of mid-level commanders during the 17-month war. The group was still able to quickly reassert control over the territory during a ceasefire that took hold in January. The Gaza Health Ministry said Monday the bodies of 61 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 143 wounded, it said in its daily report. The overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war rose to at least 50,082, the ministry said. Another 113,408 have been wounded, it said. Its figures do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The Palestinian Civil Defense agency says it has lost contact with six of its members who went on a rescue mission in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The emergency workers group said its members along with others from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society went to Rafah on Sunday morning after receiving calls that Israeli troops entered the area of Hashasheen in western Rafah. It added in a statement Monday that since then, there has been no word from the paramedics. The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that on Sunday, contact was lost with emergency medical technicians from its sister organization, the Palestine Red Crescent Society, and their whereabouts remain unknown. Palestinian medics say an Israeli strike hit a school where displaced people were sheltering in the Gaza Strip, killing at least four people, including a child. Another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s strike in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Three other hospitals had earlier reported 25 deaths from Israeli strikes overnight and into Monday. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. Israeli officials say an attacker in a vehicle ran over several people at a bus stop in northern Israel before opening fire, killing a man in his 70s. Police said officers shot and killed the attacker, whose identity was not immediately disclosed. Police referred to it as a terrorist attack, indicating they believe the assailant was a Palestinian militant. Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said a man in his 70s was killed and another man, around 20 years old, was taken to a hospital in serious condition. There has been a surge in Palestinian attacks since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel ignited the war in the Gaza Strip. At the same time, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinians. Thousands of people are trapped in the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip after Israeli forces encircled part of it on Sunday, Palestinian officials said. Israel ordered the evacuation of the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood, telling people to leave by a single route on foot to Muwasi, a sprawling cluster of tent camps along the coast. Thousands fled, but residents said many were trapped by Israeli forces. The Rafah municipality said Monday that thousands were still trapped, including first responders from the Civil Defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government, and the Palestinian Red Crescent. Israel’s defense minister says it is trying to avoid harming civilians as it strikes Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Israel Katz’s statement came nearly a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians,mostly women and children, according to local health officials. Katz said Monday that “Israel is not fighting the civilians in Gaza and is doing everything that international law requires to mitigate harm to civilians.” He went on to blame Hamas for any civilian deaths, saying the militant group “fights in civilian dress, from civilian homes, and from behind civilians,” putting them in danger. He said Israel would not halt its offensive until Hamas releases all its hostages and is no longer in control of Gaza or a threat to Israel. Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 25 Palestinians, including several women and children, according to three hospitals. The strikes come nearly a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas with a surprise bombardment that killed hundreds. Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City received 11 bodies from strikes overnight into Monday, including three women and four children. One of the strikes killed two children, their parents, their grandmother and their uncle. Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis received seven bodies from strikes overnight and four from strikes the previous day. The European Hospital received three bodies from a strike near Khan Younis. Gaza’s Health Ministry said Sunday that the Palestinian death toll from the 17-month war has passed 50,000. It has said that women and children make up more than half the dead but does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. An American trauma surgeon working in Gaza says most of the patients injured in an Israeli attack on the largest hospital in southern Gaza had been previously wounded when Israel resumed airstrikes last week. Californian surgeon Feroze Sidhwa, who is working with the medical charity MedGlobal, said Monday he had been in the intensive care unit at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis when an airstrike hit surgical wards on Sunday. Most of the injured had been recovering from wounds suffered in airstrikes last week when Israel resumed the war, he said. “They were already trauma patients and now they’ve been traumatized for a second time,” Sidhwa, who was raised in Flint, Mich., told Australian Broadcasting Corp. Sidhwa said he had operated on a man and boy days before who died in the attack.",Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill scores in Gaza as Egypt offers new ceasefire proposal,The Associated Press,AP News,2025-03-24T07:26:54,2025-03-24T18:08:21,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/congo-m23-nangaa-rwanda-peace-talks-minerals-f6116d5f602bfdf0ab85fde97fa8dadb,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — The leader of the rebels who captured two key cities in eastern Congo tells The Associated Press that international sanctions and Congo’s proposed minerals deal with the United States in search of peace will not stop the fighting. Meanwhile, neighboring countries announced a broader peace facilitation team to seek a resolution to the conflict. With a $5 million bounty placed on the rebel leaders by Congo’s government, “we will fight like people who got nothing to lose in order to secure the future of our country,” said Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance that includes the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group. Nangaa dismissed Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi’s comments last week that his country — whose mineral resources are estimated to be worth $24 trillion and critical to much of the world’s technology — is looking for a minerals partnership with the U.S. The U.S. government has not publicly spoken about any such deal, which local observers say could be similar to the Trump administration’s recent offer to Ukraine to help end the war with Russia. “This problem can be better resolved by the concerned Congolese, not foreigners with different geopolitical agendas,” Nangaa told the AP over the weekend. “Trying to bribe U.S. with mines can undermine U.S. credibility.” The rebel leader also rejected the outcome of last week’s meeting between Congolese and Rwandan leaders in Qatar, saying such a move to achieve peace without his group’s involvement would fail. He said the rebels can only have a dialogue with Congo’s government if the country acknowledges their grievances and the root causes of the conflict. “Anything regarding us which are done without us, it’s against us,” Nangaa said. Since launching a major escalation of their decadelong fighting with Congolese forces in January, the M23 rebels have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and several towns in eastern Congo, prompting fears of regional war involving neighbors whose militaries are also on the ground. Efforts to achieve a ceasefire collapsed last week after the rebels pulled out of talks facilitated by Angola, condemning European Union sanctions on its leaders. After Angola’s president and chairperson of the African Union, Joao Lourenco, withdrew as the key mediator on Monday, southern and eastern African leaders announced at a joint summit that a panel of five former African presidents to help seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The panel will appoint a mediator to replace the Angolan leader, the president’s office in Congo said Tuesday in a statement posted on X. Also Monday, the M23 rebels said their planned withdrawal from the strategic town of Walikale, which they captured last week, is delayed because Congolese forces are allegedly still positioned in the area with attack drones. M23 spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said their presence “compromises” peace initiatives. The AP has reached out to Congo’s military. Holding Walikale gives the rebels control of a road linking four provinces in eastern Congo — North Kivu, South Kivu, Tshopo and Maniema — effectively cutting off Congolese army positions. The M23 is the most potent of about 100 armed factions vying for control in eastern Congo. It is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who failed to integrate into the Congolese army. The group says it is defending ethnic Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination. Although U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 forces from neighboring Rwanda supporting the rebels in Congo, Nangaa asserted that the rebel alliance is independent and seeks to address “the root cause of more than 30 years of instability in our country.”",Congo rebel leader says sanctions or minerals deal with the US won’t stop fighting in the east,Chinedu Asadu,AP News,2025-03-24T10:27:35,2025-03-25T06:12:44,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7v40e2p43o,"Chad has condemned a senior Sudanese general's threat to target its airports, calling it a ""declaration of war"". Its foreign ministry said it would respond according to international law if a ""square metre of Chadian territory is threatened"". The warning follows comments from Lt-Gen Yasir al-Atta, the deputy commander of Sudan's army, who said the UAE was using Chad's airports to deliver weapons to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The Sudanese army has repeatedly accused the UAE of supporting its rival, the RSF, throughout the brutal two-year civil war, which has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. UN experts have described accusations of the UAE smuggling weapons to the RSF through Chad as ""credible"", but the UAE has denied this. Lt-Gen Atta's comments follow Sudan's recent decision to take the UAE to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over its alleged support of the RSF. Speaking at a ceremony for an army officer killed in a drone attack by the RSF on Friday while the army was recapturing the presidential palace, he said airports in Chad's capital N'Djamena and the eastern city Amdjarass were ""legitimate targets"". Lt-Gen Atta said ""retaliatory action"" would be taken against the UAE, South Sudan and Chad's President Mahamat Déby. South Sudan has also been accused of backing the RSF. It has denied backing any side in the conflict. ""We know what we are saying, and our words are not a joke at all, nor are they spoken lightly,"" Lt-Gen Atta warned. The BBC has reached out to Sudan's authorities for clarification on his comments. They reflect the Sudanese army's deep frustration with not only the UAE, but neighbouring countries, accused of allowing their territory to be used as supply routes for the RSF. In December, Sudan's defence ministry said that the weapons supplied included strategic drones that carry guided missiles. Chad has positioned itself as neutral, but the war of words exposes the growing regional instability caused by Sudan's civil war, which is complicated by the involvement of external players. ""General al-Atta should stop uttering foolish threats and focus on the urgent need for an immediate cessation of hostilities and engage without delay in a constructive dialogue in favour of a peaceful and lasting solution,"" said Chad, highlighting that it is hosting hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees, mostly from the neighbouring region of Darfur, which is largely under RSF control. The harsh exchange came as the RSF claimed to have seized al-Malha in Darfur, a town located on a vital trade route from Chad and Libya. It also serves as a key crossroads leading to el-Fasher some 200km (125 miles) away, the last state capital in Darfur still in army hands, which the RSF has besieged for nearly a year. The group said it had ""encircled the enemy... leaving behind 380 dead,"" after months of fighting with a coalition of armed groups allied to the Sudanese army known as the Joint Forces. It claimed to have ""liberated"" the area and declared that it ""remained steadfast in [its] determination to end this war in favour of the Sudanese people"". The BBC spoke to two members of local activist groups, known as Emergency Response Rooms, who had been co-ordinating humanitarian relief for the town. We are not using their names to protect them and their families. They say that after the RSF took control of the town, it closed off roads to prevent people from fleeing and imposed a lockdown. Institutions are not working, says Ahmed (not his real name). The hospital is not functioning, the main market's been looted, and no-one's getting water, normally delivered from storage tanks by vendors. Estimates so far of those killed in the RSF advance range from 35 to 48. Ahmed, who monitors Darfur from outside the country, said this was because the group had cut off internet communications in al-Malha. He has not been able to make contact with his mother and 11 brothers and sisters to find out what happened to them Ismail (not his real name) managed to flee with his family during the night, to the village of Kenana, where many of those displaced from al-Malha are also struggling to get food and water. Others took refuge in the valleys among nomadic goat and camel herders, they told the BBC. Ismail said a lot of the people killed were merchants in the market, because they belonged to the Zaghawa community, the ethnic base of the Joint Forces. The RSF also burned down the homes of those they thought had a connection to either the military or the government. At least two traditional community leaders were killed, said Ahmed. Analysts say the RSF seems determined to consolidate its grip on its Darfur stronghold after months of army gains in central Sudan, and the capital, Khartoum. The leader of the group, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, has vowed to fight on in Khartoum despite the army's significant advance last week. The paramilitary fighters remain scattered in parts of the city centre including the airport, as well as the capital's south and west. But the army says it's been steadily seizing key infrastructure and buildings, including the central bank and state intelligence headquarters, as it consolidates control over the area. Fully reclaiming the rest of the capital would mark a pivotal point in the war, giving the Sudanese army a strategic advantage in the country's other battlefields. The military and government ministries moved their headquarters to Port Sudan after the RSF overran Khartoum early in the war But many observers believe there's a danger of de-facto partition, with the two warring parties and their backers entrenching themselves in their zones of influence.",Chad condemns Sudan's airport threat as 'declaration of war' ,Barbara Plett Usher,BBC News,2025-03-24T10:54:55,2025-03-24T10:54:55,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/turkey-istanbul-mayor-protest-journalists-detained-erdogan-f6e803ab00ce86097aba78b3a94ef061,"ISTANBUL (AP) — A media union said Turkish authorities arrested several journalists at their homes in a crackdown Monday, amid growing protests over the jailing of Istanbul’s mayor, a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A court on Sunday formally arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges. His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law. The Disk-Basin-Is media workers’ union said at least eight reporters and photojournalists were detained in what it called an “attack on press freedoms and the people’s right to learn the truth.” It called for their immediate release. The social media platform X said it was objecting to multiple court orders from Turkish authorities to block more than 700 accounts, including of news organizations, journalists and political figures in Turkey. A total of 1,133 people have been detained since the mayor was arrested at his home, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. As many as 123 police officers were injured in the protests, he said, adding that materials such as acid, firebombs and knives were seized. “Some circles have been exploiting the right to assemble and demonstrate, attempting to disrupt public order, incite street unrest and attack our police,” Yerlikaya said on social media. The minister said some of the detained were identified as having ties to groups listed as terrorist organizations and others had criminal records. Hundreds of thousands of people have come out for the largely peaceful protests across Turkey in support of the mayor. There has been some violence, with police deploying water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray and firing plastic pellets at protesters in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Some protesters hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at riot police. In a message on social media, Imamoglu urged people to rally outside city hall and other locations for a sixth night on Monday. He also called on youths to avoid clashes and asked police to treat demonstrators with kindness. “I’m working hard, I will work even harder. Where I am does not matter,” he said. The mayor’s jailing is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject the accusations and insist that Turkey’s courts operate independently. Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied. A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution. The Interior Ministry later said Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a “temporary measure.” The municipality previously appointed an acting mayor from its governing council. In a televised address following a Cabinet meeting, Erdogan accused the opposition party’s chairman Ozgur Ozel, who has called for peaceful protests, of disturbing public order instead of addressing the alleged corruption. He also said he would be held to account for the protests. “I have made this call several times before, and today I am repeating it: Stop disturbing our citizens’ peace with provocations. If you have the courage, account for the corruption, theft, bribes taken, and irregularities committed,” Erdogan said. Erdogan said: “of course, there will be political accountability for these actions in parliament and legal accountability in court.” Addressing demonstrators outside city hall for a sixth consecutive night, Ozel urged supporters to boycott a number of pro-government companies and television stations. He also challenged Erdogan and the Istanbul chief public prosecutor to broadcast Imamoglu’s trial live on state television, to allow the jailed mayor to respond to the allegations and “expose their lies.” About 15 minutes after Ozel addressed the crowd, police intervened with tear gas and plastic pellets to disperse the demonstrators. Imamoglu was taken to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, as more than 1.7 million members of his opposition Republican People’s Party, or CHP, held a primary election, endorsing him as its presidential candidate. Millions of non-members also cast votes in a “solidarity ballot,” the party said. Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul. One was replaced with a government appointee. A further 44 suspects were released under judicial control. Thousands of protesters rallied outside Istanbul’s city hall to voice anger over what they see as a crackdown on democratic freedoms. Tensions remained high as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas minutes after opposition leader Ozel’s daily address concluded. Protesters, many young and masked to avoid identification, hurled harsh words to the police and Erdogan and booed those in their ranks who threw bottles and flares at security forces to avoid elevated violence akin to Sunday’s police interventions. “I think it can’t get any worse than this,” said one female demonstrator who did not want to be named due to fear of detention. “We will never accept this. If necessary, I will come every day.” Others echoed her sentiment. “There is a coup against our democracy right now,” said an older male protester who also wished to remain anonymous. “We are here for our children, for the youth. We want them to be free so this country can be more beautiful.” Several protesters said their aim was not to support specific politicians but to stand up for the Turkish Republic. “I would like to say my name, but I cannot,” one man said. “The reason I came here is not Ozel or Imamoglu. I came here to defend my own rights as the youth of Ataturk (founder of the Turkish Republic). Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 43 protesters were detained Monday, and condemned what he called “vile insults” toward Erdogan and his late mother, vowing not to tolerate “such indecency.” Ali Mahir Basarir, a legislator from the main opposition Republican People’s Party, told the AP that the authorities used “pre-determined provocateurs” to justify crackdowns. “They start attacking the protesters before the rally is over,” he said. “All they want is a good future. They are exercising their constitutional rights.” and urged the police to not mistreat protesters. Meanwhile, authorities were investigating the office of Ankara’s mayor, another popular opposition figure, over the alleged misuse of public funds concerning the organization of 33 concerts, the municipality said Monday. Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey’s largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president’s Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan’s party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities. The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan’s governing party.",Turkey arrests journalists after President Erdogan's top rival is jailed,,AP News,2025-03-24T04:03:30,2025-03-24T20:58:10,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250324000700315,"SEOUL, March 24 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Monday denounced the latest annual joint military drills by South Korea and the United States, warning it will continue to strengthen its striking power to overwhelm any threats from its enemies. The disarmament and peace institute at North Korea's foreign ministry issued the condemnation after Seoul and Washington wrapped up their 11-day annual Freedom Shield exercise Thursday. Calling the exercise a ""planned and provocative nuclear war rehearsal,"" North Korea said the aggressive and offensive nature of this year's drills was the highest in history, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). ""Having a formidable attack power that no one can stop and an overwhelming striking power is the surest guarantee to preventing war and effectively containing and controlling any threat and blackmail from aggressors,"" the institute said in a statement carried by the KCNA. North Korea vowed to ""consistently renew and strengthen its responses in all areas to overwhelm any military act by its enemies,"" it added. North Korea has long denounced the allies' joint military drills as rehearsals for an invasion and uses them as a pretext for provocations. South Korea and the U.S. have said their exercises are defensive in nature. The North released a barrage of statements denouncing the joint drills as a ""dangerous provocative act"" and fired several ballistic missiles, believed to be close-range ones, on the first day of the exercise. But it did not carry out major provocations, such as the firing of long-range ballistic missiles, this year.

https://apnews.com/article/philippines-south-china-sea-dispute-xi-jinping-6a042bcf422b577458f5e09d4d1622ef,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine defense chief on Monday called China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea “the biggest fiction and lie” that no Southeast Asian country would accept and said that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s aggressive policies have undermined international goodwill fostered by his predecessors. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro fired off his latest tirade against China’s increasingly assertive actions in the region on the same day that the Philippine coast guard separately reported new incidents involving Chinese forces in the Scarborough Shoal, a hotly disputed fishing atoll in the disputed waterway. A Chinese military helicopter appeared to have tailed, but didn’t closely approach, a Philippine lightplane undertaking a routine patrol Monday over Scarborough. Chinese forces have separately installed a new floating barrier to prevent Filipino fishermen from entering a lagoon in the shoal, which lies off the northwestern Philippines, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela told an online news briefing. There was no immediate comment from Chinese officials, but in the past they have repeatedly asserted that Beijing has had sovereign control over the Scarborough Shoal and most of the South China Sea since ancient times. An international arbitration panel invalidated China’s expansive claims in a 2016 ruling based on the 1982 U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea, but Beijing refused to participate in the Philippines-initiated arbitration and continues to defy the decision. In a speech marking the anniversary of the Philippine military’s Western Command on Palawan province, which faces the South China Sea, Teodoro underscored the need for a “stronger national defense posture” and continued security engagement with allied countries to address the threat posed by Chinese aggression in the waterway, a key global trade route. “No ASEAN country accepts the legitimacy of that 10-dash line, because that is the biggest fiction and lie that can be sold to any right-thinking person,” Teodoro told Filipino forces. He was referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation regional bloc that has been negotiating a nonaggression pact called the “code of conduct” with China to prevent the territorial conflicts from spiraling out of control. ASEAN state members the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have been involved in the long-simmering territorial standoffs in the South China Sea. Taiwan also lays a claim similar to that of China, which has demarcated the extent of its declared territory with 10 linear dashes on Chinese maps. Teodoro said that Xi runs a “small dictatorship and autocracy” and that his “clique” in the Chinese Communist Party is to blame for what the defense chief called Beijing’s aggressive and illegal policies, not Xi’s predecessors or the Chinese people. “It’s caused by Xi Jinping and his abusive ways … that would possibly destroy his leadership of his party in China and the goodwill that was nurtured by his predecessors,” Teodoro told reporters. China’s aggressive actions in the disputed waters have prompted the Philippines to build stronger security alliances with friendly countries, Teodoro said. The Philippines, he said, would sign a visiting forces agreement with New Zealand next month to allow their forces to enter each other’s territory for joint military exercises. Negotiations have reached the final stage for a similar agreement with Canada, he said. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has authorized the start of negotiations for such an agreement with France, Teodoro said. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is due to meet with Teodoro on Friday in Manila for talks that Philippine officials said would spotlight concerns over China’s assertive actions in the contested waters and ways to strengthen the decades-long U.S.-Philippines treaty alliance.",Philippine defense chief calls China's claims in the South China Sea 'the biggest fiction and lie',Jim Gomez,AP News,2025-03-24T08:50:50,2025-03-24T11:22:21,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/senior-hamas-official-killed-in-targeted-strike-on-gaza-hospital-as-idf-offensive-widens/,"An Israeli airstrike on a Gaza hospital killed a senior member of Hamas’s political bureau Sunday night as the military moved to expand its renewed offensive across the Strip. Israel said it used precision weaponry to target and kill Ismail Barhoum at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, referring to him as a “key Hamas terrorist,” as the Palestinian terror group confirmed his death and said he had been undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in a previous strike. The strike was one of dozens reported across the territory Sunday and into the early morning hours of Monday, with a separate strike in the Khan Younis area reportedly killing a senior Hamas education official. The Israel Defense Forces also indicated it was preparing to expand ground operations, redeploying an armored division that had been stationed on the border with Lebanon. Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed the widening of the offensive in a statement hailing the killing of Barhoum. He described the Hamas official, a member of the terror group’s political bureau previously involved in financing its activities, as “the new Hamas prime minister in Gaza, who replaced Issam Da’alis, the previous prime minister who was eliminated a few days ago.” He was at least the fourth member of Hamas’s political bureau killed since Tuesday, when Israel resumed airstrikes in the territory after an impasse over continuing a ceasefire. Earlier Sunday, an Israeli airstrike near Khan Younis killed Salah al-Bardawil, another senior member of its political bureau. Out of the 20 members of Hamas’s political bureau elected in 2021, 11 have been assassinated during the war in Gaza. Seven are either certain or highly likely to be outside the Gaza Strip. The IDF said the strike was carried out following “an extensive intelligence-gathering process,” and that a “precision munition” was used to mitigate harm to civilians. The attack was caught on camera by both Al Jazeera and BBC Arabic. Footage from the scene following the blast showed that the hospital building was largely undamaged in the strike, except for fire blazing in one section off a stairwell. Palestinian health officials claimed the attack killed two people — Barhoum and a 16-year-old boy who had recently undergone surgery. Footage on social media appeared to show people extricating bodies and injured people from the rubble. “The Hamas terrorist organization exploits civilian infrastructure while brutally endangering the Gazan population. The cynical use of an active hospital as a shelter for the planning and executing of murderous terrorist attacks is in direct violation of international law,” the IDF statement read. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said the strike hit the surgery department at the hospital, and a Hamas source told AFP that “Barhoum was receiving treatment after sustaining critical injuries in an airstrike targeting his home in Khan Younis at dawn last Tuesday.” Barhoum was a member of Hamas’s political wing and had been involved in financial activities for the terror group, according to the European Union, which placed sanctions on him last year. In a separate announcement on Sunday, the IDF and Shin Bet security agency said two senior Hamas military wing commanders had been killed in recent airstrikes in the Gaza Strip. According to the army, Ahmad Salman ‘Awj Shimali, the deputy commander of the Gaza City Brigade, and Jamil Omar Jamil Wadiya, the commander of the brigade’s Shejaiya Battalion, were killed in airstrikes in recent days. The military did not detail where or when they were killed. According to the IDF, Shimali was “responsible for operations, planning the offensive strategy and building the brigade’s force in preparation for Hamas’s brutal massacre on October 7, [2023],” and during the war, he was responsible for the deployment of the brigade’s force. Wadiya took over the Shejaiya Battalion after his predecessors were killed in December 2023, according to the army. On December 2, 2023, the IDF killed Shejaiya Battalion commander Wissam Farhat and, a week later, it killed his replacement Emad Qariqa. “Wadiya was responsible for deploying the battalion’s forces against IDF troops and operated to restore and reorganize the battalion,” the military said. The statement added that Wadiya was also involved in a 2011 anti-tank missile attack on an Israeli school bus driving near the Gaza border. The attack killed 16-year-old Daniel Viflic. On Monday morning, Gazan media sources reported that overnight strikes had also killed Manar Abu Khater, director of education at the eastern Khan Younis education directorate for the Strip’s Hamas government, among others. A deadly strike was also reported in the Nuseirat area of central Gaza. Major mobilization of troops to Gaza Following the killing of Barhoum, Katz said that the ongoing offensive against Hamas was “expanding,” vowing that Israel would continue its strikes until the 59 hostages still held by terrorists in Gaza are released. The IDF said Sunday that thousands of troops were preparing to join military operations in Gaza, ramping up the military’s renewed ground offensive against the terror group, which has thus far been carried out with relatively limited forces. The army’s 36th Division, which spent months in the north and took part in a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon, was redeployed to the Southern Command and had begun preparations for military operations in the Gaza Strip, the IDF said. Currently, only the IDF’s Gaza Division and 252nd Reserve Division are carrying out operations inside the Gaza Strip. The move would add thousands of more troops to the offensive. Israel has threatened to expand operations in the Strip as it seeks to pile pressure on Hamas to free hostages still being held in the Strip. According to a report by Channel 12, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir was pushing to widen the military’s renewed offensive, citing Zamir as telling political officials in recent meetings that “Hamas is stalling for time, it’s a strategy, not a tactic.” “The IDF’s operation hurts [Hamas] and causes some movement, but it doesn’t lead it to release the hostages,” Zamir reportedly said. “Therefore, there is no choice, the pressure must be increased.” Despite the resumption of military activity in the Gaza Strip, the IDF Home Front Command on Sunday said it was further easing restrictions on civilians in southern Israel. Following an assessment, the Home Front Command said it has adjusted the activity scale permitted in the Gaza border communities from “partial activity” to “full activity,” meaning there would be no restrictions on schools and workplaces. Over the past week, schools and workplaces were only allowed to open if an adequate bomb shelter could be reached in time. Gatherings were still limited, however, to 2,000 people in several communities close to the Strip. Gatherings had been capped at 500 indoors and 100 outdoors over the past week. There have been just two rocket attacks from Gaza since Israel resumed its military campaign. Hamas on Thursday launched three long-range rockets at central Israel, and on Friday it fired two rockets at the southern coastal city of Ashkelon. New body formed to enable ‘voluntary’ departure of Gazans On Saturday night, the security cabinet approved a suggestion by Katz to establish a new administration in the Defense Ministry tasked with enabling Palestinians to “voluntarily” leave the Gaza Strip. In a statement Sunday morning, Katz’s office said the new directorate would work to “prepare for and enable safe and controlled passage of Gaza residents for their voluntary departure to third countries, including securing their movement, establishing movement routes, checking pedestrians at designated crossings in the Gaza Strip, as well as coordinating the provision of infrastructure that will enable passage by land, sea and air to the destination countries.” The head of the directorate will be selected by Katz soon, his office said. The statement added that the efforts to enable Gazans who seek to migrate from the Strip to do so are being carried out “subject to Israeli and international law, and in accordance with the vision of US President Donald Trump.” “We are working with all means to implement the US president’s vision, and we will allow any Gaza resident who wants to move to a third state to do so,” Katz said. The military resumed fighting in Gaza last week at the instruction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed that all negotiations for a hostage deal moving forward would be held under fire after Hamas rejected proposals to extend phase one of the previous ceasefire. Hamas has insisted on sticking to the terms of the deal agreed to by Netanyahu in January, which required the sides to begin holding talks on phase two in early February. Israel has largely refused to do so. Hamas refused proposals to keep the ceasefire afloat by extending its first phase. While Israel says its military campaign is necessary to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages, the families of many of those held captive have called for a renewed ceasefire. Terror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF. On Sunday, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed that the death toll since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas had crossed 50,000, adding that another 113,274 have been injured since the October 7, onslaught, when Hamas-led forces invaded, killing 1,200 and abducting the hostages in an unprecedented assault that overtly targeted civilians. The figures could not be independently verified and do not differentiate between combatants and civilians. Israel said it had killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools and mosques.",Senior Hamas official killed in targeted strike on Gaza hospital as IDF widens offensive,"Emanuel Fabian, Nurit Yohanan, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-03-23T23:44:53,2025-03-24T09:29:11,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/thailand-uyghur-deportation-china-xinjiang-162435b1c864e905313455a97ed77f1f,"BANGKOK (AP) — In late February, representatives of a Thai Muslim organization brought a reassuring message to 40 Uyghur men terrified they were going to be sent back to China: The government had no immediate plans to deport them. Less than 72 hours later, the men were on a plane bound for China’s far west Xinjiang region, where U.N. experts say they could face torture or other punishment. Thailand decided to deport the men more than a month earlier, while denying plans to do so to the public, lawmakers and Muslim religious leaders until almost the very end, according to testimony from parliamentary inquiries, interviews, meeting notes and voice messages. That gave the detainees and their advocates no chance to make a last-ditch appeal before they were bundled off and sent back to China. Now, the Thai government is dealing with the fallout of a move that outraged human right activists and allies. The decision is at the heart of Thai parliamentary inquiries and a diplomatic rift between Thailand and its biggest military ally. The United States has imposed sanctions on multiple Thai officials while the European Union and other allies issued condemnations. Thai officials visited Xinjiang last week to meet some of the deported Uyghurs and said they are being treated well. They have also said the men returned voluntarily, despite evidence to the contrary. The Uyghurs are a Turkic, majority Muslim ethnicity native to Xinjiang. After decades of conflict over suppression of their cultural identity, Beijing launched a brutal crackdown on the Uyghurs that some Western governments deem a genocide. The men deported last month were part of a larger group of Uyghurs detained in Thailand in 2014 after fleeing China. That left Thailand facing competing demands from Beijing and Washington. Beijing said the Uyghurs were terrorists and wanted them sent back, but hasn’t presented evidence. Uyghur activists and Western officials said the men are innocent and have urged their resettlement elsewhere. Facing potential backlash from all sides, Thailand kept the men in detention for over a decade. That changed when Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra took office last year. Her father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, has close links to top Chinese officials. Thai officials began secretly discussing plans to deport the Uyghurs as early as December, a month after Paetongtarn met Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the AP earlier reported. China sent a formal request to repatriate the Uyghurs on Jan. 8, according to records of a parliamentary inquiry held after the men had been sent back and lawmaker Rangsiman Rome. The same day, the men were asked to sign deportation papers, alarming them. They made a public appeal and went on a hunger strike, giving pause to Thai officials. Nonetheless, on Jan. 17, the National Security Council decided behind closed doors to deport the Uyghur detainees at a meeting attended by the ministers of defense and justice, the council’s Secretary-General Chatchai Bangchuad revealed to the parliamentary investigation. Chatchai said the decision was based in part on commitments from China that the men would be treated well and that Thailand would be allowed to check on them. That’s when the denials began. Shortly after the Jan. 17 meeting, Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters the government had no immediate plans for deportation. In a Jan. 29 parliamentary inquiry, the Thai government again denied plans to deport the men, according to the records of the meeting and an interview with Thai lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang. Thai Senator Angkhana Neelapaijit said the justice minister told her personally there were no plans to send the men to China just a week before they were deported. The Ministry of Justice referred the AP to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment. The foreign ministry declined to comment. In a Feb. 24 meeting, representatives of Sheikhul Islam, an official Islamic organization close to the Thai authorities, told the Uyghurs the government said they wouldn’t be sent to China, according to notes and recordings obtained by AP. A detainee described what Sheikhul Islam told them in two recordings, one sent to an advocate and the other to a relative in Europe. “They said they’re in touch with the government and they cannot guarantee the government won’t send us back later, but till now, they’re saying we won’t be sent back,” the detainee said. Both recordings were provided to the AP by the advocate and are two to three minutes long. The advocate asked for anonymity for themself and for the detainee to protect them from retribution. The description of the meeting in the recordings was corroborated by notes taken by a participant and shared by an activist, as well as an interview with another person with direct knowledge of the situation. That person, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, added that at least some of the Sheikhul Islam representatives believed that the men were not about to be deported based on assurances from the government. Sheikhul Islam declined to comment. The notes also make it clear the men did not want to go to China, contrary to the government’s claims. “The detainees asked for a prayer for them to not be deported,” the notes said. Three days later, in the early morning hours of Feb. 27, the men were put on trucks and driven away in the dead of night, black sheets drawn over the windows. The next day, Prime Minister Paetongtarn confirmed to reporters that she had discussed deportation with Chinese officials during a visit to Beijing in February. The Prime Minister’s office referred a request for comment to the “relevant parties” without saying who those parties were. The Ministry of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the wake of the deportation, Kannavee, Angkhana, Rangsiman and other lawmakers expressed outrage and demanded answers. The Thai parliament’s national security committee held an inquiry and called for footage of the deportation to be released. At first, top Thai officials said there were no other countries willing to offer asylum to the Uyghurs, but the U.S. and other countries have said they made repeated offers to take the men. In a further attempt to address the criticism, over half a dozen senior Thai officials visited Xinjiang last week at Beijing’s invitation. Select Thai media were invited, but an AP request to participate was denied. “There is no need to worry about the Uyghurs,” government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsab said Thursday in a statement. “They are living happily with their families.” Press releases and instructions given to media show the trip was carefully managed: The delegation met only six of the 40 men, according to a spokesperson, while media on the trip were ordered to avoid shooting images of the Uyghurs and Chinese officials, according to notes circulating among Thai reporters seen by AP. Images released from the visit blurred out almost all faces except those of Thai officials. Their deportation also caused a diplomatic rift between Thailand and Western countries. On March 14, the U.S. State Department announced visa sanctions on an unknown number of Thai officials for their role in the deportations, while the EU parliament passed a resolution condemning the deportation. The officials sanctioned by the U.S. were not named. Xinjiang authorities did not respond to a faxed request for comment. During a press conference last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning called the U.S. sanctions “illegal.” “China ... opposes the U.S. using human rights as a pretext to manipulate Xinjiang-related issues, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and disrupt normal law enforcement cooperation,” Mao said. ___ Kang reported from Beijing.

Early on Monday, police detained 10 Turkish journalists ""for covering the protests"", the MLSA rights group said in a statement, saying most were covering the mass demonstrations outside City Hall, where tens of thousands rallied late Sunday.
As on previous nights, the gathering descended into fierce clashes between protesters and riot police who could be seen kicking and beating people as they sought to disperse the crowds in Istanbul and elsewhere, AFP correspondents said.
Istanbul Governor Davut Gul accused demonstrators of ""damaging mosques and cemeteries"" in a post on X.
""We ask our citizens to stay away from environments where masked people are present and not to participate in any unauthorised demonstrations. Any attempt to disrupt public order will not be tolerated,"" he wrote.
Faced with the massive protests, Turkey's authorities sought to shut down more than 700 accounts on X, the online platform said Sunday.
""We object to multiple court orders from the Turkish Information and Communication Technologies Authority to block over 700 accounts of news organisations, journalists, political figures, students, and others within Turkiye,"" its communications team said in a statement.
""We believe this decision from the Turkish government is not only unlawful, it hinders millions of Turkish users from news and political discourse in their country,"" it said.

The IDF does not name the person it targeted in the hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, but unverified reports from Gaza and the Saudi al-Hadath channel claim it was Ismail Barhoum, a senior member of Hamas’s politburo. In a joint statement with the Shin Bet, the IDF says the strike was carried out following “an extensive intelligence-gathering process.” It says a “precision munition” was used in order to mitigate harm to civilians. Palestinian media report an Israeli airstrike targeting the second floor of the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza's Khan Younis. There is no immediate comment from the IDF. Israel has long accused Hamas of using Gaza’s hospitals to hide personnel, weapons and command centers, but in the past, the IDF has carried out raids on such facilities with ground troops. “The Hamas terrorist organization exploits civilian infrastructure while brutally endangering the Gazan population. The cynical use of an active hospital as a shelter for the planning and executing of murderous terrorist attacks is in direct violation of international law,” the statement reads.","Israel confirms airstrike on Gaza hospital, says it targeted ‘key Hamas terrorist’",Emanuel Fabian,The Times of Israel,2025-03-23T20:17:29,2025-03-23T22:56:52,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/new-canadian-prime-minister-carney-will-run-in-ottawa-area-district-as-he-seeks-to-join-parliament-1868494,"TORONTO: New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will run in an Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament for the first time, two officials familiar with the matter said Saturday, a day before Carney triggers an early general election before a vote on April 28. The election will take place against the backdrop of a trade war and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Carney will run to represent the suburban Ottawa area of Nepean. The election campaign for 343 seats or districts in the House of Commons will last 37 days. The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister. Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader on March 9 following a leadership race by the governing party. Carney, sworn in as Canada’s 24th prime minister on March 14, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate. The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war. Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has upended Canadian politics. What Trump hasn’t said is that the almost daily attacks on Canada’s sovereignty have infuriated Canadians. That has led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers. The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump. Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. Carney still hasn’t had a phone call with Trump and that might not happen now until after the election. Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but he has not yet mentioned Carney’s name. Carney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013, he became the first noncitizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England — helping to manage the impact of Brexit. Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney’s main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada’s federal election this year until Trump’s near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them. Poilievre, 45, for years the party’s go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put “Canada first.” He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada’s public broadcaster. His party announced that it won’t allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes.",New Canadian Prime Minister Carney will run in Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament,AP,Deccan Chronicle,2025-03-22T21:39:14,2025-03-22T21:39:39,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrdv84rg4do,"Pope Francis has appeared at his window of the Gemelli hospital in Rome and offered a blessing for the first time since being admitted on 14 February. The 88-year-old pontiff was discharged minutes later and doctors say he will need at least two months of rest at the Vatican. During the past five weeks, he presented ""two very critical episodes"" where his ""life was in danger"", Dr Sergio Alfieri, one of the doctors treating the Pope, said. Pope Francis was never intubated and always remained alert and oriented, Dr Alfieri said. Even though the Pope is not completely healed, he no longer has pneumonia and will return to work as soon as possible, if the trend continues, doctors say. Mayor of Rome Roberto Gualtieri told the BBC he felt ""a really great joy, great emotion to see Pope Francis leaving the hospital"". ""It's a great gift to the city and to the world... we support him and feel really close to him,"" the mayor said. Crowds gathered outside the Gemelli hospital in Rome to see the Pope A crowd of people gathered outside the hospital on Sunday, waiting for the Pope to appear. ""When I saw him I felt, to be honest, a little relieved,"" said Bishop Larry Kulick, from the Diocese of Greensburg in the US state of Pennsylvania. ""I felt just overjoyed to see him."" ""I cried all the time because the love we breathe in this little square of this hospital was like heaven,"" said Ilaria Della Bidia, a singer from Rome. Ana Matos from Brazil said she ""just arrived from Brazil today"" and arrived outside the hospital ""30 seconds before he appeared"". She said that ""it was an amazing feeling, like when I had my son. I was so happy to see him healthy and I could see him smile"". The Pope had only previously been seen by the public once since he was admitted to hospital, in a photograph released by the Vatican last week, which showed him praying in a hospital chapel. Earlier this month, an audio recording of Pope Francis was played in St Peter's Square in Vatican City. His voice was breathless as he thanked the Catholic faithful for their prayers. Pope Francis has spent 12 years as leader of the Roman Catholic Church.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4ynpzk8d8o,"Israel has carried out multiple air strikes on Lebanon after several rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel, in the worst violence since a ceasefire came into effect in November. The Israeli military said it had hit dozens of rocket launchers and a command centre belonging to Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group, in southern Lebanon. Lebanon's health ministry said seven people, including a child, were killed and 40 injured in the air strikes. Several armed groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah and Palestinian factions, and no-one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Hours after the first set of strikes, a second wave of attacks were carried out at night on targets that included what the Israeli military described as command centres, infrastructure sites and a weapons storage facility in Lebanon. Saturday's rocket attack from Lebanon came days after Israel reinforced its offensive against Hamas, a Hezbollah ally, in Gaza. The Israeli military said it had intercepted three rockets in the northern Israeli town of Metula, and there were no casualties. Hezbollah said it had no involvement, and it remained committed to the ceasefire. The Lebanese military said it had dismantled ""three primitive rocket launchers"" in the south, and the country's defence minister said an investigation had been launched into the attack. The developments put pressure on a fragile truce, brokered by the US and France, that ended more than a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, the Lebanese military would deploy thousands of additional soldiers to the south of the country to prevent armed groups from attacking Israel. Hezbollah was required to remove its fighters and weapons, while the Israeli military would withdraw from positions occupied in the war. But Israel has carried out nearly daily air strikes on what it describes as Hezbollah targets, and has indicated that attacks will continue to prevent the group from rearming. The Israeli military is still occupying five locations in southern Lebanon, in what the Lebanese government says is a violation of the country's sovereignty and a breach of the deal. Israel says the Lebanese military has not yet fully deployed to those areas, and that it needs to remain at those points to guarantee the security of its border communities. Saturday's attack is further proof of the challenges facing the Lebanese army, as it tries to exert control over southern areas where Hezbollah has traditionally had a strong presence and support. Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun, who came to power in January, has said only the state should have arms in the country, in what is seen as a reference to Hezbollah's arsenal. On Saturday, he condemned ""attempts to drag Lebanon into a cycle of violence"", while Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said the escalation carried the ""risk of dragging the country into another war"". The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, said it was ""alarmed by the possible escalation of violence"", urging both Israel and Lebanon to ""uphold their commitments"". Hezbollah was battered in the conflict with Israel: many of its leaders were assassinated, hundreds of fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. The group faces the huge challenge of providing financial help to its communities affected by the war, and pressure from its opponents to disarm. Lebanon's international partners say they will only help the country if the government acts to curb Hezbollah, the most powerful group in Lebanon. Hezbollah launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The longstanding conflict escalated and led to an intense Israeli air campaign across Lebanon, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. The offensive killed about 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's attacks, and to remove it from areas along the border.",Israel strikes Lebanon after first rocket attack since ceasefire,"Hugo Bachega, Jaroslav Lukiv",BBC News,2025-03-22T06:05:27,2025-03-22T17:20:42,gemini-2.0-flash

Ukraine does not know what format the U.S. will use to negotiate with Russia in Riyadh, Tykhyi said. ""This is their choice. But we are preparing for the talks in Saudi Arabia as bilateral Ukrainian-American ones,"" the spokesperson said. Ukraine is preparing for a technical but not a political round of negotiations with the U.S., according to Tykhyi. ""There will be a meeting of professional people from the Ukrainian and American sides who can figure out all the details of how (a ceasefire) should look. We need to understand how it will work, who will control it, how it will be monitored,"" he said. Tykhyi added that Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha will not participate in the next round of talks. The upcoming Russia-U.S. consultations in Riyadh will include Russian officials Grigory Karasin, chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, and Sergei Beseda, an adviser to the director of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). The Ukrainian representatives have not yet been officially announced. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations last met in Saudi Arabia on March 11, where Ukraine agreed to a U.S. proposal for a complete ceasefire. Russia did not agree to a complete ceasefire, and Russian missile and drone attacks against Ukraine have continued.","Ukraine won't interact with Russia during talks in Saudi Arabia on March 24, Foreign Ministry says",Kateryna Hodunova,The Kyiv Independent,2025-03-21T11:57:32.000,2025-03-21T11:57:32.000,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-says-it-has-25-billion-in-frozen-russian-assets/,"The amount of frozen Russian assets in the U.K. has increased by 10 percent in a year. The U.K. government today confirmed it has frozen £25 billion in Russian assets, in the latest data released by the sanctions watchdog. The amount has increased by 10 percent in a year, or £2.3 billion, according to a report published today by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), the sanctions watchdog within the Treasury. OFSI's £25.03 billion figure relates to the frozen assets that have been reported to it since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022. In its 2023 report, OFSI said the frozen amount totaled £22.7 billion.  Europe holds a much larger amount of around €200 billion in immobilized Russian assets, most of which are held by Belgian's Euroclear. There have been mounting calls to seize the funds to support Ukraine. Earlier this month, a group of cross-party British MPs called on the government to use the frozen assets to help Kyiv in its fight against Russia. While in Kyiv on March 15, Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters that he had discussed asset seizure with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but that it was “a complicated question."" In Europe, similar conversations are taking place, with the French parliament passing a non-binding resolution to demand the EU seize Russian assets to support Ukraine.  However, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever threw cold water on the prospect of Europe taking the funds on Thursday evening, telling reporters that doing so would be “an act of war.”  In response to OFSI's latest report, Economic Secretary to the Treasury Emma Reynolds said: “The UK has frozen £25 billion worth of Russian assets and working with our allies, we have deprived Russia of over $400 billion, the equivalent to four years of Russia’s military spending. We will continue to robustly enforce our financial sanctions as part of our wider response to Russia’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine.”",UK says it has £25 billion in frozen Russian assets,Eleanor Myers,POLITICO,2025-03-21T11:07:48Z,2025-03-21T14:05:35Z,gemini-2.0-flash

Both houses of parliament passed plans this week by Merz's conservatives and the Social Democrats, who are in talks to form the next German government, that lift a long-held cap on debt. The fresh aid includes €2.5 billion this year, topped up by other contributions, including a reimbursement from the European Peace Facility. The Finance Ministry also plans to authorise commitments of €8.2 billion for the years 2026 to 2029, bringing the total to more than €11 billion.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250322000500315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, March 22 (Yonhap) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reaffirmed his willingness to ""invariably"" support Russia's war against Ukraine during his meeting with a top Russian security official, according to Pyongyang's state media Saturday. Kim held ""important and useful"" discussions with Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu in Pyongyang the previous day, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The former Russian defense minister arrived in North Korea hours before the talks. At the meeting, both sides exchanged views on a wide range of issues related to defending the security interests of the two countries as well as regional and global issues, while confirming their consensus on such issues, according to the KCNA. Kim also said it is ""the steadfast option and resolute will of the DPRK government to invariably support Russia in the struggle for defending the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and security interests in the future,"" the report said. DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. Shoigu presented an ""important signed letter"" from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Kim, the KCNA said, without disclosing details. Experts speculated that Shoigu probably traveled to the North to explain Russia's stance on a ceasefire in the Ukraine war and what it would provide to Pyongyang in return for the North's troop deployment to Russia. During phone talks this week, Putin agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump to temporarily halt strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in a partial ceasefire in the war. Shoigu's trip also came amid speculation that Kim may travel to Russia, possibly in May on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of Russia's Victory Day. Putin invited Kim to visit Moscow during his trip to Pyongyang last June for bilateral summit talks.

South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for the three-way dialogue, as the three Asian neighbors are seeking to hold a leaders' summit later this year. In Saturday's talks, the ministers are expected to broadly discuss efforts to advance the tripartite partnership in economy, culture, and people-to-people exchanges, as well as regional and global issues, including those related to the Korean Peninsula. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul (R) poses for a photo with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya (C) and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on March 21, 2025, as they arrived for a dinner reception at a hotel in Tokyo, where the three ministers have gathered for trilateral talks. (Yonhap) ""Peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula are essential for the peace and prosperity of East Asia and the world,"" Cho said in the opening remarks. ""I hope to have a candid discussion on the North Korean nuclear issue today."" Cho said the three-way talks will ""reaffirm commitment to continued cooperation and deepen future collaboration."" Iwaya highlighted the need for the three countries to ""overcome conflict and division through dialogue and cooperation."" ""While the three neighbors face difficulties, it's highly important to have candid conversations and pursue forward-looking exchanges at the same time,"" he said. Wang called the three-way cooperation the ""most promising"" framework for development in East Asia, saying the three sides are working to resume negotiations for the free trade agreement at an early date. The three ministers are scheduled to hold a joint press conference following the talks. Cho will join Iwaya for separate bilateral talks on the same day. Cho arrived in Japan Friday and met one-on-one with Wang on the same day. At Saturday's talks, the three sides are also expected to coordinate efforts to facilitate a successful summit of the countries' leaders. Japan is the host for this year's gathering, widely expected to take place later this year. They could also discuss ways the three Asian neighbors can cooperate in the context of growing uncertainties and challenges posed by Trump's trade policies amid the rivalry between Washington and Beijing. On security issues, they are likely to exchange assessments on North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations and Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine. The three Asian neighbors held their last foreign ministers' dialogue in South Korea's southern city of Busan in November 2023, attended by Wang and then Foreign Ministers Park Jin and Yoko Kamikawa.

https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-03-21/mexican-auschwitz-opens-its-doors-the-only-truth-is-that-they-dont-care-about-the-missing.html,"The ranch of horror has opened its doors. The “Mexican Auschwitz,” as it has come to be known, is a compound in the middle of harvested sugarcane fields, accessible through a black iron gate riddled with bullet holes. Inside, there is little to see: a barren field with four dusty palm trees, filthy bathrooms, and three sheds with tin roofs. On March 5, a group of people searching for their missing relatives entered unannounced and discovered human skeletal remains, signs of cremations, hundreds of items of clothing, toiletries, and even toys. But the image that has shocked the public and evoked comparisons to Nazi atrocities is the pile of abandoned shoes that was found. The Izaguirre ranch in Teuchitlán, in the Mexican state of Jalisco, is one of the many training camps used by organized crime to recruit young people to their cause. It is also known that these recruits are subjected to the cruelest practices to strip them of any fear of using knives and guns, even forcing them to kill one another. Many of the thousands of people who have disappeared in Mexico have fallen into the hands of cartels. And it is no longer known whether they are alive or dead. Several groups of searchers from Jalisco, as well as from other states, visited the ranch on Thursday. Muffled cries were heard, faded by the shock, but above all, there was despair as it became clear that there was no more evidence inside. “Why did they bring us here?” asked one person. “This is a mockery,” said another. “The only truth is that they don’t care about the missing,” one individual told the press, which was also granted access to the ranch for the first time. The Jalisco Prosecutor’s Office, at the request of the Attorney General’s Office, chartered seven buses and transported dozens of journalists, who jostled at the doors of the ranch in the stifling heat. Inside, the searchers scoured through the dirt floor with their feet and found a few socks, a blue Adidas backpack, a gold-handled razor, and some toothbrushes. “This is how they search for clues,” one of them sarcastically remarked before several microphones. The shock from the macabre discovery on March 5 was followed by disbelief at the sloppy work of the Jalisco State Prosecutor’s Office. The authorities had entered the ranch last September, arrested 10 people, rescued two, and recovered a body — but little else. The site was supposedly sealed off, yet in the months following that operation, two vehicles were stolen from the location. It was left virtually abandoned. Little to nothing is known about the survivors; no statements were taken, no fingerprints were collected, and no questions were raised about the owners of the ranch, located just a few miles from Guadalajara, one of Mexico’s wealthiest cities. All of this has been publicly condemned by Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero. This kind of negligence is attributed to either fear of organized crime or collusion with it, and such failures of law enforcement are common across the country. The Attorney General’s Office has since taken over the case, removing all clothes, shoes, and items, which have been displayed to the public in the hopes that they will be identified by the relatives of the missing. However, the outrage over the state’s handling of the investigation is overwhelming. So many missed opportunities. The ranch is now fully dug up, with excavations made in the ground to search for clues. In some of the holes, red flags indicate “positive” results, while in certain corners, there are mounds of ash. The ranch has been opened to the public, but information remains scarce or nonexistent. How many young men and women passed through there, how long ago, who survived, whose bones were found, what exactly happened there, and since when? There is nothing to report while the Prosecutor’s Office conducts its investigation, but it has already been made clear that the initial team responsible for gathering evidence failed, and the searchers fear that, once again, they’ll pass the buck and the case will be closed without any results. It is assumed that the brutal training camp was controlled by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which dominates the area, but even that remains uncertain. On the unpaved floor of one of the sheds lie rudimentary weights made from two rusty cans filled with cement. On the wall, there are other metal objects that also seemed to be intended for physical exercise. “They want them strong,” says a woman involved in the search, referring to the forced recruitment by criminal organizations. Beside her, a young woman wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the image of her missing loved one finds no solace, sitting on the cobblestones and embracing her friends from the bus. In Mexico, 124,000 people have been officially missing for several decades. The earliest cases were victims of the state itself, during what became known as the Dirty War, when the military and police took away people who opposed the regime. The missing people of today are victims of organized crime. Some voluntarily join their ranks, while others are abducted daily from neighborhoods, streets, and highways, never to be seen again. Some may be dead, but others may have endured the horrific indoctrination in these camps and turned into criminals themselves. All of them are being searched for by their mothers.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/khamenei-says-houthis-act-independently-warns-against-us-strikes-on-iran/,"Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said Friday that the Houthis, an Iran-aligned terror group that controls much of Yemen, act on their own motivations, after US President Donald Trump said he would hold Tehran accountable for the group’s actions. Khamenei also warned, “If the US or anyone else commits any malicious act against Iran, they will receive a severe blow,” in comments made in a televised speech, echoed by official social media posts. Trump said Monday that he would hold Iran responsible for any attacks carried out by the Houthis, as the American military carried out waves of strikes against the group, marking the biggest US military operation in the Middle East since he returned to the White House. The Houthis, whose slogan calls for “death to America, death to Israel, [and] a curse on the Jews,” have fired four missiles at Israel since Tuesday, all of which were intercepted, and none of which caused any casualties. The group resumed its attacks on Israel after fighting resumed in the Gaza Strip, amid the collapse of a hostage-ceasefire deal with the Hamas terror group. Americans, said Khamenei on Friday, “make a big mistake and call regional resistance centers Iranian proxies. What does proxy mean?” “The Yemeni nation has its own motivation and the resistance groups in the region have their own motivations. Iran doesn’t need proxies,” Khamenei said. The US “issue threats,” he added, but “we have never started a confrontation or conflict with anyone. However, if anyone acts with malice and initiates it, they will receive severe slaps.” Over the years, Iran has been aligned with groups across the region that describe themselves as the “Axis of Resistance” to Israel and US influence. Those groups include Hamas, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and various Shiite terror groups in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic Republic also counted the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad — ousted by Islamist rebels in December — as an ally. The Houthis began attacking ships in the Red Sea in November 2023, a month after Hamas stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza. While the Houthis have said they were attacking Israeli-linked shipping in support of Gaza, they have also targeted vessels with no known Israeli connections. The Iran-backed rebels also fired some 40 ballistic missiles at Israel, from November 2023 until just days before the Gaza hostage-ceasefire deal was reached in January 2025. They also launched several attack drones at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July. Responding to the attacks, Israel has carried out several strikes on Houthi sites in Yemen.","Khamenei says Houthis act independently, warns against US strikes on Iran","Agencies, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-03-21T12:02:39,2025-03-21T12:02:39,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-willing-to-temporarily-relocate-half-a-million-gazans-to-sinai-report/,"Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has informed other Arab leaders that he is willing to temporarily relocate half a million residents from Gaza to northern Sinai in a designated city as part of the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, according to a Friday report. According to the report in the Lebanese Al-Akhbar newspaper, Sissi made his willingness known during meetings held by Arab leaders in recent weeks in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. There was no confirmation of the report from any other source. The	Egyptian State Information Service denied the report, saying, “Egypt’s position is firm in its absolute and final rejection of any attempt to displace Palestinians, and the Cairo Arab Summit’s emergency plan for reconstruction is based on it.” In public statements, Sissi and Jordan’s King Abdullah have repeatedly rebuffed US President Donald Trump’s assertion that the two Arab countries could take in Palestinian refugees on a permanent basis under his plan to empty the Gaza Strip of its residents and turn it into a “riviera.” The issue is of crucial significance for Jordan and Egypt, which fear that an influx of Palestinians will destabilize their countries. Throughout the recent two-month ceasefire between Hamas and Israel — which collapsed this week — Arab leaders held several summits regarding Gaza and their vision for “the day after the war.” At an Arab League summit in Cairo in early March, Egypt presented its plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and emphasized that it would not include the displacement of residents. The Arab plan envisions an independent committee of technocrats governing Gaza for six months before handing control to the Palestinian Authority.	The plan does not mention Hamas by name, instead stating that the fate of all armed groups in Gaza can only be fully addressed through a political process that leads to a Palestinian state. According to previous reports in Arab media, the plan only includes the internal relocation of Gazans within Gaza to clear rubble and rebuild buildings and neighborhoods. According to a United Nations analysis from September, over two-thirds of Gaza’s structures have been damaged or destroyed during the war sparked on October 7, 2023, when Hamas rampaged through southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 hostages. Recently, the Trump administration has been sending mixed signals regarding its stance on the Egypt-led Arab plan for post-war Gaza. Initially, Trump spoke multiple times about his vision of emptying Gaza of its more than 2 million Palestinian residents and reconstructing the Strip, even suggesting that Israel would hand Gaza over to the US after the war. Then, on March 7, US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, called the Arab proposal a “good-faith first step” with “a lot of compelling features.” Hours later, however, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce characterized the proposal as “inadequate.” Last week, during a press conference with the Irish prime minister, Trump stated: “Nobody is expelling any Palestinians from Gaza.” Meanwhile, the Israeli government has been pushing the idea of a “Gaza exodus” as its plan for the Strip. At the beginning of the month, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that the government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, is working to establish a “migration administration” that will oversee the exodus of Palestinian residents from Gaza. “This plan is taking shape, with ongoing actions in coordination with the administration… It involves identifying key countries, understanding their interests — both with the US and with us — and fostering cooperation,” Smotrich said regarding the initiative and efforts to find countries willing to accept Palestinian emigrants.",Egypt willing to temporarily relocate half a million Gazans to Sinai – report,Nurit Yohanan,The Times of Israel,2025-03-21T08:38:44,2025-03-21T11:52:50,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250321009352315?section=national/diplomacy,"TOKYO, March 21 (Yonhap) -- South Korea and China agreed Friday to work together to restore cultural exchanges, raising expectations Beijing will lift its apparent restrictions on Korean entertainment and other content. The two countries reached the understanding during the bilateral talks between Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Tokyo, Seoul's foreign ministry said in a release following the talks. Friday's talks came as the two Asian neighbors are seeking to manage and improve their bilateral ties as key economic and regional partners despite differences in the security realm. ""The two ministers agreed to work together to ensure that the restoration of cultural exchanges between South Korea and China would enhance mutual understanding between their peoples, and serve as an opportunity to further develop practical cooperation between the two countries,"" the ministry said. Whether the issue of China's restrictions on Korean cultural content, such as K-pop and drama series, would be raised was a point of attention for Friday's talks. Beijing has never acknowledged the imposition officially, but South Korea believes that China placed the ban after Seoul's deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system in 2016. Expectations have grown recently over a possible easing of the measure, amid the two countries' efforts to improve bilateral relations. At the talks, Cho made it clear that South Korea's ""legitimate and lawful"" maritime rights should not be affected by China's activities in the Yellow Sea, the ministry said. Cho's remarks are seen as referring to last month's two-hour standoff between the two countries, when Chinese authorities blocked Seoul's attempt to investigate a steel structure China built in the overlapping waters in the Yellow Sea. Wang, in response, suggested continuing communication between the two sides ""with the recognition that mutual respect for maritime rights is important,"" according to Seoul's ministry. On the possibility of a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea, the two top diplomats agreed to work together to make his trip, if realized, an opportunity for a ""new turning point"" in bilateral relations. Xi is likely to visit South Korea for the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, due to take place in the southeastern city of Gyeongju between late October and early November. ""If President Xi visits, we hope to promote mutually beneficial and practical cooperation projects that will contribute to improving the livelihoods of people in both countries,"" Cho said in the opening remarks. They also agreed to closely cooperate to deepen economic cooperation, including expediting negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement in the service and investment sectors. Cho also asked for China to play a ""constructive role"" in addressing Korean Peninsula issues to encourage North Korea to halt its provocations and move toward denuclearization. The talks between Cho and Wang took place ahead of the planned trilateral meeting involving their Japanese counterpart, Takeshi Iwaya, set for Saturday. Cho arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day. He plans to meet Iwaya for separate bilateral talks following the three-way dialogue. Cho and Wang last held talks on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York in September last year. elly@yna.co.kr(END)","(2nd LD) S.

https://www.politico.eu/article/huawei-brussels-eu-parliament-lobbying-corruption-scandal-china/,"BRUSSELS — The European Union's lobbying scene is rushing to review its ties with Chinese tech company Huawei in the wake of a corruption scandal. European technology association DigitalEurope on Thursday suspended Huawei from its work after Belgian prosecutors last week launched an investigation into ""active corruption"" at the European Parliament benefitting the Chinese tech giant. The powerful industry group BusinessEurope also suspended Huawei as a partner company. Other EU lobby groups and think tanks that have Huawei as a member or received contributions from the company are considering steps too, they told POLITICO. The European Parliament and European Commission already blacklisted Huawei lobbyists last week, shutting off their access to EU premises, and commissioner cabinets and officials working at the EU executive's directorates general were instructed “to immediately suspend contacts and meetings"" with Huawei ""until further notice."" It’s a sign of how Huawei — which is among the top spenders of lobbying money in Brussels according to the EU's transparency register — is suffering major blows after Belgian police raided its main lobbying office in Brussels as part of a larger investigation into corruption, criminal organization and money laundering at the European Parliament.  DigitalEurope is one of Brussels' most powerful technology lobbying voices. It gathers tech companies and national industry associations to influence European Union decision making. The lobby group said in a statement it was aware of the “serious allegations” against Huawei. “We take ethical business conduct and compliance with the law very seriously. As a precautionary measure, Huawei’s membership has been suspended until further notice,” the statement read.  BusinessEurope is a lobbying heavyweight in Brussels, with a membership composed of national trade associations and representing the interests of industrial giants across all sectors. It has a group of ""partner companies"" that includes the world's largest companies. ""Considering the on-going exceptional developments, BusinessEurope has informed Huawei Technologies that its membership to [this] group would not be renewed and would be suspended with immediate effect dated last Friday, March 14 2025,"" the association said in a comment. Huawei is also a member of, or has contributed to, several other lobby groups, trade associations and think tanks, according to the EU's transparency register that lists declarations from organizations looking to lobby the EU's work. Those groups and associations are now all closely monitoring how the case unfolds or gearing up to take action.  The European Internet Forum, a non-profit led by European Parliament members, lists Huawei as a business member. Communications Manager Eusebiu Croitoru said the organization has scheduled a discussion about the investigation and “potential implications for Huawei’s membership,” which will take place April 9. The financial and ethical committee of the European Cyber Security Organization (ECSO) will “soon analyze the situation and possible next steps.” Think tank Bruegel said it is “closely monitoring the situation.” And the Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE) has kept the situation “under close review.” Several of the lobby groups or think tanks contacted by POLITICO said Huawei’s input to their organization or involvement in policy activities was small.  Huawei’s access to sensitive working groups at DigitalEurope was already limited following the security concerns raised over the Chinese tech giant in past years. The company’s contribution to CERRE was “clearly below” 10 percent of the think tank’s budget, it said.  Telecoms lobby group ECTA said that Huawei paid a discounted membership fee and assessed the involvement of Huawei in its activities as “limited,” but added it is “closely monitoring the situation.”  ECSO also said that Huawei had “limited rights” as an associate member. Eurelectric said Huawei is a “business associate,” which means the company is not involved in any policy work, but it added that it is following the reports “closely.” Elisa Braun and Mathieu Pollet contributed reporting.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250321004653315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, March 21 (Yonhap) -- Russia's Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu arrived in North Korea on Friday and was set to meet with leader Kim Jong-un, Russian and North Korean news outlets reported. Leading a delegation from Russia's Security Council, Shoigu arrived in Pyongyang and will meet with Kim and other North Korean officials, according to Tass and the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Kim Jong-gyu, Russian Ambassador Alexandr Matsegora and other officials greeted the delegation, which visited the Liberation Tower and laid a wreath, according to the North's state media. ""The participants paid a silent tribute to the memory of the fallen fighters of the Soviet Army before looking round the tower,"" the KCNA said. The visit marks the latest in a recent series of high-level exchanges between North Korea and Russia, which have grown closer, with Pyongyang deploying thousands of troops to support Moscow in its war against Ukraine. Earlier this month, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko traveled to Pyongyang, where he met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui and discussed arranging ""political contacts at the high and top levels,"" as previously reported by Tass. Appearing on Yonhap News TV in November, South Korea's National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik said the possibility of Kim visiting Russia cannot be ruled out, speculating that if the visit takes place, it could be in the form of reciprocation for Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to North Korea in June last year. At that time, Putin invited Kim to Moscow for summit talks. Russia's Victory Day holiday on May 9, which commemorates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in 1945, is widely speculated to be a potential occasion for Kim's visit to Russia as the country marks the 80th anniversary of its victory this year. The latest visit also comes amid U.S. attempts to broker a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, with U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin agreeing over the phone earlier this week on Russia's temporary halt to strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. During Putin's visit to Pyongyang last year, the two leaders signed a mutual defense treaty, elevating bilateral military cooperation and leading to North Korea's troop deployment to Russia. The deal has sparked international concerns that the two countries' military alignment could lead to Russia transferring rare missile and other high-tech arms technology to North Korea in return for its troop deployment. pbr@yna.co.kr",(3rd LD) Russia's top security official arrives in N.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-fires-shin-bet-chief-pm-claims-lack-of-trust-in-bar-who-calls-move-invalid/,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet voted unanimously in the early hours of Friday morning to dismiss Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, the premier’s office announced. Bar’s final day will be April 10, with the government moving up his dismissal after initially scheduling it for April 20, though Netanyahu’s office said Bar could be gone before then if ministers approve a permanent replacement. The move marked the first time in Israeli history that the government has fired the head of the domestic security agency. Netanyahu told the cabinet in a meeting that started late Thursday night that he lost faith in Bar after the October 7, 2023, Hamas assault on southern Israel. Bar is “soft” and “not the right person to rehabilitate the organization,” Netanyahu said, according to his office. “I have been managing diplomatic negotiations for many years,” continued Netanyahu. “He had a soft approach and was not aggressive enough.” He claimed that since replacing Bar on the negotiating team with another senior Shin Bet official, “the leaks have decreased dramatically, and through very successful negotiations we have managed to return the hostages.” The currently lapsed ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas was signed in January, weeks before Netanyahu removed Bar from the negotiating team, which has not secured the release of any additional hostages since then. As ministers deliberated, the Shin Bet circulated a letter Bar sent to the cabinet explaining why he wouldn’t attend the meeting and disputing the arguments ostensibly justifying his dismissal. He blasted the government’s “unfounded claims that are nothing more than a cover for completely different, extraneous and fundamentally invalid motives designed to disrupt the ability of the Shin Bet to fulfill its role.” He warned that Netanyahu was taking steps that weaken the country “both internally and against its enemies.” Saying that he and Netanyahu worked effectively to bring about January’s hostage release deal with Hamas and a series of operational successes on Israel’s southern and northern war fronts, Bar said there was no basis for the premier’s insistence that there is no trust between them, “except if the real intention, which I apparently failed to understand, was to negotiate without reaching a deal.” He added that Netanyahu’s decision to remove him and Mossad chief David Barnea from the hostage negotiations “harmed the team and did not advance the release at all.” Turning to “Qatargate” — what Bar called the “ongoing complex, extensive, and highly sensitive investigation currently underway into Qatar’s involvement in the heart of Israeli decision-making, the Prime Minister’s Office” — the Shin Bet chief said that completing the investigation in full was “a public duty of the highest order.” Dismissing the Shin Bet head during the investigation, Bar argued, was tainted with “extraneous considerations and a personal and institutional conflict of interest that could not be more serious.” It risked jeopardizing the investigation, he said, and called this a danger to the country’s security. He also pushed for a state commission of inquiry into October 7, a powerhouse probe led by a retired Supreme Court justice that Netanyahu has rejected: “The urgent national need for such an investigation cannot be subordinated to the personal considerations of those involved in the matter, as it is the only way to ensure that such a multi-system failure will not occur again,” Bar wrote. Bar also said the cabinet meeting was convened in contradiction of Israel’s laws and against the attorney general’s position. “My decision not to attend the government meeting stems solely from my understanding that this is a discussion that is not in accordance with the provisions of the law and the rules concerning the termination of the term of office of any employee, let alone one holding a senior position, and the position of head of the Shin Bet in particular,” he explained. “A substantive response to such claims requires an orderly process, including the presentation of relevant documents, and not a seemingly premeditated process whose outcome is predetermined,” said Bar. Conspiracy peddling Responding to Bar’s letter while the cabinet meeting was in progress, an “Israeli official” accused the spy chief of doing nothing to stop the Hamas October 7, 2023, attack even though, the official claimed, Bar knew it was going to happen beforehand. “Ronen Bar preferred not to attend the government meeting dealing with his case, simply because he was afraid of giving answers,” said the official, whom Channel 12 identified as Netanyahu himself, “and especially of answering one question — Why, after you knew about the Hamas attack many hours before it happened, did you do nothing and did not call the Prime Minister – something that would have prevented the disaster?” “If Ronen Bar carried out his role like he is now clinging on to his job, we would not have reached October 7,” the official charged. The official also accused Bar of “clinging to his seat while cynically exploiting the families of the hostages and using his position politically to fabricate futile, unfounded investigations.” Netanyahu has sought to shift the responsibility for the colossal failure onto the shoulders of the security establishment, arguing he was not woken up in the hours before the invasion when signs of impending attack were being picked up by Israel’s intelligence services, while denying he bought into the “conception” that Hamas was more interested in governing Gaza than attacking Israel. Netanyahu had for years placated the terror group with policies sending Qatari funds into Gaza, issuing work permits for Gazans and ordering limited responses to attacks. In their probes into the Hamas invasion, both the IDF and Shin Bet have acknowledged colossal failures surrounding October 7. The IDF’s investigations have established that it identified several signs of unusual Hamas activity the night before the terror group’s October 7 onslaught, but believed they did not indicate an imminent attack. The Shin Bet’s probe, only a summation of which has been published, acknowledged gaps in the “handling of information and integration of intelligence” as one of several factors contributing to the agency’s failure to issue an alert in the hours before the invasion. If the Shin Bet had acted differently, in the years leading up to the attack and during the night of the attack — both at the professional level and the managerial level — the massacre would have been avoided. This is not the standard we expected of ourselves, or that the public expected of us,” Bar wrote when the summation was released. The unfounded allegation that the military and security agencies had advance knowledge of the Hamas attack and deliberately ignored it, facilitating the Hamas massacre, has been peddled online, including by pro-Netanyahu conspiracy theorists, since soon after October 7, but not hitherto directly advanced by the prime minister. Fifty-one percent of Israelis oppose the firing of Bar, compared to 32% who back his dismissal, according to a Channel 12 opinion poll, published while the cabinet met. Forty-six percent say they trust Bar more than they trust Netanyahu, while 32% trust Netanyahu more than Bar. Unanimous vote, immediate petition “The main reason as to why I will vote in favor of removing the head of the Shin Bet from his position is his responsibility for the October 7th failure, a responsibility that he explicitly acknowledged,” said Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. He noted that many other senior defense and security officials have stepped down over the calamity, the worst attack in Israel’s history and deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, which Netanyahu and members of his government have refused to similarly resign over for failing to prevent. Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter of Likud, a former head of the Shin Bet, explained his vote to dismiss Bar by pointing to the importance of trust between the prime minister and the spymaster. “Unlike an institution that has operational aspects, the Shin Bet also has personal aspects related to the prime minister,” said Dichter, “The Shin Bet chief is responsible for the prime minister’s personal security.” “In a situation of a lack of confidence, there are two options: either the Shin Bet chief resigns, or he is fired. And if he does not resign, then he is fired.” National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, meanwhile, claimed Bar is a “direct threat to democracy,” according to Hebrew-language media reports. Ben Gvir, who has previously been convicted of incitement and supporting a terrorist organization, has long railed at Bar for warning about settler violence in the West Bank and the far-right minister’s actions on the flashpoint Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City. Minutes after the unanimous vote to fire Bar, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel said it had filed a High Court of Justice petition against the dismissal, which opposition figures panned even as ministers deliberated it. National Unity leader Benny Gantz said the decision to fire Bar was politically motivated and constituted a “mark of Cain on every government minister who raised his hand tonight, and will be remembered with eternal shame.” The Democrats leader Yair Golan said that Bar’s letter to the cabinet was “an unprecedented indictment.” Yisrael Beytenu party leader Avigdor Liberman tore into the government for voting to fire Bar “amid a war against all our enemies.” “The prime minister of October 7 [Benjamin Netanyahu] is doing exactly what our enemies dream of — fighting the Shin Bet head,” Liberman said. “[Netanyahu] needed to take responsibility after the disaster, resign first and demand all those to blame for the failure join him.” Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said the government was dismissing Bar “for one reason alone: To stop the Qatargate investigation.” “Opposition parties will together appeal this reckless step that is meant to whitewash a hostile state’s penetration into the prime minister’s office,” Lapid charged. Stormy demonstrations Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who was present for the vote and opposed the decision, had previously warned Netanyahu that he could not fire Bar before her office reviewed his motives for doing so, amid the Shin Bet investigation into the premier’s aides and their alleged ties to Qatar. The move to fire Bar, announced by Netanyahu on Sunday, sparked mass protests across the country, with critics fearing that the prime minister is seeking to replace Bar with a loyalist who will quash the Shin Bet’s ongoing Qatar probe, as well as politicize the government’s hold over the country’s security apparatuses. Thousands of people protested on Thursday night in front of Netanyahu’s office as the cabinet met. Appearing as a sea of umbrellas in the driving rain, the demonstrators marched from Netanyahu’s residence to the nearby office while chanting, “We will never give up,” capping off a day of protests that saw clashes with police who in some cases used water cannons on protesters. Some demonstrators protested by blocking the entrance to the Prime Minister’s Office with their cars ahead of the cabinet meeting. Footage showed policemen smashing the windows of the cars while passengers were inside to remove them. Netanyahu has insisted the investigation into the hundreds of thousands of dollars that his aides allegedly received from Qatar, which the attorney general ordered be opened last month, was politically motivated. Before the vote to fire Bar was scheduled, police on Wednesday evening detained and questioned two suspects in the case, who have not been named. Baharav-Miara, who the government is also moving to oust — with reports suggesting a vote to dismiss her could be held as early as Sunday — had said the premier could not fire Bar unless he consulted her and established a “factual and legal basis” for doing so. Netanyahu responded by accusing Baharav-Miara of “abusing her authority.” After Netanyahu’s office announced Thursday night’s vote, the government pushed off a previously scheduled cabinet meeting on the resumption of the Gaza war until next week. Although Bar has expressed his intention to eventually resign over his agency’s failure to anticipate the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack, he had been pushing back against the prime minister’s efforts to oust him, fearing that acquiescence would allow Netanyahu to appoint a loyalist in his stead. The Shin Bet head was reportedly planning to remain in his post until all the hostages were returned from Gaza and a state commission of inquiry was established to probe the failures surrounding October 7. According to a Channel 12 news report Wednesday, the leading candidates to replace Bar are the Shin Bet’s recently departed deputy chief, known only by his first initial “Mem,” and “Resh,” who was previously considered for the post. The network reported that former senior Shin Bet official Shalom Ben Hanan was also under consideration.","Cabinet fires Shin Bet chief; PM claims lack of trust in Bar, who calls move invalid",Lazar Berman,The Times of Israel,2025-03-21T01:39:35,2025-03-21T01:39:35,gemini-2.0-flash

(Yonhap) The DOE confirmed last week that the preceding Biden administration added South Korea to the SCL in early January -- a list that includes North Korea, China and Russia. The designation is set to take effect April 15. Officials of the designated countries are subject to stricter scrutiny when access is requested to DOE research institutions or other facilities for technology cooperation or other purposes. The designation has drawn keen media attention in Seoul as many Koreans apparently view the juxtaposition of their country alongside North Korea, China and Russia in the SCL as a matter of trust in the long-standing alliance with the U.S. Asked if there is a chance that South Korea will be taken out from the list before April 15, Ahn said that he needs to examine exactly what is going on with regards to the list during planned talks with U.S. officials. He also elaborated on what alternative Seoul is considering. ""The U.S. side is talking about procedural issues (regarding the listing),"" he said. ""We are trying to find an alternative that can make sure that those procedural matters would not become impediments (to bilateral cooperation) as much as possible."" He pointed out the U.S. government's position that there is no serious problem in bilateral science and technology cooperation. Another focus of his trip is on President Donald Trump's plan to roll out ""reciprocal"" tariffs on April 2, which will be customized on a country-by-country basis based on countries' tariff- and non-tariff barriers and other factors, including exchange rates. ""There have been virtually no tariffs between the two countries under a bilateral free trade agreement. But there are various non-tariff issues being raised. Efforts are underway to swiftly address part of them domestically (in Korea),"" he said. ""During my visit this time, I will explain these matters, and we are in communication with them over with what plans we will resolve issues where the U.S. has concerns."" Asked whether South Korea is in the so-called Dirty-15 group of countries, Ahn refused to ""prejudge."" This week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent mentioned Dirty-15 countries with high tariffs on U.S. goods, but he did not elaborate. ""We have been consulting steadily. We are now in a situation where we need to craft a framework to minimize any negative impact on South Korean industrial sectors,"" he said. sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)",Industry minister vows utmost efforts to remove S.

https://apnews.com/article/eu-defense-funds-weapons-ukraine-ammunition-russia-d472d36e583f1bd7ebf54e5826b9e752,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin’s key peace demand that Western allies stop providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine is quietly being ignored by the European Union. As U.S.-led talks with Russia and Ukraine progress, without the Europeans at the table, the 27-nation bloc is pressing ahead with a steel “porcupine strategy” aimed at building the Ukrainian armed forces, and the country’s defense industry, into an even more formidable opponent. At an EU summit on Thursday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that it’s “central” that Ukraine should remain an independent democratic nation that can continue its journey toward EU membership and “that it also has a strong army of its own after a peace agreement.” “For us, it will be important to continue to support Ukraine significantly — as the European Union as a whole, as allies and friends and as individual countries,” Scholz told reporters in Brussels. A few hours after he spoke, Scholz’s EU counterparts — with the exception of Hungary, which opposes the bloc’s “peace through strength” stance — called on member countries “to urgently step up efforts to address Ukraine’s pressing military and defence needs.” Mindful of Russian deception in the past — the “little green men” who annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, or the troop buildup in 2021 that Moscow denied would lead to any invasion — the Europeans are deeply skeptical about Putin’s intentions and whether he would accept any peace terms. With the U.K. and other partners, some European countries are working on a deterrence force to police any future peace. At the same time, Ukraine’s best security guarantee, apart from the NATO membership that the U.S. refuses, is that its own army is strong and well supplied. In a defense blueprint unveiled on Wednesday, the European Commission set out how it plans to meet Ukraine’s security needs, with EU money available to help bolster its defense industry, which produces arms and ammunition more cheaply and closer to the battlefield. “Ukraine is currently the front line of European defense, resisting a war of aggression driven by the single greatest threat to our common security,” the document says. “The outcome of that war will be a determinative factor in our collective future for decades ahead.” At the heart of the EU’s strategy is a commitment to provide air defense systems and missiles — including long-range precision warheads. In groups, countries would jointly purchase the equipment and financially back Ukraine’s own effort to obtain them. Drones are a major advantage on the battlefield, and the EU intends to back Ukraine’s procurement of them and help it build its own production capacity, including through joint ventures between European and Ukrainian industries. Another aim is to provide at least 2 million rounds of large-caliber artillery shells each year, and to continue a training effort that has helped to prepare more than 75,000 Ukrainian troops so far. In return, European troops will learn from Ukraine’s front-line experience. Ukraine would also be able to take part in the EU’s space program, with access to the services provided by national governments in the area of global positioning, navigation, surveillance and communications. Financially, and beyond the estimated 138 billion euros ($150 billion) already provided to Ukraine, the government in Kyiv would be able to secure cheap loans for defense purposes — as can EU countries and Norway — from a new fund worth 150 billion euros ($162 billion). ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at ",EU presses on with steel 'porcupine strategy' for Ukraine as Russia tries to end Western support,Lorne Cook,AP News,2025-03-20T14:13:19,2025-03-20T19:21:04,gemini-2.0-flash

The test-firing was conducted by the country's Missile Administration on Thursday to ""examine the comprehensive performance"" of the missile system being mass-produced at a munitions' industry enterprise, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) noted. Kim oversaw the test alongside key members of the party's Central Military Commission, the KCNA said, claiming that it proved the missile's combat fast response is ""advantageous"" and ""highly reliable."" Photos released alongside the report showed what appeared to be a launched missile hitting a target and exploding, and Kim smiled contentedly apparently at the test result. Kim said the country's army will be equipped with ""another major defense weapons system with laudable combat performance,"" expressing gratitude to the research group in charge and relevant munitions industry enterprise for strengthening national defense capability, the KCNA said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgz8jlxlk3o,"The potential Western troop deployment to Ukraine being discussed in London should be described as a ""reassurance force"" rather than a ""peacekeeping force"", defence and diplomatic sources say. Currently dubbed the Multinational Force Ukraine or MFU, it would be sent to the country to cement any ceasefire and encourage long-term confidence in the country. The focus would be on providing Ukraine with air cover to keep its skies safe and a naval presence in the Black Sea to encourage trade. The deployment of so-called ""boots on the ground"" - probably about 20,000 strong - would in terms of size not be big enough to enforce any peace. Instead, the troops - provided by a so-called ""coalition of the willing"" - would most likely be deployed to protect cities, ports and major energy infrastructure. One option being considered is that the MFU might not operate in the east of Ukraine near the front line to try to reassure Russia it poses no offensive threat. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin have said repeatedly they would not agree any ceasefire if European and other forces were deployed to Ukraine. The sources say any multinational operation in Ukraine would not be a ""peacekeeping force"" and should not be described as such. Peacekeeping forces - under the aegis of either the United Nations or Nato - traditionally are impartial, operate with the consent of both parties and use force only to defend themselves. The multinational force being discussed would very much be on Ukraine's side, there to help deter future Russian aggression. At the moment, it is not expected that the multinational force on the ground would monitor any ceasefire. That would be done by Ukrainian troops on the frontline and Western surveillance assets in the air and space. The sources also say the coalition troops would not be deployed to provide a so-called ""tripwire force"" - meaning a force smaller than that of the opponent, designed to deter an attack without triggering escalation - if Russia resumed its invasion of Ukraine. They say the military impact of any allied deployment of about 20,000 troops would be limited compared to the number of troops on either side of the front line. Ukraine has almost a million military personnel, Russia's army is even larger. Much of the focus of Thursday's discussions is on how best any international force can provide Ukraine with assets it does not have, especially capability in the air. So, there will be discussions about which countries can provide warplanes to keep Ukraine's skies safe during a ceasefire. There will also be discussions about how to make the Black Sea safe for shipping. That may involve two components: how best to keep shipping lanes clear of mines and what kind of naval task force could provide a security presence in the sea. The key uncertainty is whether the United States would provide any air, satellite or intelligence cover for any European force on the ground. The US has thus far said it would not be willing to provide any military ""backstop"". The European strategy for now is to stop asking the US and instead organise the best force and capability it can to ensure the security of Ukraine in the future. Once the details are agreed, then the UK, France and others would see if the European offer was substantial enough for the US to have a change of heart and agree to play some kind of role. What all this planning depends on, of course, is some kind of ceasefire being agreed in Ukraine. While the US remains optimistic, many in Ukraine remain sceptical that Russia even wants to end the fighting. Intelligence suggests that drones could be used to inflict harm to vital infrastructure. The deal sets up an investment fund to search for minerals, and set outs how revenues would be split. The White House has been pushing for the agreement as a prerequisite for further military assistance. A minister says nearly all key details have been finalised for a deal giving the US access to the country's minerals. The announcement comes after North Korea confirmed for the first time its soldiers are fighting alongside Russia. Copyright 2025 BBC.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250320002451315?sec,"SEOUL, March 20 (Yonhap) -- Prosecutors on Thursday raided Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon's office and residence over allegations of corruption surrounding his ties with self-proclaimed power broker Myung Tae-kyun. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office sent prosecutors and investigators to Oh's office at Seoul City Hall and his residence in the morning to search for possible evidence linked to the allegations. They also raided the residence of Kang Cheol-won, the city's former deputy mayor for public affairs. The prosecution has been looking into the suspicion that Kim Han-jung, a businessman known to be a supporter of Oh, asked the Future Korea Research Institute, a polling company effectively operated by Myung, to conduct 13 unpublished opinion polls during the 2021 Seoul mayoral by-election campaign and paid 33 million won (US$22,650) in polling costs on behalf of the Seoul mayor. Kim allegedly sent the money to the personal account of Kang Hye-kyung, who served as deputy head of the polling company, on five occasions between February and March 2021. The Seoul prosecution has so far summoned Kim and Oh's aides, including Kang, for questioning over the alleged connection with Myung after taking over the case about a month ago from the Changwon District Prosecutors Office in the southeastern city of Changwon, where Myung and the polling company are based. Myung has alleged that he met Oh seven times and had a three-way meeting involving Kim and he played an important role in Oh's election win at that time. Oh and Kim have both denied the allegations. Oh, who filed a complaint with the prosecution against the broker late last year, accusing him of fraud, said he met Myung twice in January 2021 but severed ties with him later.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250319008600320?section=economy-finance/economy,"SEOUL, March 20 (Yonhap) -- The industry ministry on Thursday launched a rare metals industry development council to better respond to the intensification of protectionism and discuss the supply chain strategies of the domestic industry, according to officials. During its inaugural meeting held in Osong, 107 kilometers southeast of Seoul, members agreed to conduct a comprehensive review of the supply chain and technological landscape for 15 critical rare metals, including rare earth elements, lithium and tungsten, which are essential for advanced industries. Given the diverse applications of rare metals across industries, the council comprises experts from industry, academia and research institutions. The council plans to assess Seoul's rare metals supply chain, analyze related technologies and develop strategies to navigate global rare metals markets and export controls in the future. odissy@yna.co.kr(END)",Gov't launches rare metals industry development council,Chang Dong-woo,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-20T06:00:05,2025-03-20T06:00:05,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/major-protests-in-jerusalem-as-government-seeks-to-fire-shin-bet-chief-renews-gaza-war/?utm_source=article_hpsidebar&utm_medium=desktop_site&utm_campaign=liveblog-march-19-2025,"Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched into Jerusalem on Wednesday morning in a renewed outburst of rage against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, over efforts to remove key security and judicial officials and renew highly controversial legislation to increase political power over the judiciary, and following the collapse of the Gaza ceasefire. At least 12 protesters were arrested during Wednesday’s rally and at protests that continued into the night, with policing clashed with demonstrators and employing watercannons to break up the crowds. A taxi driver ran over a protester, injuring him, and was later arrested after fleeing the scene. The major protests came as the government seeks to oust Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, two officials who have drawn the ire of Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition in recent months. Outrage over preparations to sack the two, coupled with the resumption of fighting in Gaza that has left the fate of remaining hostages uncertain, prompted greater impetus and support for the anti-government protests. In the morning, police blocked the main highway leading into the capital to traffic as protesters waving Israeli flags and yellow banners set out from Motza, on Jerusalem’s western outskirts. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories “It’s time to end this madness before we don’t have anyone to save, before we don’t have a country left,” protest leader Shikma Bressler told the crowd before entering the city. The protesters gathered outside the Knesset around noon, then proceeded to Netanyahu’s home, on Azza Street in Jerusalem’s Rehavia neighborhood. Activists leading the march held a large banner that read: “Enough of the government of destruction,” as the large crowds proceeded down Ben Zvi Boulevard, which police also closed to traffic. Hundreds of others further up the road sat on the pavement while chanting for a deal to free the remaining hostages in Gaza, and in support of the top officials the government plans to oust. “It happened to Ron Arad, it could happen to all of us,” they chanted, referring to the Israeli Air Force officer long presumed dead following his 1986 capture in Lebanon and subsequent disappearance. Many protesters held signs with slogans calling for an end to the war, while a handful carried signs calling on reservists to refuse to serve in the military, as an act of defiance against Netanyahu’s government. During a speech outside Netanyahu’s private home, protest leader Moshe Radman seemed to compare the government to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and other bitter enemies of the Jewish people. “We got through Haman, we got through Pharaoh, we got through the British Mandate, we got through Hitler… we’ll get through them too,” he said through a megaphone to the applause of other demonstrators. According to the Ynet news site, Radman later attempted to soften his remarks, saying: “We don’t want a strand of hair to fall from Netanyahu’s head, we only wish for him to get booted from the government and sit in jail until his very last day.” At the top of the street, near Netanyahu’s official residence, a group of silent protesters sat in the middle of Paris Square, blocking the intersection	 to traffic. Jerusalem police said in the afternoon that they had arrested four people, including one armed counter-protester who threatened to harm demonstrators. “Over the course of the protest, dozens of participants began to disrupt the public order,” a law enforcement spokesman said, adding that many attempted to break through crowd control barriers. Some protesters also used their cars to block main streets in the capital without police authorization, in what the spokesman called “a blatant violation of the protest conditions agreed upon in advance between protesters and Israel Police in recent days.” He noted that police were planning to tow the vehicles. The protests continued into the late evening, with demonstrators lighting bonfires on Azza Street and clashing with police. Footage from the street showed The Democrats MK Gilad Kariv being forcibly shoved away by cops, which the left-wing opposition party decried as “crossing a red line.”
               “This is what a dictatorship looks like,” it said in a tweet. “This isn’t law enforcement. This is trampling of democracy. We won’t shut up and won’t give in.” After nightfall, a taxi driver rammed into a protester in what looked to be an intentional attack. The incident left the protester, Oded Rotem, momentarily unconscious with a minor injury to his leg. According to eyewitnesses, the car dragged Rotem for 50 meters (160 feet) on Herzog Street. Rotem was hospitalized. The driver fled the scene and was later apprehended by police. The Democrats party chairman Yair Golan accused Netanyahu’s government of inciting violence, calling the incident “a terrorist attack,” in a post on X, assering	that the “violence against patriotic protesters is a direct result of the hatred, lies, and incitement emanating directly from the Israeli government.” Anti-government protesters gather around a bonfire on Azza Street in Jerusalem, near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence, on March 19, 2025. (Gilad Furst Protest Movement) Earlier in the day, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid called on people to go out and demonstrate, calling Netanyahu’s government “illegitimate.” “We are taking to the streets because the Israeli government has lost its legitimacy,” Lapid declared in a recorded message. “We will not break the law, we will continue to serve, but we will stand firm against a government that is trying to dismantle the country.” Gantz clashes with demonstrator Outside the Knesset, one angry demonstrator got into a heated confrontation with National Unity chairman Benny Gantz, who had gone out to greet the protesters in a show of support. “Get out of here, you disgrace, you betrayed us!” he shouted at the politician, apparently accusing Gantz of not doing enought to fight the government. That prompted a heated shouting match during which the two were physically separated by security, as Gantz shouted back: “For 40 years I fought for the country, and you call me a betrayer?” Following the incident, Gantz tweeted that most protesters are “Israeli patriots who care about the country,” but that “an unrepresentative handful of arsonists who hate Netanyahu more than they love the country.” Gantz’s use of the term “arsonists” garnered criticism from politicians to his left, including Democrats party chairman Yair Golan, who countered that “the protesters who took to the streets today are the greatest lovers of Israel I have ever met.” In a statement hitting back at Golan, National Unity accused the opposition politician of “distorting Gantz’s words, who emphasized the importance of the demonstration and the fact that most of the demonstrators were Israeli patriots.”","Major protests in Jerusalem as Netanyahu seeks to fire Shin Bet chief, renews Gaza war",Charlie Summers,The Times of Israel,2025-03-19T15:10:19,2025-03-19T18:26:20,gemini-2.0-flash

https://katu.com/news/local/state-emergency-declared-as-storms-cause-fatal-flooding-landslides-in-southern-oregon,"PORTLAND, Ore. (KATU) — Gov. Tina Kotek has declared a state of emergency over to deadly flooding and landslides in Southern Oregon. The declaration was made due to the damage caused by ongoing storms that have impacted the state since Feb. 24. Those storms have led to significant flooding and landslides across the state and resulted in at least one fatality, according to state officials. READ MORE: Storm brings flooding, landslides to SW Oregon; one person drowns in floodwaters The emergency declaration allows responders to use all necessary and appropriate resources in disaster response. The Oregon Department of Transportation is out doing repairs on roadways, clearing debris, and shoring up hillsides to prevent further landslides. ""Early estimates for repairs for damaged two roads are about $10 million,"" said ODOT spokesperson Julie Denny. ""It is an early estimate and we expect after assessing more that that will change."" Denny said ODOT crews still have quite a lot of work to do, and they will seek federal reimbursement for damages that occurred during the emergency. “When emergencies hit, Oregon families and businesses need to know we have their back in every part of the state,” Kotek said in a press release. The declaration includes Clackamas, Coos, Curry, Douglas, Harney, Jackson, Josephine, Lane, Multnomah, and Malheur counties. ""It got to the point where we couldn't get our car or truck out it was too deep,"" said Ron Heaton of Sutherlin. “Recovery starts as soon as disaster strikes, and this declaration will help get Oregonians back to normal as soon as possible. I urge everyone to follow the instructions and evacuation levels issued by emergency officials, subscribe emergency alerts on ORAlert.gov, have an evacuation plan, prepare a go-kit, and stay aware of changing conditions,” she added. The Oregon Department of Emergency Management activated the State Emergency Coordination Center to Level 3 on March 17. That means the state is coordinating closely with local, Tribal, and state partners to share information and support local response and recovery operations as needed, officials said. Tap here to learn more about current conditions and impacts from the storms. There's another system moving in to the region, and some areas that haven't recovered might see more damage.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c204290er1ro,"Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa has told the BBC he wants US, European and Brazilian armies to join his ""war"" against criminal gangs. He added he wants US President Donald Trump to designate Ecuadorean gangs as terrorist groups, as he has done for some Mexican and Venezuelan cartels. He also said Ecuadorean law would be respected when asked about his recent partnership with Erik Prince, an ally of Trump and founder of controversial private military firm Blackwater. Violence has soared in Ecuador in recent years, with gangs battling to control drug trafficking routes. Most of the world's cocaine is trafficked through Ecuador's ports. President Noboa has previously indicated he would like foreign military aid to help tackle drug cartels – but this is the first time he has singled out the US, Brazil and Europe. Security – and how he is dealing with it – is a top issue for voters ahead of a run-off vote in Ecuador's presidential election on 13 April. Noboa has defined his 16 months in office through a tough crackdown on gangs and militarising the streets and prisons – however he has also come under fire from critics who see his tactics as too heavy-handed. During his term, the murder rate decreased by approximately 16% from 2023 to 2024 but it remains far higher than previous years, and in January 2025 killings hit a record 781 in one month. In an interview with BBC News, the incumbent president said: ""We need to have more soldiers to fight this war."" ""Seventy per cent of the world's cocaine exits via Ecuador. We need the help of international forces."" He said what started as ""criminal gangs"" are now ""international narco-terrorist"" groups of 14,000 armed individuals. Donald Trump's decision to designate some Latin American cartels as terrorist groups has given US law enforcement further powers to fight them. Noboa told the BBC he wants his US counterpart to do the same with Ecuadorean gangs: ""I would be glad if he considers Los Lobos, Los Choneros, Los Tiguerones as terrorist groups because that's what they really are."" Noboa has already ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with ""allied nations"" to support Ecuador's police and army, and is also seeking parliamentary approval to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in Ecuador again. As well as constitutional changes, it would require other nations to be willing to offer this. Deploying armies abroad can be risky and expensive but there is some precedent for it. The US had a military base for its anti-narcotic operations in Ecuador until 2009, before these were banned by former President Rafael Correa. President Noboa's challenge will be convincing figures like Donald Trump in the US, or leaders in Europe where many drugs are shipped to, that it is in their interests too to stop cartels and drug trafficking. On the alliance with Trump ally Erik Prince, which he announced a few days ago, he said: ""We're fighting an unconventional, urban guerilla war. He has the experience. He's advising our armed forces, our police."" Mr Prince founded the private military firm Blackwater that has provided security services to US governments but has also been embroiled in controversy. He sold the company in 2010. Four Blackwater contractors were convicted and jailed for killing 14 Iraqi citizens in Baghdad's Nisour Square in 2007 and were later pardoned by Trump in 2020. Does President Noboa want Mr Prince to bring mercenaries to the country? ""Not necessarily mercenaries,"" he said. ""We are talking about armies. US, European, Brazilian special forces. This could be a great help for us."" While some supported the move, some Ecuadoreans cited Mr Prince's past record and feared rights abuses in the country. When asked about some of Erik Prince's past controversies, Mr Noboa said Ecuador's laws must be respected and warfare conducted legally. But, he added, cartels had ""violated every single human right possible for the last five years"". ""They've mutilated people. They've raped thousands of women. They've trafficked human organs. They've traded illegal gold. And moved more than 1,000 tonnes of cocaine a year."" Last year, his iron-fist approach came under fire after four boys were arrested by soldiers over an alleged theft and later found mutilated and burned. Noboa said those soldiers were in jail pending an investigation but that he would ""fight until the end"" to convict those responsible. He maintained the armed forces were acting proportionately in tackling crime and noted an imbalance between his 35,000-strong military and 40,000 armed gang members. With the record number of killings in January, leading critics argue his strict approach is failing. During a campaign rally, his left-wing challenger Luisa González said: ""The campaign promises made in 2023 were to be delivered in a year and a half. Not two. Not three. Did he deliver? No!"" Noboa said it was normal to see rising violence before elections in his country, but reiterated that Ecuador could not fight this problem alone: ""This is a transnational crime without a transnational security policy."" While Albanian, Mexican and Colombian cartels worked together, there was not a joint security policy among countries affected by drug violence, he said. Ecuador needs help, he argued, because its economy is smaller than many in Europe or the US where most drugs are shipped to. He added drug trafficking and illegal mining generated $30bn (£23bn) – around 27% of GDP – annually in Ecuador. He urged countries where consumption of cocaine is high, like the UK, to do more to tackle this arguing: ""The product they're consuming has a chain of violence and misery."" Violence and post-pandemic unemployment have driven many Ecuadoreans to flee northward. They are now one of the top nationalities crossing the dangerous Darien Gap jungle from South to North America. President Noboa is willing to take back Ecuadorean migrants from the US, but not other nationalities, and said the country was giving returnees technical training and a minimum wage for three months. For him, the solution is improving ""opportunities"". ""We need to develop, as an export-based economy, jobs in Ecuador for these people."" While he said he ""100%"" empathised with people fleeing violence, he blamed a past ""lack of strong security policy"". His message to Ecuadoreans now? ""Stay - and you'll see positive results. We're reducing inflation. Companies are hiring. The economy is recovering."" Daniel Noboa will face Luisa González in the run-off vote next month. He received only 0.5% more votes than her in the first round, suggesting the second round could be very close and polarising. With security the top issue for voters, his success – or not – may depend on whether Ecuadoreans think progress has been good enough.","US and European armies should join our war on gangs, Ecuador president tells BBC",Ione Wells,BBC News,2025-03-18T21:05:59,2025-03-18T21:05:59,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-19-2025-88abc5eb7cd137adb01bbd8a86ca6503,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel said Wednesday its troops retook part of a corridor that bisects Gaza, and its defense minister warned that attacks would intensify until Hamas frees dozens of hostages and gives up control of the territory. The military said it had retaken part of the Netzarim Corridor that divides northern Gaza from the south, and from where it had previously withdrawn as part of a ceasefire that began in January. That truce was shattered Tuesday by Israeli airstrikes that killed more than 400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The advances on the ground by Israel on Wednesday — which included sending more troops to southern Gaza — threatened to drag the sides into all-out war again. The ceasefire had given war-weary Palestinians some respite, allowed a much-needed surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza — and led to the release of dozens of hostages who had been held for more than 15 months. Early Thursday, a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace, the military said. Air raid sirens and several explosions were heard in Jerusalem, apparently the sounds of the interceptors in use. No injuries were reported. Yemen’s Houthi rebels did not immediately claim the attack Thursday morning. Within Israel, the resumption of airstrikes and ground maneuvers in Gaza has raised concerns about the fate of roughly two dozen hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive. Thousands of Israelis took part in anti-government demonstrations in Jerusalem, with many calling for a deal to bring the captives home. A Hamas spokesman, Abdel-Latif al-Qanou, said the moves by ground forces in Gaza was a clear sign that Israel had backed out of the truce and was reimposing a “blockade.” There have been no reports of rocket attacks by Hamas since Tuesday’s bombardment. Also Wednesday, the United Nations said one of its employees was killed in Gaza and five others were wounded in an apparent strike on a guesthouse. It was not immediately clear who was behind the strike, the U.N. said. The military said its “limited ground operation” in Gaza would create a “partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza.” It wasn’t immediately clear whether the move would entirely block Palestinians from traveling north or south through the Netzarim Corridor. Israel used the roughly 4-mile (6-kilometer) corridor as a military zone during the war. It ran from the Israeli border to the coast, just south of Gaza City, the territory’s largest metropolitan area. Israel said airstrikes on Wednesday hit dozens of militants and militant sites, including the command center of a Hamas battalion. It denied Palestinian claims that it hit the U.N. guesthouse. Fares Awad, an official in the Gaza Health Ministry, said an Israeli strike on a gathering of mourners in the northern town of Beit Lahiya killed 17 and wounded 30. The Israeli military had no immediate comment.  Until Israel withdrew from Netzarim in January, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who had fled northern Gaza for the south were prevented from returning throughout the war. Many of them have since returned. But Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, said the military would soon order Palestinians to evacuate from combat zones. Katz said Tuesday’s aerial bombardment “was just the first step” in Israel’s plan to ratchet up the pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and give up control of Gaza. Until it does, Israel will attack “with an intensity that you have not known.”  Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the U.N. Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike in the central city of Deir al-Balah. He said the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity.  He did not provide the nationalities of those killed and wounded.  Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike. “Israel knew this was a U.N. premise, that people were living, staying and working there,” he said. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said the explosion was not caused by Israeli fire. After the strike Wednesday, the wounded were rushed to Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital in central city of Deir al-Balah. One man was carried inside on a blanket held up by medical workers. Another lay on a hospital bed, his knee bandaged.  In southern Lebanon, a U.N. peacekeeper was wounded after stepping on a mine. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said the incident took place during “operational activity” by the peacekeeping mission known as UNIFIL in the village of Zibqin, adding that the injuries are not life-threatening. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 436 people, including 183 children and 94 women, have been killed since Israel launched the strikes early Tuesday. It said another 678 people have been wounded. The military says it only strikes militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.  The war has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. The Health Ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children. The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals; 59 hostages remain, and more than half are believed to be dead. Before this week’s attacks, Israel and Hamas were set to negotiate an extension of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, which lasted six weeks.  But those talk never got off the ground. Hamas has demanded that Israel stick to the terms of the initial ceasefire deal, including a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. Israel, which has vowed to defeat Hamas, has put forward a new proposal that would extend the truce and free more hostages held by Hamas, without a commitment to end the war. The breakdown of the ceasefire was met with anger in Israel, where many support the plight of the hostage families to free their loved ones. Israel’s return to a military campaign came as Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests taking place over his handling of the hostage crisis and his plan to fire the head of Israel’s internal security agency. Demonstrators massed around Israel’s parliament on Wednesday and later marched near Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem, where police sprayed water to try to clear them. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem and Magdy from Cairo. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at ",Israeli troops advance in Gaza to retake part of a corridor dividing north from south,"Wafaa Shurafa, Julia Frankel, Samy Magdy",AP News,2025-03-19T13:28:18,2025-03-19T22:27:16,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-thailand-and-us-air-forces-hold-exercise-to-enhance-readiness-cooperation,"SINGAPORE – The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is taking part in a large-scale air exercise with the air forces of Thailand and the United States to enhance its combat readiness and operational capabilities.

The RSAF said on March 18 that it has  26  aircraft,  10  ground-based air defence systems and more than 700 personnel participating in the 31st edition of  Exercise Cope Tiger .

The first phase of the trilateral exercise – a command post exercise – was held on  Dec 17 to 19, 2024 , at the Multinational Operations and Exercise Centre at Changi Naval Base.

The second phase – a flying training exercise at Korat Air Base and Chandy Range in Thailand – began on  March 17  and would end on  March 28 .

Exercise participants are also taking part in a two-day socio-civic programme to engage the local communities and schools around Korat Air Base and Chandy Range.

Colonel  Benjamin  Lee Yew Chern, RSAF’s exercise director, said Exercise Cope Tiger “allows us to execute air defence, strike and UAV operations to enhance our combat readiness and operational capabilities”.

“The longstanding nature of the exercise is also a testament to the strong defence relationship and cooperation among the three participating countries,” he added.

The closing ceremony will be held on March 28.

It will be co-officiated by Singapore’s Chief of Air Force, Major-General Kelvin Fan; Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Air Force, Air Chief Marshal Punpakdee Pattanakul; and the US Commander of Fifth Air Force, Pacific Air Forces, Lieutenant-General Stephen F. Jost.

Since it began in 1994, Exercise Cope Tiger has been enhancing the professionalism and defence relations between Singapore, Thailand and the US, and promoting closer rapport and mutual understanding among their personnel, said Mindef.

The Bangladesh transitional government expressed distress about remarks by the US intelligence chief that the religious minorities situation in Bangladesh is concerning.
Tulsi Gabbard has managed to “paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush,” the media wing of transitional government head Muhammad Yunus said in a statement late Monday.
That was after Gabbard told Indian broadcaster NDTV World that the “persecution and killing” of religious minorities in Bangladesh and “the threat of Islamic terrorists” is “rooted” in the “ideology and objective” to “rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate.""
Bangladesh said Gabbard's comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations.
Calling it misleading and damaging to the image of the country, the statement said Bangladesh has a traditional practice of Islam. It said the country has been famously inclusive and peaceful, and has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism.
Groundlessly linking Bangladesh to the idea of an ""Islamist caliphate” undermines the hard work of countless Bangladeshis and their friends and partners around the world who are committed to peace, stability, and progress, it said.
The statement encouraged political leaders and public figures to base their comments, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes to fan fears and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions.
The comments came at a moment when Bangladesh and India have been witnessing a bitter exchange of words and border tension since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, known for her friendly relations with India, fled to India last Aug. 5 in a popular uprising.
Since the changeover, India continued to allege that minorities, particularly Hindus, are the victims of violence due to the changes in Bangladesh.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi complained to US President Trump in a recent visit to the US, that minorities in Bangladesh were being targeted.
The Yunus government, however, ruled out India’s complaints as fabricated and hate campaigns against Bangladesh.
Bangladesh finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed, talking to reporters Tuesday said that Gabbard's remarks will not affect bilateral or multilateral relations between Bangladesh and the US, and will have no effect on Bangladesh’s economy.",Dhaka slams US spy chief’s 'misleading' comments about Bangladesh,Sm Najmus Sakib,Anadolu Agency,2025-03-18T00:00:00,2025-03-18T00:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250319000900320,"SEOUL, March 19 (Yonhap) -- South Korea will take measures to prevent the circumvention of antidumping duties on imported steel products as part of efforts to protect the local steel industry amid heightened global trade barriers, the industry ministry said Wednesday. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced the plan at a meeting of economy-related ministers, presided over by acting President Choi Sang-mok, according to ministry officials. The plan comes after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on all steel imports last week, a move expected to deal a blow to the South Korean steel industry. To prevent trade circumvention, the government plans to revise its customs regulation to allow the Korea Trade Commission (KTC) to investigate circumvention of antidumping duties by rerouting products through a third country. The government will also require a mill test certificate, which contains detailed information on the product's country of origin, for all steel imports. Additionally, a special team will be created under the Korea Customs Service to crack down on the practice of disguising imported goods as domestically produced products for domestic distribution or exports. The ministry said it will also work to exempt duties on Korean steel products by closely communicating with the governments of major economies, including the U.S., through various trade channels. The government will also respond to the planned imposition of carbon levies by the European Union (EU) under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the EU's push to strengthen its trade safeguard measures, as well as India's safeguard investigation of steel imports, the ministry added. The ministry plans to devise a strategy to bolster the competitiveness of the local steel industry later this year to overcome the crisis sparked by the global trade war. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)",S.

Per Article 31 of the National Defense Act (å	cbé	88²æ³	95), the ministry must submit the QDR to the Legislative Yuan within 10 months of the presidential inauguration. Like the 2021 QDR, the new quadrennial report focuses on building strong defenses and multilayered deterrence. .Photo: Screen grab from the Ministry of National Defenseâ	fs Web site The strategy would take advantage of Taiwanâ	fs terrain to bolster the militaryâ	fs â	cadaptability, agility, lethality, cost-effectiveness and stealth,â	fd the QDR said. The nation would build combat capability across land, sea, air and cyberspace to deter aggression, the QDR said. During wartime, the ministry would rapidly mobilize, enact multiple layers of defense and lean on military-civilian integration to delay enemy actions, weaken any invading forces and force a retreat, it said. Photo: Tu Chien-jung, Taipei Times Future budget increases would focus on enhancing asymmetric capabilities and strengthening countermeasures to â	cgray zoneâ	fd threats, the QDR said. To raise the total defense budget to President William Laiâ	fs (è³´æ¸	85å¾	81) target of more than 3 percent of GDP, the ministry would prioritize a special defense budget, it added. The latest report included a separate chapter dedicated to â	clinking regionally to strengthen collective deterrence,â	fd with the chapterâ	fs first section dedicated to â	cdeepening military exchanges between Taiwan and the US.â	fd The US is an important strategic partner, engages in close military exchanges and assists the nation in developing its self-defense capabilities, it said. The ministry will continue to promote strategic cooperation with the US to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, it added. As for cooperation plans, the ministry would expand and deepen cooperation through strategic national security dialogues and visits, joint military exercises, defense industry cooperation and intelligence sharing, it said. In other developments, the ministry yesterday confirmed that this yearâ	fs three-phase Han Kuang exercises began last month, with phases two and three to take place next month and in July. According to a ministry report delivered to the legislatureâ	fs Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, this yearâ	fs drills would be focused on Chinaâ	fs â	cgray zoneâ	fd tactics and the possibility of a Chinese invasion in 2027. Military officers held a closed-door sandbox simulation last month, in which the joint chiefs of staff and other high-ranking military personnel reviewed this yearâ	fs joint combat plans, which have been amended based on changes made to counter information warfare, to include the whole-of-society defense resilience concept, and the issue of reservist forces, the report said. The next session, which is to run from April 5 to 18, would use the Joint Theater Level Simulation systems to help commanders across all levels to test the validity of their plans and strategies, and how to work better with their own staff, it said. The final results of the second stage are to be implemented in the live exercises from July 7 to 18, with all commanding officers encouraged to develop strategies that consider possible actions from enemy forces, it said. The exercises, at different stages, expect to set the rules of engagement, implement decentralization of command, review weapon and equipment efficacy in combat situations, general logistics support, and how well the military and civilian sectors are integrated, it said. The exercises hope to address strategies involving joint task force efforts to lock down enemy forces, implement defensive mine-laying, spread out munition supplies and logistics, test the efficacy of newly acquired weapons, and gauge how well civilian and military arms integrate with each other, the report said. MORE VISITORS:The Tourism Administration said that it is seeing positive prospects in its efforts to expand the tourism market in North America and Europe Taiwan has been ranked as the cheapest place in the world to travel to this year, based on a list recommended by NerdWallet. The San Francisco-based personal finance company said that Taiwan topped the list of 16 nations it chose for budget travelers because US tourists do not need visas and travelers can easily have a good meal for less than US$10. A bus ride in Taipei costs just under US$0.50, while subway rides start at US$0.60, the firm said, adding that public transportation in Taiwan is easy to navigate.

https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/03/18/eu-to-tighten-controls-on-steel-imports-and-waste-metal-flows-amid-trade-tensions,"The European Commission is set to seek stricter controls over imports of steel and aluminium due to fears of diverted global supplies being dumped onto its markets, according to a draft paper seen by Euronews. It also aims to restrict countries from closing themselves off to waste metal imports, according to the paper. The Commission is set to present its final action plan on steel and metalsÂ
present on Wednesday, providing guidelines on how to make European metal production more sustainable and competitive amid trade tensions with the USÂ
and fierce global competition. The text makes clear that the EU executive is expecting overcapacity to worsen the trade situation in the steel markets after existing safeguard measures expire on 30 June 2026.Â
""Instead, the problem may worsen as more countries restrict imports, making the EU a key destination for surplus steel,"" according to the draft. For this reason â

by the third quarter of 2025 at the latest, the Commission will propose a long-term measure providing an equivalent level of protection to the EUâ

s steel sector,â

the document reads. â

â

The timing of the proposal will ensure that the new measure will be in force in time to replace the current safeguard and provide the same degree of defence against negative trade-related effects caused by global overcapacities and to base this approach on a combination of tariff quotas, taking account of security and resilience considerations, as well as of changes in EU demand, while maintaining a certain level of openness of the EU market,â

the document adds. The European Commission will also launch an investigation for possible safeguard measures for the aluminium sector, since the combination of a loss of substantial market share of EU producers and the recent US tariff on aluminium are â

likely to worsen the situation further with a significant threat of trade diversion from multiple destinationsâ

, the paper says. The document also specified that existing export restrictions imposed by third countries on exports of waste metals should be countered with reciprocal measures.

https://apnews.com/article/canada-carney-arctic-circle-greenland-d44e557453bc402a8c4e617041e262b0,"IQALUIT, Nunavut (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday announced a radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada’s far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region. The prime minister’s office said the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) Over-the-Horizon Radar system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic. Carney announced the purchase at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut on his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there. “Arctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,” Carney said. ““Canada is, and forever will be, an Arctic nation.” The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up. “This will be a significant export if this deal is finalized,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.   Albanese had a phone call with Carney the prior night.  “Obviously, there are issues taking place, particularly between Canada and the United States, I wouldn’t have expected to have been happening in my lifetime,” Albanese said.   Senior Canadian government officials, who briefed reporters on Carney’s plane before the announcement, said the purchase has been well received by top military officials in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian military command that overseas threats over the two countries.   But the officials said they couldn’t say how the Australian purchase would be received politically by Washington. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.  Carney also announced the government will spend Canadian $420 million ($294 million) to expand Canada’s Arctic operations and training exercises and deploy more personnel. He said Canada will have a “greater sustained year-round presence.” The prime minister’s flight path took him over Greenland. U.S. President Donald Trump’s interest in Greenland, northeast of Nunavut, comes as part of an aggressively “America First” foreign policy platform that has included threats to take control of the Panama Canal and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. “The United States priorities, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,” Carney said.  Trump has threatened economic coercion to make Canada the 51st state. His constant talk of annexation has infuriated Canadians and turned around the political fortunes of the governing Liberal party, which was headed for a historic defeat but now has a chance of winning a fourth term. Carney is expected to call a general election by the end of the week.  The president is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products and has already placed them on steel and aluminum.   Carney and Trump have not spoken since Carney was elected as the new Liberal party leader and prime minister more than a week ago. Carney said at the “appropriate time” he will have a discussion with the U.S. president, as “two sovereign nations, that is comprehensive and not targeted at one issue.” But Trump keeps disrespecting Canada, saying twice on Fox News on Tuesday night that that “Canada was meant to be the 51st state.” He said that’s why he’s he’s tougher on his neighbor than America’s biggest adversaries. Trump also repeated several times that he didn’t care that the Liberals might win the Canadian election now.  “The Conservative that’s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don’t know, but he said negative things,” Trump said. “So, when he says negative things, I couldn’t care less. I think it’s easier to deal actually with a Liberal. And maybe they’re going to win, but I don’t really care. It doesn’t matter to me at all.” Carney visited Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.  For much of the year, the weather in Iqaluit can be severe. In February 2010, Iqaluit hosted a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations. Several of the dignitaries, including Carney when he was head of Canada’s central bank, went dogsledding in subfreezing temperatures. It is a distinctive destination — home to about 7,500 people but not a single traffic light — with no road or rail links to the outside world. Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put the Arctic at the heart of the debate over global trade and security.",Canada's new leader announces $4.2 billion Australian radar purchase,Rob Gillies,AP News,2025-03-18T15:27:04,2025-03-18T22:49:33,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/peru-state-of-emergency-violence-singer-death-f2a2addd25f983dec817fda0a25062cf,"LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru’s president declared a state of emergency in the capital Monday and ordered the deployment of soldiers to help police address a surge of violence, amid widespread outcry a day after the killing of a popular singer. President Dina Boluarte’s government published a decree saying that the state of emergency will last 30 days, and authorities will restrict some rights, including the freedom of assembly and movement. That means the police and the army would be able to detain people without a judicial order. Peru has seen an increase of killings, violent extortion and attacks on public places in recent months. Police reported 459 killings from Jan. 1 to March 16, and 1,909 extortion reports in January alone. But outrage crested after the killing Sunday of Paul Flores, the 39-year-old lead singer of the cumbia band Armonia 10. In Congress, opposition lawmakers requested a vote of no confidence against Interior Minister Juan José Santiváñez for what they say is a lack of a plan to fight rising violence. The vote is expected to be discussed in the Congress’ plenary later this week. Flores was shot to death early Sunday when assailants attacked the bus he and bandmates were traveling after a concert in Lima. Cumbia is a Latin music style that people dance to the rhythm of drums, maracas and other instruments. The attack against the popular singer was not the only violent event over the weekend. On Saturday, an object exploded at a restaurant in the capital, injuring at least 11 people. Boluarte’s government previously decreed a state of emergency in an attempt to stem the violence between September and December.",Peru declares emergency and deploys army,,AP News,2025-03-18T00:11:07,2025-03-18T16:34:29,gemini-2.0-flash

Ahn plans to hold a face-to-face meeting with Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, scheduled to visit Seoul for two days from Monday, according to the sources familiar with the matter. In the planned meeting, the two sides are expected to discuss Seoul's potential investment in the Donald Trump administration's Alaska liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, aimed at building a nearly 1,200-kilometer gas pipeline from Alaska's vast North Slope to its southern port in Nikiski. Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun (L) speaks at a meeting with local steel industry officials in Seoul on March 13, 2025. (Yonhap) South Korea has been considering taking part in the project as part of apparent efforts to negotiate on new U.S. tariffs. Earlier this month, Trump openly welcomed Seoul's potential participation in the project, along with Tokyo. Japan and South Korea are respectively the world's second- and third-largest LNG importers. Seoul's offer to join the Alaska project came as it is considered a prominent bargaining chip for South Korea, which has been facing mounting pressure to sharply reduce its trade surplus with the United States in order to avoid the U.S.' new ""reciprocal"" tariffs. Industry watchers say the project could open new opportunities for the South Korean steel, shipbuilding and construction industries as the gas pipeline construction requires advanced technologies, in which Korean companies enjoy a competitive edge. But since the project could be a burden on Korean companies, the government has said it will closely assess the economic feasibility and the risks of the project before making a decision. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)",Industry minister to meet Alaska governor next week to discuss gas pipeline project: sources,Kim Na-young,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-18T08:57:40,2025-03-18T08:57:40,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/pm-idf-launching-strikes-throughout-gaza-after-hamas-refused-repeated-hostage-deal-offers/,"The IDF is launching strikes throughout Gaza after receiving orders from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz to “act forcefully” against Hamas amid the terror group’s refusal to release Israeli hostages, the premier’s office says. The IDF attacks appear to mark a return to the Israeli military campaign against Hamas that was halted with the start of a ceasefire on January 19, though the statement from the Prime Minister’s Office does not explicitly say this. “At the direction of the political echelon, the IDF and Shin Bet are extensively attacking Hamas terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip,” the IDF and Shin Bet say in a subsequent joint statement, adding that additional details will be provided shortly. Netanyahu’s office says Hamas “rejected all offers it received” from US special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff and the other mediators. Hamas has insisted on sticking with the original terms of the deal, which was supposed to enter its second phase at the beginning of the month. That phase envisioned Israel fully withdrawing from Gaza and agreeing to permanently end the war in exchange for the release of the remaining living hostages. While Israel signed on to the deal, Netanyahu has long insisted that Israel will not end the war until Hamas’s governing and military capabilities have been destroyed. Accordingly, Israel refused to even hold talks regarding the terms of phase two, which were supposed to begin on February 3. Nonetheless, the ceasefire had been remaining in place for roughly two and a half weeks after the conclusion of the first phase, as mediators worked to broker new terms for the truce’s extension. Accepting Israel’s aversion to phase two, Witkoff presented a bridge proposal last week that would have seen phase one extended for several weeks during which five living hostages would be released. The US envoy said Sunday that Hamas’s response to the offer was a “non-starter” and warned of impending consequences if the terror group did not change its approach. In its statement announcing the overnight strike, Netanyahu’s office says they are aimed at achieving Israel’s war aims, which are the dismantlement of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities and the return of the hostages. Hostage families have long argued that those aims contradict each other and that a return to fighting will endanger their loved ones. “From now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military force,” Netanyahu’s office says, adding that the plans for the resumption of IDF operations were approved last week by the political echelon.",PM: IDF launching strikes throughout Gaza after Hamas refused repeated hostage deal offers,Jacob Magid,The Times of Israel,2025-03-18T00:40:28,2025-03-18T00:23:51,gemini-2.0-flash
https://buenosairesherald.com/business/industry/industricide-argentine-companies-warn-of-tariff-cuts-taxes-and-exchange-rate,"Despite the economic rebound projected for this year, job creation expectations in Argentina’s industrial sector remain bleak. According to data from the INDEC statistics bureau, one in four companies plans to reduce its workforce within the next sixty days. The government is deepening the exchange rate lag while accelerating trade liberalization. Meanwhile, companies — alert to high taxes — warn that an “explosive mix” is forming for national production. The industry barely has time to process one piece of bad news before the next arrives. After the heavy blow of the recession in the first half of 2024, a sharp process of deregulation and trade liberalization followed. Then, the exchange rate began to appreciate, and tariff reductions were introduced. Everything is moving in the same direction — more difficulties producing in Argentina. “A fixed exchange rate, no tax cuts, and tariff reductions — it’s a collective execution,” stated the owner of an industrial company with multiple factories in the country that employs over 600 people. The combination described by the entrepreneur, who requested anonymity, is becoming even more pronounced. Inflation accelerated again in February, jumping to 2.4%, just as the government decided to slow the pace of official exchange rate devaluation. Over the weekend, Economy Minister Luis Caputo announced another round of tariff cuts. The industrial sector criticizes the order of events, arguing that import taxes are being cut first, making for an uneven playing field. Tariff Reductions “In the coming days, we will publish a decree in the Official Gazette to lower tariffs on clothing and footwear from 35% to 20%, on fabrics from 26% to 18%, and on various yarns from 18% to 12%, 14%, and 16%,” Caputo announced on his X account. The Argentine Chamber of the Apparel Industry and the Argentine Apparel Federation responded with a strongly-worded statement: “The tariff reductions announced by the national government will destroy thousands of jobs and domestic companies.” They continued: “The government must first fulfill its promises to lower taxes, reduce payroll costs, stop abusive lawsuits, cut high financial costs, and lift currency controls.”  “Without doing that first, this measure is industrial suicide,” they concluded. Next Monday, the Textile Chamber of Mar del Plata will hold a press conference, warning that the measure will have a severe impact on the city. The textile value chain employs 520,000 people nationwide. Employment Employment is emerging as one of the most sensitive variables in the coming months. According to an INDEC survey, 27% of industrial companies plan to cut jobs in the next 60 days. Only 7% expect to hire new employees, while 60% plan to keep their workforce unchanged. Sources from the Argentine Association of Metalworking Industrialists explained that in February, the sector experienced a 1.8% year-on-year decline and a slight 0.3% contraction compared with January. “While some sectors show signs of recovery, the overall trend continues to indicate difficulties in job creation,” they stated. Expectations in this regard are also not optimistic: 72% of companies plan to maintain or reduce their workforce, while only 28% anticipate a slight increase in employment. “This suggests that the sector’s recovery still faces significant challenges,” the association reported. Small businesses and the government’s theory The situation worsens when focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises. Mauro González, president of the Federal SME Confederation, provided some figures: “Nearly 15,000 companies closed in the past year, and about 100,000 jobs were lost nationwide.” Looking ahead, he agreed that employment prospects are negative. “It has already become clear that Argentina’s production of goods and services has shrunk, and this will directly impact employment,” he said. Despite the global debate on the relocation of production cycles, the government downplays the destruction of industrial jobs, arguing that jobs lost in one sector will be created in another. However, this premise has yet to be confirmed in practice: according to official data, more than 119,000 registered private-sector jobs have been lost so far.

“Raising sails and sailing the impetuous waves, the ancestors of the Chinese nation opened the Maritime Silk Road between the East and the West more than 2,000 years ago,” Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his speech in Lima.

It was around 7 p.m. on November 14, 2024. Sitting next to his Peruvian counterpart, Dina Boluarte, Xi added that, more than 500 years ago, the Incas had “managed to build the great road that crossed the Andes Mountains from North to South.”

In Chancay, some 80 kilometers from the Peruvian capital, dozens of Chinese and Peruvian officials followed his words via videoconference as they lined up in front of giant blue containers bearing the Cosco Shipping brand.

“Today, the port of Chancay becomes the starting point of the great Inca road of a new era, from Chancay to Shanghai,” Xi said. With those words, he inaugurated the Chancay Multipurpose Port Terminal.

Experts say the port is expected to become a regional hub that will consolidate trade between Asia and South America.

According to economist Jorge Vega, professor at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica del PerÃº (PUCP), this is due to the port’s “location, size, modern technology, and contact with global shipping networks.” The travel time between South America and China will fall from 36 days to 24 days.

A brief history

It was 2007 when former Peruvian Navy commander Juan Ribaudo de la Torre suggested that the Chancay Bay, with its depth of almost 18 meters, was perfectly suited for building a port capable of receiving large commercial vessels. He created the Chancay Ports Company, and, in 2011, the project attracted the attention of the mining company Volcan, which acquired 50% of the shares.

After Ribaudo’s death in 2013, the mining company took over 100% of the project and began work in 2016. However, development of the project required an investment that exceeded their means, and they sought a partner.

In 2019, Cosco Shipping Ports joined the project, acquiring 60% of the shares. The Chinese state-owned company is part of the Ocean Alliance, a strategic commercial alliance within the Belt and Road initiative — China’s strategy to bolster its trade routes.

Construction of the port began in 2020, which foresees a total investment of US$3.4 billion. Last November, the first stage was inaugurated. Featuring four docks, an administrative complex, logistical services, and a tunnel almost two kilometers long, the initial stage cost US$1.32 billion.

According to Cosco, the group envisions the construction of a total of 15 docks in four stages, which will be operational by 2032. The megaport will also be an automated facility, with autonomous cranes, unmanned electric vehicles, and, according to the company, all of it will be carbon-free.

According to the Peruvian Central Reserve Bank, the port’s contribution to the economy will be 0.3% of GDP in this first phase, and that figure is expected to reach 0.9% by 2025.

Regional impact

For internationalist Óscar Vidarte, “the port of Chancay will completely change the shipping dynamics of the South Pacific,” although he noted that “there is a lot of fear, especially in Chile, because the construction will affect local ports.”

“Ships from Chile and Peru normally travel as far as Mexico or the United States before their contents are loaded onto larger vessels in order to cross the Pacific,” he said.

“Trade of Chilean exports to China will speed up,” the PUCP professor explained. “This is fundamental for fruits and all edible products.”

Vidarte likewise added that Chancay could improve the connection routes between Peru and Brazil, but that it will depend on whether the South American giant is interested in crossing the Amazon to reach the Peruvian coast or prefers instead to keep its shipping route in the Atlantic.

In May 2024, Brazil and China inaugurated a new trade route linking Carioca ports with the city of Tianjin, 170 kilometers from Beijing. The shipping company managing this route will be Cosco Shipping as well.

“Is there an economic justification for spending so much money on a railroad linking Peru and Brazil, with the port of Chancay as a departure point? I believe that now, because before there was no port,” said Vidarte.

However, specialists warn that before such a construction can be considered, Peru must first solve its infrastructure problems. For Vega, the government “is behind in providing adequate roads or railways,” as well as in the urban improvement and expansion of Chancay.

The PUCP professor also indicated that public and private projects are being developed for expansion and new roads on the Pan-American Highway, which connects Chancay with the rest of the country. “But all this will take time to materialize and will not be ready before May,” which is when the trial period will end and full operations will begin.

The United States weighs in

In an interview with Bloomberg four days after the inauguration, Mauricio Claver-Carone stated that any product going through Chancay, or any other Chinese-owned or controlled port in the region, should be “subject to a 60% tariff.”

“As if the product were from China,” added Cardona, who at the time was advisor to Donald Trump’s transition team. In January, he was chosen as the State Department’s new special envoy for Latin America.

Also in November, General Laura J. Richardson, former head of the U.S. Defense Department’s Southern Command, told the Financial Times that the port could host Chinese naval warships in the future, potentially turning it into a strategic point for Beijing’s plans of military expansion.

Is the Chinese presence in Chancay a threat to the United States?

For Vidarte, its crucial that we look at the full picture because there is “a lot of exaggeration.” “Claver-Carone talks about taxes, but the goods from Chancay are not meant for the United States because the port’s goal is to connect with the Asia-Pacific [region],” he said.

However, he acknowledged that the U.S. is concerned not only by Chinese economic influence. He pointed to the fact that Washington considers that the port of Chancay can be a “geostrategic port” in a scenario of “greater confrontation with China.”

“The port has been built for commercial purposes. There are neither norms nor legal considerations that say it will be used for other purposes. But [the U.S.] fears that, when the time comes, it will be used for that.”

The international relations scholar admits that, because of this situation, the Peruvian government is playing a “balancing” role. This was particularly on display during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) last November.

“On the one hand, Chancay was inaugurated while, on the other, an agreement was signed granting the United States a space port in Talara,” he recalled. The initiative is part of an agreement with NASA aimed at “boosting research and development of advanced technologies.”

The two countries will invest close to US$268 million in the project set to be located in a city just four degrees below the Equator. According to Peruvian Air Force commander Carlos Chávez, this offers an “enormous advantage” to space and suborbital vehicles.

Vidarte considers that the agreement is “no small thing” because, for the United States, space is not only a matter of research but also of “security.”

“Peru always has to find a balance in order to not be seen as either too Chinese or too American. A middle ground is quite difficult, but it’s a fine line that is still possible. I don’t know for how long.”

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8ywlk8n4yo,"People living in Mekelle, the main city in Ethiopia's war-scarred Tigray, have told the BBC they fear they could soon be dragged into conflict again. Growing tensions threaten the fragile peace agreement signed in late 2022, which brought an end to a brutal civil war that claimed an estimated half a million lives. Many here are preparing for the worst - either leaving for the federal capital, Addis Ababa, on sold-out flights, or stocking up on emergency supplies and withdrawing their savings from the bank. ""It's all because of the anxiety,"" one resident said. Tseganesh Kassa, an ex-combatant from Shire, a city in central Tigray, badly wounded her leg during the war. She now walks on crutches and requires regular medical treatment. She says war ""rocked my family"". ""I am now a disabled person and my family has been [ruined] economically. I don't want to see that again. Displaced people living in makeshift camps haven't even been returned to their homes. ""No-one can handle another [war]."" Tigray was the epicentre of the conflict. The guns were silenced when two of the main warring groups, Ethiopia's federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the leading political party in the region, signed a peace agreement. This led to the formation of an interim administration tasked with running the region until elections were held. But in recent months there has been a growing power struggle between senior figures within TPLF and Tigray's interim administration. The administration accuses certain TPLF politicians of attempting to seize power by force. Some within the TPLF accuse the interim administration's leadership of failing to support ex-fighters or bring back people displaced by the war. Territories that were once under Tigray's administration before the fighting but are now are under others' control is also a hot issue. Both sides accuse each other of engaging in treasonous activities that involve ""external actors"". There are now concerns the peace agreement could unravel, and even fears over the prospect of a direct conflict between Ethiopia and its neighbour Eritrea. During the Tigray war, Ethiopia's government was supported by Eritrea. But relations have deteriorated between the two countries since the peace deal, which Eritrea did not sign. Since then, there seems to be a feeling in Eritrea that it has become the fall guy for the atrocities reportedly committed during the war. All parties were accused of gross abuses during the civil war - including the mass killing of civilians and widespread sexual violence. Eritrean soldiers were particularly accused of being behind the deaths dozens of the civilians in the historic city of Aksum. Tigray's interim administration says Eritrean troops are still occupying parts of the region's land along shared borders where they continue to commit abuses. Meanwhile Eritrea's information minister called the allegations ""fabricated"" adding the areas in question are ""Eritrean sovereign territories"". Tigrayan officials want the return of these and other disputed areas currently under the control of forces from neighbouring Amhara region, as outlined in the peace deal. Ethiopia's ambitions to have access to the sea is another factor souring relations with Eritrea. There are fears that the two neighbours could return to war six years after they mended their fraught relations. If violence returns to Tigray - or if clashes break out between Ethiopia and Eritrea - the implications will far reaching in an already volatile region. In Mekelle, residents are weary of the prospect of further conflict. ""The youths are tired of violence,"" Tesfay Gebreabgzi, a shoe-shiner in his 20s, tells the BBC. ""During the [civil] war, lots of people had the desire to fight. Now there's only fatigue."" Haimanot Gebremariam, a vegetable vendor in her 50s, says her two children joined the fighting on the Tigrayan side after war broke out in 2020. But while her daughter returned safely, her son sustained permanent wounds. She says she does not want to see a return to ""the dark days"". The situation now ""is very concerning"", she tells the BBC. ""We still live with the trauma and the scar of the previous war. We don't want to shed tears again."" The Tigray region has not fully recovered from the disastrous impact of the conflict. Nearly a million displaced people have still not returned home and some key infrastructure — including schools and health facilities - have not yet been rebuilt. Nonetheless, despite the palpable anxiety, there is a semblance of normality in Mekelle. Businesses and shops are working regularly. And there is not a heavy presence of security forces on the streets. But having lived through one of Africa's deadliest conflicts in recent memory, many are closely following every small development. In one coffee house, young people are glued to their phones, watching clips from recent press statements made by the head of Tigray's interim administration, Getachew Reda, who is currently hundreds of miles away in Addis Ababa for ""consultations"" with federal authorities. In another cafe, a young man said he was waiting to hear what the city's new mayor - who was appointed on Thursday by the dissident TPLF faction - would do to calm the public. Everyone, it seems, is waiting to see what the next days and weeks will bring.",'No-one can handle another war' - Tigrayans fear fresh Ethiopian conflict,Kalkidan Yibeltal,BBC News,2025-03-17T21:55:09,2025-03-17T21:55:09,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-doubles-down-on-syria-aid-despite-outbreak-of-violence/,"European Union countries will continue to back Syria’s new leadership through both financial aid and sanctions relief despite an outbreak of sectarian violence threatening the country’s stability, the bloc’s foreign ministers said Monday. Germany led the charge by pledging €300 million in support for food, health and other essential services for Syria’s population, as the EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas said the bloc will continue to lift sanctions against Syria. “As Europeans, we stand together for the people of Syria, for a free and peaceful Syria,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock added ahead of an annual donor conference for Syria in Brussels. In a lightning revolution late last year, Syrian rebels — led by former al-Qaeda commander Ahmed al-Sharaa — overthrew Bashar Assad’s decades-long dictatorship, ushering in a fragile new system of governance in a country wracked by religious and ethnic rivalries. In recent days, gunmen from the Alawite Islamic minority, affiliated with Assad, targeted Syrian security personnel, sparking retaliatory and extrajudicial killings by forces allied with al-Sharaa’s new government. Thousands of Alawites have since fled, including to neighboring Lebanon, while hundreds of Alawite civilians have also been killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Kallas insisted the bloc needed to double down on its support for Syrian, while striking a note of caution. “The violence outbreak is really worrying,” she said. “It shows that hope in Syria is really hanging by a thread. This shows that we need to do more to really show that Syria is going in the right direction,” she added. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani is joining the aid conference in Brussels, along with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Kallas and EU foreign ministers. A senior EU official said last week they hoped additional funding would help Syria “turn a page” on 14 years of civil war, amid concerns that a freeze on international aid from the United States could worsen the situation on the ground. The EU has spearheaded efforts to restore diplomatic ties with Syria in recent months, including by lifting sanctions originally imposed against Assad’s regime, with several leaders pushing to send Syrian migrants who lack legal status in Europe back to their home country.",‘Hope in Syria is really hanging by a thread’: EU pledges more aid despite violence,Nicholas Vinocur,POLITICO,2025-03-17T12:10:43,2025-03-17T12:10:53,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/india-new-zealand-free-trade-deal-a3c1515d7b6b07e79fa460f9ef9ee35c,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his New Zealand counterpart, Christopher Luxon, met Monday seeking to deepen their defense and economic ties, a day after the countries announced the revival of negotiations for a free trade agreement. Modi and Luxon met in New Delhi and signed agreements on enhancing cooperation in defense, food processing, pharmaceuticals, renewable energy and critical minerals. Luxon said he held “highly productive meetings” with Modi and other Indian leaders that will improve ties between India and New Zealand. The defense relationship includes joint military training, he said. “New Zealand is committed to doing more with India across a wide range of areas — defense and security, trade and economics, people-to-people ties, education, tourism, sports and culture,” Luxon said at joint press conference with Modi. Luxon was accompanied by business leaders and several parliamentarians on his five-day visit to India. India and New Zealand on Sunday agreed to revive free trade negotiations that have been stalled for more than 10 years. The announcement was made after discussions between New Zealand Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay and his Indian counterpart, Piyush Goyal. It follows India’s recent efforts to broker trade deal agreements with other nations after U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from countries including India. India and the European Union last month agreed to finalize a long-pending free trade agreement by the end of this year. A similar trade deal between India and the United Kingdom is also in the works. India’s Commerce Ministry said the free trade deal between India and New Zealand aims to “achieve balanced outcomes that enhance supply-chain integration and improve market access.” It did not offer other details. Luxon in a statement Sunday said: “It is through trade that we can boost the economies of both our countries, providing more jobs and higher incomes for Kiwis and Indians.” The bilateral trade between India and New Zealand stood at $1.7 billion in 2023-24 financial year. ____ This story corrects bilateral trade figures.",India and New Zealand look to bolster ties after reviving free trade talks,,AP News,2025-03-17T09:05:56,2025-03-17T05:04:42,gemini-2.0-flash

Overall, at least 40 deaths have been recorded from the cross-country storm system. At least 40 people in seven states have died amid the severe weather outbreak, officials said Sunday.

The premier summoned Bar for an urgent meeting in his office on Sunday evening, Netanyahu’s office said, and informed him that the cabinet would vote for his dismissal later in the week. “At all times, but especially during an existential war such as the one we face, there must be full trust between the prime minister and the head of the Shin Bet,” Netanyahu said in a video statement following his meeting with Bar. “But unfortunately, the situation is the opposite — I do not have such trust. I have ongoing distrust in the head of the Shin Bet, a distrust that has grown over time.” “I want to make clear,” stressed the prime minister, “I am full of appreciation for the men and women of the Shin Bet.” He added that he was “sure that this step is critical for the rehabilitation of the agency, for achieving all our war aims, and for preventing the next disaster.” While Hebrew media reported that a vote on Bar’s dismissal would take place in a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara told Netanyahu later on Sunday night that he could not “initiate a dismissal process” of Bar “until the factual and legal basis underlying your decision is fully examined, as well as your authority to address the matter at this time.” She explained that the reason for this was “the extraordinary sensitivity of the issue, its unprecedented nature, the concern that the process may be tainted by illegality and conflict of interest, and considering that the role of the head of the Shin Bet is not a personal trust position serving the prime minister.” It was not the first time that the attorney general has warned as much. Earlier this month, one of her deputies published a missive stressing that, in the event that the prime minister seeks to dismiss the head of a security body, the move must be reviewed by the attorney general, “in order to ensure its compliance with the necessary procedural and substantive safeguards.” Responding to the attorney general, Justice Minister Yariv Levin argued that “The Shin Bet Law explicitly states that the government has the authority to terminate the service of the head of the agency before the end of their term. This law should be known to the attorney general.” Levin added: “In case anyone is confused, Israel is a democracy, and everyone in it, including the attorney general, is subject to the law.” He said the government “must not surrender to threats or attempts to strip [it] of its authority.” Bar was appointed chief of the Shin Bet in 2021 by then-prime minister Naftali Bennett for a five-year term, but the government has the authority to end his tenure and appoint a new director. In the history of the State of Israel, no Shin Bet director has ever been fired, though two directors resigned before completing their terms. Netanyahu was widely reported to have been working for months to try and oust Bar, as he seeks to pin the blame for the failures surrounding the October 7, 2023, onslaught on the security services, while exonerating his own government. Although Bar intended to eventually resign over his agency’s failure to anticipate the attack, he was said to be pushing back against the effort to oust him, fearing that acquiescence would allow Netanyahu to appoint a loyalist in his stead. He was reportedly planning to remain in his post until all the hostages were returned from Gaza and a state commission of inquiry established to probe the failures surrounding October 7. Demand for ‘personal loyalty’ In a lengthy statement following Netanyahu’s announcement, Bar charged that the decision to fire him was unrelated to the agency’s failures surrounding the October 7 attack, but rather due to a personal issue. “The duty of loyalty placed on the Shin Bet is first and foremost to Israeli citizens. This underlies all my actions and decisions,” Bar said. “The prime minister’s expectation of a duty of personal loyalty, the purpose of which contradicts the public interest, is a fundamentally illegitimate expectation. It is contrary to the Shin Bet law and contrary to the patriotic values that guide the Shin Bet and its members,” he added. Bar noted that the Shin Bet’s internal review of the failures that led to October 7 “pointed to a policy led by the government, and the person who has headed it, for years, with emphasis on the year preceding the massacre. The investigation showed a longstanding and deliberate disregard by the political echelon for the agency’s warnings.” He said he intended to continue in his role until the hostages are returned, until he completes several “sensitive” investigations — likely those related to the Prime Minister’s Office — and until his two potential successors are ready. After some media outlets took that part of the statement to mean Bar was refusing to step down, the Shin Bet clarified that Bar will accept his dismissal if the decision is passed. “As someone who headed the Shin Bet on October 7, I took responsibility for the agency’s part and clearly stated that I intend to act on it before the end of my tenure. That is what is expected of everyone.” Bar said in his statement. “Therefore, it is clear that the intention behind my firing is not related to October 7. The prime minister made it clear that the decision was due to his claim there is ongoing distrust between us. “The Shin Bet, under my leadership, carried out a thorough investigation that pointed to intelligence and internal process failures on October 7, the repair of which has already begun,” he said. “The need to investigate all parties, including government policy and the prime minister, and not just the IDF and the Shin Bet, who have been thoroughly investigated, is required for public security. If I do not insist upon this, with all the personal prices I will pay, I will fail in my role of providing state security,” he stressed. “Investigating to uncover the truth is of utmost importance in the Shin Bet. The public has a right to know what led to the massacre and the collapse of Israel’s security.” Bar said that his “public responsibility” was a key factor in his decision not to resign for the time being, “in light of the [military] escalation potential, the high security tensions and a real possibility of returning to fighting in the Gaza Strip, in which the Shin Bet has a key role.” He said that he had also wanted to “follow through on my personal commitment and the commitment of the agency to the hostages; the completion of a number of sensitive investigations; and the optimal readiness of the two candidates to replace me, at the prime minister’s choice. “In a previous meeting, I informed the prime minister that I intended to complete the above before I resigned from my position in coordination with him, in light of my responsibility to the public, the security of the country, and the functioning of the Shin Bet for the benefit of the State of Israel,” he finished. In response, an anonymous diplomatic official — generally code for statements from the Prime Minister’s Office — launched a broadside against Bar, saying that he was “confused about who reports to whom.” “The Shin Bet chief’s clinging to the altar harms the Shin Bet and the security of the country,” said the official, accusing Bar of defying Netanyahu in his statement, despite the clarification from the Shin Bet that Bar would step down should his ouster be approved. “If anyone had any doubts about the vital need to remove the Shin Bet chief from his position, they have now received the final answer to that with the anti-democratic response in which he says that he, and not the government, will determine when he will end his position,” the official said. Bar “also decided on the night of October 7 who not to wake up and who not to call,” the official claimed. “The Shin Bet chief repeats the lie that he warned the political echelon against the Hamas attack, while the protocols prove the exact opposite,” claimed the official. “On October 1, 2023, seven days before the massacre, the Shin Bet chief said that Hamas was deterred and that it should be given economic benefits in order to maintain calm.” PM’s critics gear up for legal challenge The feud between the two men appeared to come to a head late last week, when Netanyahu accused Bar of “blackmail,” after his direct predecessor in the security agency, Nadav Argaman, claimed to be sitting on a trove of information that would compromise the prime minister, and threatened to make it public if he breaks the law. Argaman was summoned for questioning by the Israel Police on Sunday for his comments to Channel 12, after Netanyahu filed a complaint against him for “threatening and blackmailing a sitting prime minister.” Netanyahu lodged a similar “blackmail” accusation against Bar. He offered limited detail to explain the claim, but claimed the current Shin Bet chief had held a series of off-record briefings with certain reporters in recent days in order to tarnish the premier. Bar’s agency, in turn, declared that the Shin Bet chief “devotes all of his time to security matters, efforts to recover the hostages and the defense of democracy. Any statement to the contrary is devoid of any truth.” The timing of Netanyahu’s announcement drew immediate scrutiny from critics and opposition lawmakers, who pointed out that the Shin Bet is currently investigating several members of staff in the Prime Minister’s Office for alleged ties with Qatar, thus creating a potential conflict of interest. In a furious statement, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid asserted that Netanyahu was firing Bar “for only one reason — the ‘Qatar-gate’ investigation.” “For a year and a half, he saw no reason to fire him, but only when the investigation into Qatar’s infiltration of Netanyahu’s office and the funds transferred to his closest aides began did he suddenly feel an urgency to fire him immediately,” Lapid said. “Netanyahu has once again put his private interests above the good of the country and its security,” Lapid charged. He said his Yesh Atid party would petition the courts against Bar’s ouster, based on the claim that its goal was “to sabotage a serious criminal investigation of the Prime Minister’s Office.” Where opponents criticized the move, however, Netanyahu’s allies lauded it, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich welcoming the “necessary step.” Otzma Yehudit chair Itamar Ben Gvir — who, when serving as national security minister, was accused by Bar of doing “indescribable damage” to Israel — said that the step should have been taken long ago, but that it was “better late than never.” “The right must learn from President Trump to eradicate the ‘Deep State,'” the ultranationalist lawmaker added. Next in line Bar entered the ranks of the Shin Bet as a field agent in 1993, after completing his IDF service in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit. He was tapped to lead the agency’s Operations Division in 2011, became head of the service’s resource development department in 2016, and from 2018 until 2021 served under Argaman as deputy chief. No decision has been made as to Bar’s replacement, although two top Shin Bet officers are reportedly being considered to succeed him. The first officer is known by the first initial of his name in Hebrew, “Shin,” and is the current deputy head of the Shin Bet. He has been in the deputy role for just two months, though he has served in other senior positions in the agency, including chief of staff and chief of the research division. The second officer being considered is “Mem,” the former deputy chief of the agency. Netanyahu recently appointed him as a member of Israel’s hostage negotiation team, after kicking off Bar. He has also served in several other senior roles in the agency. Both “Shin” and “Mem” served in the Shin Bet as field coordinators, involved in recruiting agents and other sources. According to Hebrew-language media reports, Netanyahu may not choose either of the two officers, but instead bring a defense official from outside the organization to head the Shin Bet, or alternatively a former senior Shin Bet officer. Among the former senior Shin Bet officials reportedly being considered to lead the Shin Bet is Meir Ben Shabbat, who is considered close to Netanyahu. Ben Shabbat formerly headed the Shin Bet’s southern district, and later Israel’s National Security Council.",Netanyahu says he’ll fire Shin Bet chief Bar; AG says he can’t without legal review,"Lazar Berman, Emanuel Fabian, Sam Sokol, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-03-16T21:35:52,2025-03-17T09:34:11,gemini-2.0-flash

It continued, “We will take all necessary measures after this dangerous escalation by Hezbollah militias,” SANA reported. Following Sunday’s announcement, Lebanese media reported that the Syrian Army had begun shelling Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, a Hezbollah stronghold. During the shelling, the terror group denied any responsibility for the kidnapping and murder of the soldiers, telling pro-Hezbollah media, “We reiterate what we have previously announced repeatedly: Hezbollah has no connection to any events taking place within Syrian territory.” Ù

Øµpic.twitter.com Hezbollah-aligned media reported that one person had been killed in the clashes. Riyadh’s Al-Arabiya and Al-Hadath said one Syrian army member was killed and two journalists were wounded by a Hezbollah missile on the Syrian border. Lebanese media reported following the clashes, “The Lebanese Army handed over, via the Lebanese Red Cross, the bodies of three Syrian fighters at a border crossing with Syria.” Many analysts pointed to Israel’s victory over the Iranian proxy during the 2024 invasion of Lebanon as a key factor in the eventual collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. Hezbollah was a key pillar of the Assad regime, and Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to prevent the return of Iranian influence. The Syrian Army has clashed with Hezbollah several times since the Assad regime was overthrown in December.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250317005800315,"SEOUL, March 17 (Yonhap) -- Police said Monday they are set to again apply for arrest warrants for two senior officials of the Presidential Security Service (PSS) accused of obstructing investigators' attempt to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. An official from the National Office of Investigation (NOI) said police have finalized preparations to detain acting PSS chief Kim Seong-hoon and Lee Kwang-woo, chief of the PSS's bodyguard division, and are set to present the applications to the prosecution later Monday. Kim and Lee are accused of obstructing the execution of an arrest warrant for Yoon in January, taking unjust personnel actions and instructing subordinates to delete records of phone conversations between Yoon and military commanders involved in the Dec. 3 martial law declaration. The prosecution previously rejected the police's request to seek arrest warrants for Kim three times and Lee two times. However, a warrant review panel from the Seoul High Prosecutors Office sided with the police on March 6, concluding it was appropriate for the prosecution to request arrest warrants for the two. The police have conducted a supplementary investigation to justify the need to detain Kim and Lee, the NOI official said. ycm@yna.co.kr(END)",Police to again file for arrest warrants for 2 Yoon aides,Yoo Cheong-mo,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-17T14:30:24,2025-03-17T14:30:24,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.riotimesonline.com/bolsonaros-copacabana-rally-falls-short-as-legal-troubles-loom/,"Thousands of supporters gathered at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday to back former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The controversial right-wing leader faces serious legal challenges that could derail his political future. Bolsonaro had called for one million people to attend the demonstration. Local media and university monitoring initiatives estimated actual attendance between 18,000 and 26,000 participants. Supporters dressed in Brazil’s yellow-and-green soccer jerseys chanted slogans and held signs demanding “Amnesty, now!” The rally aimed to pressure Congress to grant amnesty to over 400 individuals convicted for their roles in the January 8, 2023 riots. That day, Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasilia just one week after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office. “Elections without Bolsonaro signify a denial of democracy in Brazil,” the former president told the crowd. He firmly denied allegations of plotting a coup after his 2022 election defeat to Lula. Brazil’s Supreme Court will decide on March 25 whether to proceed with trials against Bolsonaro and several associates. Prosecutor General Paulo Gonet formally charged Bolsonaro last month with attempting to overthrow the government and undermine democracy. Bolsonaro’s Copacabana Rally Falls Short as Legal Troubles Loom The indictment describes Bolsonaro as the head of a criminal organization that allegedly plotted to prevent Lula from taking office. Charges include plans to poison Lula and assassinate Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees multiple cases against Bolsonaro. “Nobody buys that,” Bolsonaro said at the rally regarding the accusations. He maintains these charges represent political persecution designed to prevent his return to power. Bolsonaro hopes to emulate his ally Donald Trump’s political comeback despite being barred from public office until 2030. “As of now, I am a candidate,” he told reporters in Brasilia earlier this week. March 25, 2025: Democracy or Persecution? Five Justices Decide Bolsonaro’s Fate Political analyst Andre Rosa suggested the primary aim of Sunday’s protests was for Bolsonaro to “send a signal to his rivals on the right” about his intentions for 2026. His legal team works to challenge his disqualification from running for office. If convicted on all charges, the former president could face more than 40 years in prison. The case might conclude by early 2026, reshaping Brazil’s political landscape ahead of the next presidential election.

https://apnews.com/article/carney-canada-uk-france-trump-arctic-60993a6e738f797977ef544dc5857ea3,"MONTREAL (AP) — New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is heading to Paris and London on Monday to seek alliances as he deals with U.S. President Donald Trump’s attacks on Canada’s sovereignty and economy. Carney is purposely making his first foreign trip to the capital cities of the two countries that shaped Canada’s early existence. At his swearing-in ceremony on Friday, Carney noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples, French, English and Indigenous, and said Canada is fundamentally different from America and will “never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States.” A senior government government official briefed reporters on the plane before picking up Carney in Montreal and said the purpose of the trip is to double down on partnerships on with Canada’s two founding countries. The official said Canada is a “good friend of the United States but we all know what is going on.” “The Trump factor is the reason for the trip. The Trump factor towers over everything else Carney must deal with,” said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. Carney, a former central banker who turned 60 on Sunday, will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday and later travel to London to sit down with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in an effort to diversify trade and perhaps coordinate a response to Trump’s tariffs. He will also meet with King Charles III, the head of state in Canada. The trip to England is a bit a homecoming, as Carney is a former governor of the Bank of England, the first noncitizen to be named to the role in the bank’s 300-plus-year history. Carney then travels to the edge of Canada’s Arctic to “reaffirm Canada’s Arctic security and sovereignty” before returning to Ottawa where he’s expected to call an election within days. Carney has said he’s ready to meet with Trump if he shows respect for Canadian sovereignty. He said he doesn’t plan to visit Washington at the moment but hopes to have a phone call with the president soon. Sweeping tariffs of 25% and Trump’s talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can. Carney’s government is reviewing the purchase of U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump’s trade war. The governing Liberal Party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war and repeatedly has said Canada should become the 51st state. Now the party and its new leader could come out on top. Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said Carney is wise not to visit Trump. “There’s no point in going to Washington,” Bothwell said. “As (former Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau’s treatment shows, all that results in is a crude attempt by Trump to humiliate his guests.” Bothwell said that Trump demands respect, “but it’s often a one-way street, asking others to set aside their self-respect to bend to his will.” Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said it is absolutely essential that Canada diversify trade amidst the ongoing trade war with the United States. More than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. Béland said Arctic sovereignty is also a key issue for Canada. “President Trump’s aggressive talk about both Canada and Greenland and the apparent rapprochement between Russia, a strong Arctic power, and the United States under Trump have increased anxieties about our control over this remote yet highly strategic region,” Béland said.",New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney seeks alliances in Europe as he deals with Trump | AP News,Rob Gillies,AP News,2025-03-16T12:27:23,2025-03-16T19:12:46,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-to-eu-colleagues-stop-buying-american-buy-european/,"PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron wants to lead a charm offensive to convince EU countries to stop buying U.S. defense equipment and buy French and European instead. Macron, who has been calling for years to direct defense spending toward EU products, said he wants to convince other European countries that are currently ""buying American"" to shift to local options. ""My intention is to go and convince European states that have become accustomed to buying American,"" he said on Saturday in an interview with several French media including Nice-Matin and Le Parisien. ""Those who buy Patriot should be offered the new-generation Franco-Italian SAMP Those who buy the F-35, should be offered the Rafale. That's the way to increase the rate of production,"" he said. Macron's comments come as European NATO members have become even more dependent on U.S. weapons than ever before. This month, the Netherlands and Belgium confirmed they would still buy American-made F-35 fighter jets, while Portugal is wobbling about replacing its U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets with more modern F-35s because of ""the recent position of the United States, in the context of NATO."" Macron said he has asked French defense companies to cut red tape and reduce costs to become a more attractive option, Nice-Matin reported. The French president also clarified what a possible deployment of European troops to help Ukraine could look like. The goal is to ""deploy a few thousand men per nation, at key points, to carry out training programs” and ""show our support over the long term,"" he said. Macron said that the conditions laid down by Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree on a ceasefire in Ukraine ""are unacceptable."" ""This would mean a partial invasion of Ukraine and a freeze on the conflict, without offering any security or guarantees for the future,"" Macron said. Macron announced for ""the coming weeks"" a reform of the so-called ""Service National Universel"" — a voluntary service for people aged between 15 and 17 that includes sporting activities, civic education and a stint at a state organization or nongovernmental organization — ""to meet the nation's needs and the priorities we have identified."" The French president, however, ruled out a comeback of compulsory military service.","Macron to EU colleagues: Stop buying American, buy European",Giorgio Leali,POLITICO,2025-03-16T13:16:37,2025-03-16T15:51:20,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250316-southern-african-bloc-decides-to-end-military-mission-in-drc,"The southern African regional bloc has decided to end its military deployment to the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where it lost at least a dozen soldiers in conflict there in January. The 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) held an extraordinary summit to discuss the conflict in eastern DRC, held via video conference this week. The situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was the main topic on the agenda, with Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi attending the meeting. The participants at the summit decided to terminate the mandate of SAMIDRC, the SADC Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and directed the commencement of a phased withdrawal of SAMIDRC troops from the DRC, the group said in a statement at the end of the meeting. The SAMIDRC was sent to the region in December 2023 to help the government of the DRC, a SADC member, restore peace and security. But South Africa lost 14 soldiers in the eastern DRC conflict in January. Most were from the SAMIDRC mission but at least two were deployed as part of a separate United Nations peacekeeping mission. Three Malawian troops in the SADC deployment were also killed. Officials did not comment on the size of the military deployment, which also includes soldiers from Tanzania. The bulk of the troops come from South Africa, which is estimated to have sent at least 1,000 troops. Calls have been mounting in South Africa for the soldiers still in the DRC to be withdrawn, with reports that they are confined to their base by M23 fighters. Regional conflict The conflict in the area of South and North Kivus has seen some three decades of unrest and claimed millions of lives. The M23 has seized swathes of the mineral-rich and volatile eastern DRC, including the key cities of Goma and Bukavu, in a lightning advance since January. DRC's neighbours are trying to mobilise diplomacy to put an end to this deadly fighting. The virtual SADC summit came a day after Angola announced that peace talks between the DRC and the Rwanda-backed M23 armed group would begin next week. Angola indicates M23 rebels are ready to begin direct peace talks on 18 March Opening Thursday's summit, SADC chairperson and Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa called for a ""greater sense of urgency"" in efforts to end the conflict, which he said could cause instability beyond the DRC's borders. Inclusive dialogue was essential, he said, adding that the review of the SAMIDRC mandate was ""timely"". Angola's presidential office hopes that talks between the DRC and M23 will begin next Tuesday. ""Following the steps taken by the Angolan mediation... delegations from the Democratic Republic of Congo and the M23 will begin direct peace talks on 18Â March in the city of Luanda,"" it said. Angolan President Joao Lourenco had earlier met DRC President Felix Tshisekedi, who had previously refused to engage in dialogue with the M23 as demanded by Rwanda. Angola pushes for direct talks between Kinshasa and M23 in DRC crisis A report by UN experts has said Rwanda maintains some 4,000 troops in the eastern DRC in support of the M23. Rwanda denies providing the group with military assistance. The DRC says the M23's advance has killed more than 7,000 people since the beginning of 2025. These figures remain to be verified independently. (with AFP)",Southern African bloc decides to end military mission in DRC,RFI,RFI,2025-03-16T04:40:46,2025-03-16T04:40:46,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250316002800315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, March 16 (Yonhap) -- The ruling People Power Party (PPP) will accept whatever decision the Constitutional Court makes on President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment trial, the party's floor leader said Sunday, outlining the party's official stance ahead of the ruling. Rep. Kweon Seong-dong's remark came as the court is currently deliberating whether to reinstate or remove Yoon from office after he was impeached over his short-lived martial law declaration on Dec. 3. It has yet to announce the date of the ruling, though many observers expect it to take place this week. ""Our party's official stance is that (we) will accept the court's decision,"" he told reporters. ""As you all know, constitutional trials are single-trial cases ... once a ruling is made, the outcome is binding for everyone."" If Yoon is ousted, the country will be required to hold a snap presidential election within 60 days. If reinstated, he will serve out the remainder of his term through May 2027. Meanwhile, Kweon also called on the court to quickly make a decision on the impeachment trial of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, citing Washington's designation of Seoul as a ""sensitive"" country in January before former President Joe Biden left office. ""It has been 80 days since Prime Minister Han has been suspended from his duties,"" Kweon said. ""We have already wasted a significant amount of golden time at a national level."" On Friday, the U.S. Department of Energy said the Biden administration placed Seoul in the lowest category of its ""sensitive and other designated countries list,"" raising concerns of possible disruptions to joint cooperation in advanced technologies. yunhwanchae@yna.co.kr (END)",Ruling party to accept impending Constitutional Court ruling on Yoon's impeachment,Chae Yun-hwan,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-16T15:32:03,2025-03-16T15:32:03,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/usaid-extremism-ivory-coast-trump-8d8ff11495bfd1350cf88bb48307414c,"KIMBIRILA-NORD, Ivory Coast (AP) 

 With its tomato patches and grazing cattle, the Ivory Coast village of Kimbirila-Nord hardly looks like a front line of the global fight against extremism. But after jihadis attacked a nearby community in Mali five years ago and set up a base in a forest straddling the border, the U.S. committed to spending $20 million to counter the spread of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group here and in dozens of other villages. The Trump administration’s sweeping foreign aid cuts mean that support is now gone, even as violence in Mali and other countries in the Sahel region south of the Sahara has reached record levels and sent tens of thousands refugees streaming into northern Ivory Coast. Locals worry they have been abandoned. Diplomats and aid officials said the termination of aid jeopardizes counterterrorism efforts and weakens U.S. influence in a part of the world where some countries have turned to Russian mercenaries for help. In Kimbirila-Nord, U.S. funding, among other things, helped young people get job training, built parks for cattle to graze so they are no longer stolen by jihadis on Malian territory, and helped establish an information-sharing system so residents can flag violent encounters to each other and state services. “What attracts young people to extremists is poverty and hunger,” said Yacouba Doumbia, 78-year-old chief of Kimbirila-Nord. “There was a very dangerous moment in 2020. The project came at the right time, and allowed us to protect ourselves.”

“Seize a narrow prevention window”

Over the last decade, West Africa has been shaken by extremist uprisings and military coups. Groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have conquered large areas and killed thousands in the Sahel and have been spreading into wealthier West African coastal states, such as Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo. In 2019, President Donald Trump signed the Global Fragility Act that led to the initiatives in northern Ivory Coast. The U.S. goal in this area was to “seize a narrowing prevention window,” according to this year’s congressional report about the implementation of the bipartisan legislation.

Experts say local concerns help drive the popularity of extremist groups: competition for land and resources, exclusion, marginalization and lack of economic opportunities. Across the region, Islamic extremists have recruited among groups marginalized and neglected by central governments. “Ivory Coast is one of the few countries that still resist the terrorist threat in the Sahel,” said a U.N. official working in the country who was not authorized to speak on the matter publicly. “If we do not continue to support border communities, a minor issue could send them into the arms of extremists.” Trump issued an executive order in January directing a freeze on foreign assistance and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad. He charged that much of foreign aid was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.

“Everyone was just looking out for themselves”

In 2020, when the jihadis struck a Malian village 10 kilometers (6 miles) away, Kimbirila-Nord in many ways fit the description of a community susceptible to extremism. The lives of Malians and Ivorians were intertwined. People crossed the border freely, making it easy for extremists, who like residents spoke Bambara, to access Kimbirila-Nord. Many residents did not have identity cards and few spoke French, leaving them with no access to states services or official information. Different ethnic groups lived next to each other but were divided by conflicts over scarce natural resources and suspicions toward the state. And young people did not have opportunities to make money. “We were very scared” when the extremists attacked, said Aminata Doumbia, the head of the village’s female farmers cooperative. “Everyone was just looking out for themselves.” The Ivorian government runs a program that provides professional training, grants and microloans. But access is difficult in villages such as Kimbirila-Nord. Kimbirila-Nord is home to refugees from Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea. Sifata Berte, 23, fled there with his family two years ago from Mali. He is not eligible for the government-run program, but got training through the project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and now works as an apprentice in an iron workshop. Other things the USAID-funded project set up included a network of community radios in local languages, so people could get access to information. It also used mobile government trucks to help tens of thousands of people across the region get their identity documents. And it brought people together with microcredit cooperatives and with a special committee of ranchers and farmers that helps resolve tensions over land. “It’s thanks to the project that we can sleep at night,” Doumbia, the village chief, said. “We learned how to be together.” Equal Access International, an international nonprofit, designed and implemented the U.S.-funded project. The USAID project also has been the only direct source of information on the ground in northern Ivory Coast on violent events for the U.S.-based Armed Conflict and Location & Event Data Project, the main provider of data on violence in the Sahel.

The village had big plans

Ivory Coast became known as a target for extremists in 2016, when an attack on the seaside resort of Grand Bassam killed tourists. In 2021, a string of attacks occurred near the country’s northern border, but the violence has been largely contained after Ivorian authorities, Western governments and aid groups rushed into this impoverished and isolated part of the country with military build up and development projects. In 2024, the U.S. Africa Command provided over $65 million to projects in Ivory Coast, most of which “focused on counterterrorism and border security” in the northern part of the country, according to the group’s website. The Pentagon said in a statement that it was “not aware of any budget cuts that have undermined counterterrorism training or partnership programs in Africa.” Ivory Coast has the second-highest GDP per capita in West Africa, but according to the U.N. it remains one of the world’s least developed countries. Many in remote villages like Kimbirila-Nord do not have access to running water. “At first we thought that we only had to solve these problems with a military solution,” Famy Rene, the prefect of Korhogo, the region’s capital, said. “But we saw that this was not enough. We had to put in place programs that strengthen the resilience of the population.” Residents of Kimbirila-Nord had big plans before the U.S. froze aid. The U.S. was supposed to finance the first well in the village, help create a collective farm, and expand vocational training, Now they fear they have been left alone to deal with extremists. “If you forget, they will come back,” said Doumbia, the village chief. “As long as there is war on the other side of the border, we must remain on a high alert.” ___ For more on Africa and development:  ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y62jrwgwo,"A SpaceX capsule carrying a new crew has docked at the International Space Station (ISS), paving the way for astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to come home. The pair were due to be on the ISS for only eight days, but because of technical issues with the experimental spacecraft they arrived on, they have been there for more than nine months. The astronauts are due to begin their journey back to Earth later this week. Steve Stich, manager of Nasa's commercial crew programme said he was delighted at the prospect. ""Butch and Suni have done a great job and we are excited to bring them back,"" he said. Live footage showed the SpaceX Crew Dragon docking with the ISS and opening a hatch. Shortly after 0545 GMT, the astronauts embraced and hugged their counterparts. The astronauts, along with their ISS workmates, Nasa's Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, will be relieved by four astronauts, from Russia, Japan and two from the US. There will be a two-day handover after which the old crew are due to begin their journey back to Earth. But there could be a small further delay, as they wait for conditions on Earth to be right for a safe re-entry of the returning capsule, according to Dana Weigel, manager, of the ISS programme. ""Weather always has to cooperate, so we'll take our time over that if it is not favourable,"" she told reporters. Ms Weigel explained that the astronauts had begun getting ready for the handover last week. ""Butch rang a ceremonial bell as Suni handed over command to cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin,"" she said. The astronauts have consistently said that they have been happy to be on board the space station, with Suni Williams describing it as her ""happy place"". But Dr Simeon Barber, of the Open University, told BBC News that there would likely have been a personal cost. ""When you are sent on a work trip that is supposed to last a week, you are not expecting it to take the best part of a year,"" he said. ""This extended stay in space will have disrupted family life, things will have happened back home that they will have missed out on, so there will have been a period of upheaval."" Butch and Suni arrived at the ISS at the beginning of June 2024 to test an experimental spacecraft called Starliner, which was built by the aerospace firm Boeing, a rival to SpaceX. The mission had been delayed by several years because of technical issues in the spacecraft's development, and there were problems during its launch and docking on to the ISS. This included issues with some of Starliner's thrusters, which would be needed to slow the spacecraft for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, and leaks of helium gas in the propulsion system. Nasa decided that it would not take even a small risk in bringing back Butch and Suni on Starliner, when they had the option of returning them on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Nasa decided the best option was to do this during a scheduled crew rotation, even though it would mean keeping the astronauts on the space station for several months. Boeing has consistently argued that it would have been safe to bring Butch and Suni back on Starliner, and were unhappy about the decision to use a rival's capsule instead, which will be ""embarrassing"" for Boeing, according to Dr Barber. ""It's not a good look for Boeing to see astronauts they took into space come back in a competitor's craft."" Both President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have said that Butch and Suni could have been brought home sooner, most recently in a joint interview with Fox News in February. President Trump states: ""They got left in space."" When the interviewer, Sean Hannity, elaborates, saying ""They were supposed to be there eight days. They're there almost 300,"" Mr Trump responds with one word: ""Biden."" Mr Musk follows up asserting: ""They were left up there for political reasons."" The assertion is denied by Nasa's Steve Stitch. ""We looked at a wide range of options and worked hand-in-hand with SpaceX to look at what was the best thing to do overall and when we laid all that out the best option was to have the one we are embarking upon,"" he said. That decision was supported by Dr Libby Jackson, who is head of space at the Science Museum in London and worked at Europe's control centre for the ISS. ""Butch and Suni's wellbeing would always have been at the very forefront of everybody's minds as the decisions were being made for how best to deal with the circumstances that they were presented,"" she said. ""Nasa made those decisions based on good technical reasons, on programmatic reasons, and found the right solution that has kept Butch and Suni safe. ""I really look forward to seeing them return to Earth, safe and sound, along with the rest of their crewmates.""",SpaceX capsule docks with ISS as stranded Nasa astronauts prepare return,Pallab Ghosh,BBC News,2025-03-14T19:24:54,2025-03-16T02:38:25,gemini-2.0-flash

Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the center-right Demokraatit party that won this week's parliamentary election, was joined by outgoing Prime Minister Mute B. Egede to lead protesters toward the US consulate on Nuuk's	outskirts. ""We want to be ourselves, and our autonomy and freedom will never be put up for debate,""	Nielsen told the Danish Broadcasting Corporation during the rally. ""There is not the slightest chance that I will talk to Trump about Greenland becoming part of the US. Greenland will be Greenland,""	he said. Speaking to	Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq on Saturday, Egede called the US president's approach ""completely	unacceptable."" What has Trump said about Greenland? Over the past few months, Trump has repeatedly voiced his interest in taking control of Greenland. The US president raised the idea again on Thursday during a meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte at the White House. When asked by a reporter about a possible annexation, Trump said: ""I think it will happen.""	 He went on to say that the territory was fundamental to US national security, stressing that the US already has military bases there. The strategically important Arctic island is home to just 57,000 inhabitants and is a self-governing territory of Denmark. What has Greenland's response been? Lawmakers in Greenland have vehemently opposed Trump's plans to make the island part of the US. On Friday, the leaders of the five parties in Greenland's parliament issued a joint statement rejecting Trump's comments. ""We —	all party chairmen — cannot accept the repeated statements on annexation and control of Greenland,"" they said. ""We, as party chairmen, find this conduct unacceptable to friends and allies in a defense alliance.""

https://apnews.com/article/tornadoes-wildfires-deaths-eb53f6b2463a96b18a08ca9e2db266ab,"PIEDMONT, Mo. (AP) — Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 32 people as more severe weather was expected late Saturday. The number of fatalities increased after the Kansas Highway Patrol reported eight people died in a highway pileup caused by a dust storm in Sherman County on Friday. At least 50 vehicles were involved. In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves announced that six people died in three counties and three more people were missing. There were 29 injuries across the state, he added in a nighttime post on the social platform X. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as scattered twisters overnight killed at least 12, authorities said. The deaths included a man whose home was ripped apart by a tornado. “It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field,” said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. “The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.” AP correspondent Julie Walker reports well over a dozen deaths in a monster storm across the US. Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri. “It was a very rough deal last night,” he said the following day, surrounded by uprooted trees and splintered homes. “It’s really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night.” Henderson said they rescued his aunt from a bedroom that was the only one left standing, taking her out through a window. They also carried out a man who had a broken arm and leg. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties. “We have teams out surveying the damage from last night’s tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She, Reeves and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Kemp said he was doing so in anticipation of severe weather moving in later in the day. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths came as the massive storm system unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area that is home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state, and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) burned in the state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. Experts said it’s not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Significant tornadoes continued to hit Saturday, with the region at highest risk stretching from from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the Storm Prediction Center said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched a massive twister from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, away as it struck an area about half a mile (0.8 km) near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded video of snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles. “The amount of damage was catastrophic,” Dillon said. “It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over — everything was destroyed.” Paradise Ranch said via Facebook that all staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the RV park itself. “Homes and everything were destroyed all around it,” she said. “Schools and buildings are just completely gone.” Some imagery from the extreme weather went viral online. Tad Peters and his father, Richard Peters, had pulled over to fuel up their pickup truck in Rolla, Missouri, on Friday night when they heard tornado sirens and saw other motorists fleeing the interstate to park. “Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it’s here. It’s here,” Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. “Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn ...” His father then rolled up the window. The two were headed to Indiana for a weightlifting competition but decided to head back home to Norman, Oklahoma, about six hours away, where they encountered wildfires. Wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. ___ Walker reported from New York, and Reynolds from Louisville, Kentucky.

https://www.dw.com/en/hungarys-orban-vows-crackdown-on-media-ngos/a-71932327,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told a crowd of his supporters in Budapest on Saturday that he planned to crack down on politicians and journalists who receive funding from abroad. Speaking at an
 event marking Hungary's national day, he said it was time to eliminate what he called a ""shadow army"" of NGOs, journalists, judges and politicians who he said were serving the interests of the EU and a ""liberal American empire."" ""After today's celebrations, comes the big Easter cleaning up as the bugs have survived the winter,"" Orban said. ""We will eliminate the whole shadow army ... who have supported the empire for money, against their own country."" The right-wing populist, an ally of Donald Trump, has taken a tougher stance against foreign-funded media and NGOs since the US president's inauguration in January. He has also welcomed recent steps taken by Washington to dismantle USAID, claiming the development agency was being used to fund liberal causes in Hungary and undermine his government. What measures could Orban take? Last month, Orban announced plans to target foreign funding channeled to Hungarian media. His Fidesz party this week submitted constitutional changes that would allow the expulsion of Hungarian dual citizens if they are deemed to pose a threat to Hungary's sovereignty or national security. Orban's party has also sought to target the LGBTQ+ community, saying the annual Budapest Pride event would be banned in public starting this year. Orban has frequently clashed with the European Union. In his speech on Saturday, he reiterated his opposition to Ukraine joining the bloc and criticized Brussels for continuing to supply Kyiv with military aid in the war with Russia. ""The rulers of Europe decided that Ukraine must continue the war at all costs, and it will get a fast EU membership in exchange, using our money,"" he said. ""We can only have one answer to that: a Union but without Ukraine."" Will Orban survive elections in 2026? Orban, who has ruled Hungary uninterrupted for 15 years, is currently facing pressure from an opposition movement led by moderate conservative and former Fidesz member Peter Magyar. Magyar's upstart Tisza party held a demonstration in Budapest later on Saturday that was attended by tens of thousands of people. Magyar told the crowd he would end Orban's rule and pledged to make Hungary part of a strong Europe. ""Our time has come,"" he said. Independent opinion polls show Tisza neck-and-neck or even several points ahead of Fidesz, with the next general elections due in about one year's time. Magyar has built a strong following in a relatively short period of time by focusing on Hungary's cost-of-living crisis and what he describes as deep-seated corruption among ruling party elites.

https://www.dw.com/en/serbia-protesters-flood-belgrade-with-vucic-under-pressure/a-71933147,"Protesters from all over Serbia
hours were marching in Belgrade on Saturday as the government struggles to stem the monthslong outrage over the deadly fall of the Novi Sad railway station canopy in November. Gatherings were being held in multiple locations in the Serbian capital. Farmers, bikers, military veterans and other groups joined
the demonstrations, with approach routes to key sites clogged by large crowds. ""In front of the parliament there is already a large number of people, and we have seen several processions by bikers and tractor drivers,"" DW correspondent Sanja Klajic reported from the scene. To follow DW's live blog on the Belgrade protests in Serbian, click here. NGO says rally likely 'biggest in Belgrade's history' The number of participants was not immediately clear. The Interior Ministry estimated around 107,000 protesters, although some independent media gave a much higher number in
what is likely the largest protest at least since the ouster of autocrat Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. Serbian NGO Arhiv javnih skupova, which specializes in
counting protesters at
various events, gave a much higher estimate, saying that between 275,000 and 325,000 attended the event. ""Everything indicates this is the biggest rally in Belgrade's history,"" they
said in an online post.
They also published videos from downtown Belgrade showing immense crowds. Unexplained noise startles protesters during solemn silence At least one person was severely injured after being beaten by several people during protests, though circumstances remain unclear. Also an unexplained loud noise, similar to an incoming projectile or a falling aircraft, was heard during 15-minute silence honoring 15 victims of the Novi Sad tragedy, startling the crowd and causing protesters to briefly flee one of Belgrade's streets. While the origin of the noise remains unclear, independent news outlet N1 quoted military analyst Aleksandar Radic as saying that the sound was caused by an acoustic weapon. Radic
described it as a ""sonic cannon,"" which is part of the arsenal available to the Serbian security services. An opposition lawmaker made a similar claim about the source of the noise, N1 reported. ""The only goal of this act is a brutal demonstration of force, a proof of arrogance, motivated by the hatred toward one's own people,"" Radic told N1. However, the police soon denied using
the sonic cannon, saying that this action ""would not have been in accordance with the law."" What are the protests in Serbia about? The Saturday march is seen as a culmination of a monthslong protest movement spearheaded by Serbian students. The protesters are demanding accountability for the deaths of 15 people in Novi Sad who were killed by falling rubble as the outdoor roof section of a train station caved in on them. The train station had been recently renovated under murky circumstances, with the involvement of Chinese companies and businesses with alleged ties to the ruling Progressive Party (SNS). Serbian officials initially claimed no work had been done on the canopy, but later admitted this part of the building was also altered during the reconstruction. The protesters accuse the government of withholding key documents linked to the renovation effort. The government, led by strongman President Aleksandar Vucic, insists all necessary papers have already been made public. In a wider sense, the movement has also encapsulated a whole range of complaints against Vucic and his government, including allegations of widespread corruption, nepotism, mismanaging natural resources, voter fraud, media control and muddled responses to previous deadly incidents linked to government officials. Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Novi Sad mayor Milan Djuric have already resigned amid protests. What did Vucic say? Commenting on the protests on Saturday evening, Vucic said 56 people were injured and 22 detained during the protest on suspicion of vandalism and assault, but no one sustained life-threatening injuries. He said the protest carried ""a huge negative energy, anger and rage directed toward the authorities."" ""We did not raise the nightstick today,"" he told reporters during a press conference. His tone seemed to be more conciliatory
than in recent days, when he
warned of possible violence and repeated his claims that Western intelligence services were behind the unrest. ""I won't allow the street to set the rules,"" he said on Friday. Days ahead of the Saturday march, Vucic warned that officials will ""arrest all troublemakers."" ""We have a state and we will show you the state,"" he said. Rally ends without major clashes Thousands of students and other participants arrived in
Belgrade on Friday evening amid fears that the government would attempt to block transport links to the city. On Saturday, police blocked a major bridge and public transport was suspended. Still, as of Saturday evening, there were no reports of a large-scale police clampdown against protesters, or major clashes between anti-government protesters and mysterious masked men whom the protesters believe are associated with the government. Vucic, who became the country's undisputed political leader in 2014, is considered a nationalist but has pursued a carefully balanced foreign policy and boasts
close working relationships with the US and the EU, as well as with Moscow and Beijing. Edited by: Saim DuÅ¡an Inayatullah",Serbia: Protesters flood Belgrade with Vucic under pressure,Darko Janjevic,Deutsche Welle,2025-03-15T14:08:33,2025-03-17T08:42:52,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/china-g7-maritime-security-2ca16405f82352a62a41eef10866d4f1,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China has lashed out at accusations it is endangering maritime safety made by top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies in a joint statement, saying the G7 members are “filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions.” Even for China’s generally overheated diplomatic language, the statement issued Saturday was unusually vitriolic, although it did not threaten any retaliation. In the Friday statement that sparked the Chinese response, the G7 said, “We condemn China’s illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions that seek unilaterally to alter the status quo in such a way as to risk undermining the stability of regions, including through land reclaimations, and building of outposts, as well as their use for military purpose.” “We reaffirm that our basic policies on Taiwan remain unchanged and emphasize the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to international security and prosperity,” the statement said, referring to the crucial waterway separating China from the self-governing island republic it claims as its own territory. In the response issued through its embassy in Canada, where the two-day G7 meeting was held in La Malbaie, Quebec, China said the statement “repeated the same old rhetoric, ignored facts and China’s solemn position, grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs, and blatantly smeared China.” “The statements are filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions to suppress and attack China. China strongly deplores and opposes	this and has lodged solemn representations with the Canadian side,” the statement said. China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, through which passes around $5 trillion in global trade. It has dismissed and occasionally clashed with other countries that claim parts of the sea, especially the Philippines, a U.S. treaty partner. China is not a member of the G7 but closely follows all comments and references to its international status made by international organizations or in foreign countries, responding to criticism with caustic language. China has firmly rejected a U.N.-affiliated court’s ruling that invalidated most of its claims to the South China Sea and says its claim to Taiwan is non-negotiable, even if China has to use force against the island. China routinely sends ships and warplanes into airspace and waters near Taiwan, built military bases on human-made islands in the South China Sea and recently staged surprise live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand for which it gave no advance notice. Australia’s aviation authority said it learned of the drills just 30 minutes before they began, not from Beijing but from a pilot flying in the area, and 49 commercial flights were forced to alter their flight paths in response. The G7 did not mention the drills in its statement. “We share a growing concern at recent, unjustifiable efforts to restrict such freedom and to expand jurisdiction through use of force and other forms of coercion, including across the Taiwan Strait, and in the South China Sea, the Red Sea, and the Black Sea,” the G7 said. China has the world’s largest navy, including three aircraft carriers, with a fourth on the way. It has a base in Sheikhdom of Djibouti in the Horn of Africa and consistently has expanded the range of the force.",China lashes out at G7 over statements on maritime security,Christopher Bodeen,AP News,2025-03-15T08:41:03,2025-03-15T08:53:03,gemini-2.0-flash

Russia ""does not give the impression it sincerely wants peace,"" Macron said in a statement provided to AFP following a Saturday morning video conference of countries backing Ukraine organised by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. On the contrary, Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""escalating the fighting"" and ""wants to get everything, then negotiate,"" he said. ""Russia must respond clearly and the pressure must be clear, in conjunction with the United States, to obtain this ceasefire,"" he added. In a statement released later Saturday, his office said Macron would Canada's new prime minister Mark Carney on Monday to discuss the war in Ukraine and ""other international crises"". Since returning to the White House in January, US President Donald Trump has stressed his desire to end the three-year old conflict, and has made a spectacular rapprochement with Vladimir Putin. After a very public falling out between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House last month, Kyiv has worked to restore relations. It has backed Washington's proposed a 30-day ceasefire, which Russia has not accepted. 'Moment of truth'""This is a moment of truth because if Russia does not sincerely commit to peace, President Trump will toughen sanctions and retaliation, and so that will completely change the dynamic,"" Macron said in a interview Friday with French regional papers that was posted late Saturday. He said planning was accelerating among countries willing to provide security guarantees for Ukraine following any eventual ceasefire, such as France and Britain. Military leaders from some 30 countries met in Paris on March 11 to discuss plans for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, and will meet again Thursday in Britain. ""Several European countries, and indeed non-European ones, have expressed their willingness to join"" a possible deployment to Ukraine to secure a future peace agreement with Russia, said Macron. This would involve ""a few thousand troops"" per state, deployed at key points, to conduct training programmes and ""show our long-term support"", he told the regional papers. Moscow has firmly opposed such a deployment. But Macron said: ""If Ukraine requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up to Russia to accept or reject them. Macron will travel to Berlin Tuesday for talks with Chancellor Olaf Scholz for talks on Ukraine ahead of an EU summit, Berlin has announced.

The strikes will last ""days, possible weeks"" an official told Reuters. The Houthi-run health ministry reported that the US strikes have killed over 23 people and wounded more than 20 others in Yemen on Saturday. An Israeli official told Walla that the US informed Israel in advance of the attacks on Yemen. The air and naval strikes hit the Houthisâ	ms radars, air defenses, and missile and drone systems, The New York Times reported. The Houthi TV channel said that an electrical installation in the city of Dahyan, in the Saada province in northwestern Yemen, was also struck resulting in a loss of electricity across the city. US President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that â	stoday, I have ordered the United States military to launch decisive and powerful military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen.

The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important waterways of the world, grinding vast swaths of global commerce to a halt, and attacking the core principle of freedom of navigation upon which international trade and commerce depends.â	mt The president concluded the post with a message to the Houthis and to Iran. â	mtTo all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY.

(AP) — President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Iran-backed rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said at least 31 people were killed, and Trump’s national security adviser said Sunday that the strikes had successfully targeted “multiple” Houthi leaders. “Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,” Trump said in a social media post. “No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.” He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S. leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran’s advancing nuclear program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out,” Trump national security adviser Michael Waltz said on ABC’s “This Week.” that aired Sunday. The Houthis reported explosions in their territory Saturday evening, in the capital of Sanaa and the northern province of Saada, the rebels’ stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia, with more airstrikes reported in those areas early Sunday. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The Houthis also reported airstrikes early Sunday on the provinces of Hodeida, Bayda, and Marib. The Houthi-run Health Ministry said early Sunday that the death toll had climbed to 31, including women and children. Anees al-Asbahi, a spokesperson for the ministry, said Sunday that another 101 people were wounded. A U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won’t deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. “Sanaa will remain Gaza’s shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges,” he added on social media. Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump’s claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes “false and misleading.” The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel’s latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of “additional consequences” for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn’t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when this ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis’ profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemen’s decade-long stalemated war that’s torn apart the Arab world’s poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa’s northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children. “The explosions were very strong,” said Abdallah al-Alffi. “It was like an earthquake.” The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels’ political bureau, located in a densely populated area. The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel’s military declined to comment. However, Saturday’s operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration. Such broad-based missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region.  The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday’s mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. “These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said. ___ Baldor reported from Washington and Magdy reported from Cairo.

https://apnews.com/article/tornadoes-wildfires-deaths-eb53f6b2463a96b18a08ca9e2db266ab,"PIEDMONT, Mo. (AP) — Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 32 people as more severe weather was expected late Saturday. The number of fatalities increased after the Kansas Highway Patrol reported eight people died in a highway pileup caused by a dust storm in Sherman County on Friday. At least 50 vehicles were involved. In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves announced that six people died in three counties and three more people were missing. There were 29 injuries across the state, he added in a nighttime post on the social platform X. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as scattered twisters overnight killed at least 12, authorities said. The deaths included a man whose home was ripped apart by a tornado. “It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field,” said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. “The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.” AP correspondent Julie Walker reports well over a dozen deaths in a monster storm across the US. Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri. “It was a very rough deal last night,” he said the following day, surrounded by uprooted trees and splintered homes. “It’s really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night.” Henderson said they rescued his aunt from a bedroom that was the only one left standing, taking her out through a window. They also carried out a man who had a broken arm and leg. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties. “We have teams out surveying the damage from last night’s tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She, Reeves and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Kemp said he was doing so in anticipation of severe weather moving in later in the day. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths came as the massive storm system unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area that is home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state, and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) burned in the state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. Experts said it’s not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Significant tornadoes continued to hit Saturday, with the region at highest risk stretching from from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the Storm Prediction Center said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched a massive twister from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, away as it struck an area about half a mile (0.8 km) near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded video of snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles. “The amount of damage was catastrophic,” Dillon said. “It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over — everything was destroyed.” Paradise Ranch said via Facebook that all staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the RV park itself. “Homes and everything were destroyed all around it,” she said. “Schools and buildings are just completely gone.” Some imagery from the extreme weather went viral online. Tad Peters and his father, Richard Peters, had pulled over to fuel up their pickup truck in Rolla, Missouri, on Friday night when they heard tornado sirens and saw other motorists fleeing the interstate to park. “Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it’s here. It’s here,” Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. “Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn ...” His father then rolled up the window. The two were headed to Indiana for a weightlifting competition but decided to head back home to Norman, Oklahoma, about six hours away, where they encountered wildfires. Wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. ___ Walker reported from New York, and Reynolds from Louisville, Kentucky.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/15/2003833460,"China and Russia yesterday joined Iran in denouncing US sanctions, and backed efforts to restore a landmark nuclear deal with Tehran that US President Donald Trump abandoned in his first term and now wants to replace. The three countries — all sanctioned by the US to varying degrees — stressed the need to end unilateral restrictions and urged the resumption of international talks over Iran’s atomic activities at a meeting in Beijing, a joint statement said. Russia and China were key participants in the agreement signed during former US president Barack Obama’s administration that restricted Iran’s nuclear activity in exchange for sanctions relief, before Trump’s withdrawal in 2018. Photo: AFP As the standoff drags on, Iran has expanded its stocks of near-bomb grade enriched uranium, while Washington has toughened its sanctions. Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu (馬朝旭) hosted yesterday’s meeting, which was also attended by Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Ryabkov and his Iranian counterpart, Kazem Gharibabadi. A separate meeting included Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi (王毅). “Political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue based on the principle of mutual respect remains the only viable and practical option,” Ma told reporters after the meeting. Last week, Trump reiterated his interest in striking a new nuclear deal with Iran and warned the only alternative for the Islamic republic was to face military action. The Beijing gathering follows a flurry of diplomatic activity on Iran’s nuclear program as world powers try to evade another crisis, at a time when wars in the Middle East and Ukraine are posing risks to energy prices and the global economy. Iran has already had at least two rounds of preliminary nuclear talks with diplomats from the UK, France and Germany in Geneva in recent months. Trump also wrote a letter addressed to the Iranian leadership, which was received in Tehran on Wednesday via a top official from the United Arab Emirates. The contents of the missive are not known and there has been no official response. The participants in Beijing emphasized the need for all countries to abstain from actions that would undermine the inspection activities of the International Atomic Energy Agency monitors still working in Iran. The UN watchdog last month reported a surge in nuclear activity in Iran over the past few months. “The situation has reached a critical juncture again. We must buy time for peace, resolve disputes through political and diplomatic means, and oppose the use of force and illegal sanctions,” Wang told reporters.","China, Russia unite behind Tehran to challenge US plans",Bloomberg,台北時報,2025-03-15T00:00:00,2025-03-14T23:40:13,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/head-of-isis-in-iraq-and-syria-killed-in-airstrike-during-us-iraqi-joint-operation/,"BAGHDAD (AP) — The head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been killed in Iraq in an operation by members of the Iraqi national intelligence service along with US-led coalition forces, the Iraqi prime minister announced Friday. “The Iraqis continue their impressive victories over the forces of darkness and terrorism,” Prime Minister Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said in a statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. Abdallah Maki Mosleh al-Rifai, or “Abu Khadija,” was “deputy caliph” of the militant group and as “one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world,” the statement said. On his Truth Social platform Friday night, US President Donald Trump said: “Today the fugitive leader of ISIS in Iraq was killed. He was relentlessly hunted down by our intrepid warfighters” in coordination with the Iraqi government and the Kurdish regional government. “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!” Trump posted. A security official said the operation was carried out by an airstrike in Anbar province, in western Iraq. A second official said the operation took place Thursday night but that al-Rifai’s death was confirmed Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. CENTCOM Forces Kill ISIS Chief of Global Operations Who Also Served as ISIS #2 On March 13, U.S. Central Command forces, in cooperation with Iraqi Intelligence and Security Forces, conducted a precision airstrike in Al Anbar Province, Iraq, that killed the Global ISIS #2 leader,… The announcement came on the same day as the first visit by Syria’s top diplomat to Iraq, during which the two countries pledged to work together to combat ISIS. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein said at a news conference that “there are common challenges facing Syrian and Iraqi society, and especially the terrorists of IS.” He said the officials had spoken “in detail about the movements of ISIS, whether on the Syrian-Iraqi border, inside Syria or inside Iraq” during the visit. Hussein referred to an operations room formed by Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon at a recent meeting in Amman to confront IS, and said it would soon begin work. The relationship between Iraq and Syria is somewhat fraught after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Al-Sudani came to power with the support of a coalition of Iran-backed factions, and Tehran was a major backer of Assad. The current interim president of Syria, Ahmad al-Sharaa, was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani and fought as an al-Qaida militant in Iraq after the US invasion of 2003, and later fought against Assad’s government in Syria. But Syrian interim Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani focused on the historic ties between the two countries. “Throughout history, Baghdad and Damascus have been the capitals of the Arab and Islamic world, sharing knowledge, culture and economy,” he said. Strengthening the partnership between the two countries “will not only benefit our peoples, but will also contribute to the stability of the region, making us less dependent on external powers and better able to determine our own destiny,” he said. The operation and the visit come at a time when Iraqi officials are anxious about an ISIS resurgence in the wake of the fall of Assad in Syria. While Syria’s new rulers – led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham – have pursued IS cells since taking power, some fear a breakdown in overall security that could allow the group to stage a resurgence. The US and Iraq announced an agreement last year to wind down the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by September 2025, with US forces departing some bases where they have stationed troops during a two-decade-long military presence in the country. When the agreement was reached to end the coalition’s mission in Iraq, Iraqi political leaders said the threat of ISIS was under control and they no longer needed Washington’s help to beat back the remaining cells. But the fall of Assad in December led some to reassess that stance, including members of the Coordination Framework, a coalition of mainly Shiite, Iran-allied political parties that brought current Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani to power in late 2022.",Head of ISIS in Iraq and Syria killed in airstrike during US-Iraqi joint operation,Qassim Abdul-Zahra,The Times of Israel,2025-03-15T05:57:07,2025-03-15T14:15:03,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250315003400315?section=national/diplomacy,"SEOUL, March 15 (Yonhap) -- Seoul takes the U.S. Department of Energy's decision to put South Korea on a ""sensitive country"" list ""seriously,"" the foreign ministry said Saturday, while vowing to actively consult with Washington on the matter. The Department of Energy (DOE) confirmed it designated South Korea in the lowest category of its ""sensitive and other designated countries list"" (SCL) in early January under the previous Biden administration. If the addition goes into effect on April 15 as scheduled, it could make it hard for South Korea to join U.S. initiatives on advanced technologies, such as nuclear energy, artificial intelligence and quantum technology. ""(The government) will actively negotiate with (the United States) to prevent the designation from negatively affecting cooperation on energy and science technology between South Korea and the U.S.,"" the ministry official said. The ministry has faced criticism over its apparent diplomatic failure to avert the DOE designation, as it is believed to have been unaware of the move until recently. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul told the National Assembly on Tuesday that the ministry is working to grasp the situation after having obtained such information through an ""informal"" channel. Apparently mindful of criticism about Seoul's diplomatic incompetency, the official suggested Saturday that it was difficult to learn of related developments, saying the measure was apparently reviewed internally within the DOE with no information shared. But the official declined to answer a question about when the ministry became aware of Seoul's addition to the SCL, reiterating that it informally grasped the DOE's move before a related news report first emerged Monday. ""We will continue to contact high-level officials at the DOE, the State Department and other related agencies and actively consult with them on the matter in order to rectify the list,"" the official said.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-15-2025-b54c0c11c4d7f0ca52653edb033c70f5,"CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Saturday it will only release an American-Israeli and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel implements their ceasefire agreement, calling it an “exceptional deal” aimed at getting the truce back on track. Israeli airstrikes meanwhile killed nine people in the Gaza Strip who the military identified as militants, allegations denied by a U.K.-based aid group that said eight of its workers were killed. A senior Hamas official said long-delayed talks over the ceasefire’s second phase would need to begin the day of the release and last no longer than 50 days. Israel also would need to stop barring the entry of humanitarian aid and withdraw from a strategic corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Israel has said it won’t pull out from the corridor, citing the need to combat weapons smuggling. Hamas would also demand the release of more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. Edan Alexander, 21, who grew up in New Jersey, was abducted from his military base during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. He is the last living U.S. citizen held in Gaza. Hamas still has 59 hostages, 35 believed to be dead. Speaking at a protest camp set up last week outside Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, relatives of hostages said Netanyahu was “violating the agreement he signed and abandoning the hostages in Gaza.” “You want to sacrifice our children for the pleasures of power,” said Itzik Horn, father of hostage Eitan and freed hostage Iair. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late Saturday told negotiators to prepare for the continuation of talks regarding the release of hostages, his office said. Two Israeli airstrikes in the northern town of Beit Lahiya near the border killed at least nine people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Palestinian Journalists’ Protection Center, a local watchdog, said the dead included three Palestinian journalists who were documenting aid distribution. Local health official Fares Awad identified one as Mahmoud Islim, who was operating a drone. The Israeli military said it struck two people operating a drone that it said posed a threat to soldiers in the area. It said it launched another strike at a group of people who came to collect the drone equipment, identifying all those targeted as militants. The army later released the names of six people it said were militants killed in the strikes, including one accused of taking part in the Oct. 7 attack and another who it said had been released as part of the ceasefire. The military said two others, including Islim, were militants posing as journalists. The UK-based Al Khair Foundation said that eight of its workers were killed in the strikes. It denied the Israeli military’s allegations that those killed were militants or had connections to Hamas. Hamas in a statement called the attack a “serious escalation” showing Israel’s attempts to “sabotage any opportunity” to implement the ceasefire agreement. Also Saturday, Israel’s military said it removed a platoon of soldiers from Gaza who were seen in a video on social media opening fire during a celebration of the Jewish holiday of Purim. The video shows soldiers shooting, apparently randomly, while another performs the customary reading of the Book of Esther. The military said the soldiers “will face disciplinary measures.” No major fighting has occurred in Gaza since the ceasefire took hold on Jan. 19, but Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military said had entered unauthorized areas, engaged in militant activities or otherwise violated the truce. The United States said it presented on Wednesday a proposal to extend the ceasefire a few weeks as the sides negotiate a permanent truce. It said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making “entirely impractical” demands. Talks continued in Egypt, which along with Qatar has served as mediators with Hamas in the indirect talks with Israel. Israel and Hamas were to begin negotiations on the ceasefire’s second phase in early February, but only preparatory talks have been held. In Phase Two, Hamas would release all remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting truce. The first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone along Gaza’s border and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid. After the first phase ended early this month, Israel said it had agreed to a new U.S. proposal in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages in return for a vague commitment to negotiate a lasting ceasefire. Hamas rejected that offer. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that he held in-depth discussions with the negotiating team and security officials on Saturday evening. Afterward, he told the negotiating team to prepare for continued talks as per the mediator’s response to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff’s proposal, the statement said. For two weeks, Israel has barred the delivery of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, and cut electricity to the territory a week ago, to pressure Hamas to accept the new proposal. The southern city of Rafah, on the Gaza-Egypt border, said it could no longer provide fuel needed to pump water from dozens of wells. Ahmed al-Sufi, head of the municipality, said fuel shortages caused by the Israeli siege have forced it to “suspend essential services, threatening the lives of thousands.” The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displaced most of the population and left nearly everyone dependent on international aid. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. Most have been released in deals, while Israel rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250315001500315,"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Yonhap) -- The placement of South Korea on the U.S. Department of Energy's ""sensitive country"" list might pose a tricky test to the bilateral alliance, experts said Friday, as the decadeslong partnership is facing headwinds, including President Donald Trump's growing tariff pressure. The department confirmed the preceding Biden administration added the Asian ally to the ""lowest"" category of the DOE Sensitive and Other Designated Countries List in early January -- a move that called into question Seoul's diplomatic capacity at a time of political uncertainty triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment over his martial law bid in December. Barring an agreement between the allies, the designation is set to take effect April 15. The list involves a group of countries subject to stricter scrutiny when access is requested to DOE research institutions or other facilities for technology cooperation or other purposes. It includes North Korea, Russia and China. ""Obviously designating South Korea on this 'sensitive' list would be troubling for the alliance, signaling distrust on the part of the U.S. and disbelief from the Koreans that their closest ally would put them in a category usually reserved more for adversaries than allies,"" Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation chair at the Brookings Institution's Center for East Asia Policy Studies, told Yonhap News Agency via email. It remains unknown why the Biden administration put South Korea, long a stalwart treaty ally, to the list. The addition came as South Korea was thrust into political turmoil due to Yoon's short-lived martial law imposition and his subsequent impeachment -- a saga that raised questions over whether Seoul and Washington can maintain as smooth and strong policy coordination as they did before. It also proceeded as public calls for South Korea's own nuclear program have persisted, with North Korea defiantly doubling down on its own nuclear program amid fears Russia will provide nuclear technology to Pyongyang under a bilateral ""comprehensive strategic partnership"" treaty. In early 2023, Yoon hinted at the possibility of South Korea seeking an independent nuclear program, apparently drawing concerns in Washington, as Pyongyang ramped up tensions on the Korean Peninsula with a ratcheted-up frequency of provocative acts. But Yoon reaffirmed Seoul's commitment to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the ""Washington Declaration"" in April that year, as the declaration involved a stronger U.S. nuclear deterrence commitment to South Korea, including the establishment of the Nuclear Consultative Group, the allies' key deterrence mechanism. Public calls for South Korea's nuclear armament, however, did not relent. Last year's survey by the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification found that 66 percent of South Koreans were in favor of their country going nuclear. Patrick Cronin, chair for Asia-Pacific security at the Washington-based Hudson Institute, said that the Biden administration's decision to add Korea to the list might be an effort to guard against the possibility of Trump backing Seoul's potential nuclearization. ""If the Biden administration made this designation, it may have been a way of handcuffing the Trump administration from leaning into possible support for a South Korean nuclear weapon capability,"" Cronin told Yonhap News Agency via email. The designation, albeit not effectuated, spawned concerns that it could serve as a stumbling block to the two countries' efforts to broaden their partnership into a ""global comprehensive strategic"" alliance that covers not only security but also new realms like emerging technologies. Expectations have been growing particularly for nuclear reactor cooperation as Seoul and Washington signed an arrangement on principles concerning nuclear exports and cooperation earlier this year, with the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and U.S.-based Westinghouse settling an intellectual property rights dispute. Cronin voiced his opposition to the designation of South Korea. ""First, I do not think South Korea should be placed on this list. If a South Korean government was determined to create an independent nuclear weapon capability, then there should be a U.S. policy debate about what steps to take. In that context, sensitive country designation is one of several possible responses,"" Cronin said. ""Second, putting South Korea on this list, which complicates permits for technology cooperation, makes little sense while South Korea is dealing with a suspended president and a pending Constitutional Court verdict that could trigger a quick election,"" he added. In response to a question from Yonhap News Agency, a DOE spokesperson said that inclusion on the list does not necessarily indicate an ""adversarial"" relationship with the U.S. But many expect it could pose a psychological impediment to South Koreans seeking closer technology cooperation with the U.S. ""Many designated countries are those we regularly cooperate with on a variety of energy, science, technology, counterterrorism and nonproliferation issues,"" the DOE spokesperson told Yonhap News Agency. The official added: ""The designation does not prohibit scientific or technical cooperation. These visits and cooperation undergo an internal review beforehand."" Many observers said the designation would put to the test Seoul's diplomacy aimed at preventing the designation from going into effect next month, while some pointed out the apparent failure to preemptively avert the designation during the Biden administration. ""It is correct that the preceding Biden administration put South Korea on the list,"" a diplomatic source in Washington said. ""I understand that (South Korean authorities) are in consultations with the U.S. side to redress that before it goes into effect on April 15."" The designation came in the midst of brewing trade tensions between Seoul and Washington. Trump plans to levy ""reciprocal tariffs"" on South Korea and other trading partners on April 2, which will be pegged to countries' tariffs on U.S. products, their non-tariff barriers and other elements like exchange rate policies. Trump recently claimed South Korea's average tariff is four times higher than that of the U.S. -- a remark that laid bare his seeming perception of the Asian ally as an unfair trading partner. He is also moving to impose new tariffs on cars, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber derivatives -- items South Korea exports to the U.S. On top of that, concerns have continued over the possibility of Trump demanding a sharp increase in Seoul's share of the cost for stationing the 28,500-strong U.S. Forces Korea, as he argued that America has helped South Korea ""militarily"" and ""in so many other ways."" sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)",(News Focus) U.S. designation of S.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250315000900315,"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Yonhap) -- Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo said Friday that he has called for the Trump administration to grant South Korea tariff exemptions and ensure the Asian ally will be treated in a ""non-discriminatory"" way. Cheong met U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington earlier in the day, as President Donald Trump plans to roll out ""reciprocal tariffs"" on April 2, which will be pegged to U.S. trading partners' duties on American goods, non-tariff barriers and other elements, including exchange rate policies. ""I have requested tariff exemptions for South Korea, or at least non-discriminatory treatment (to Korea) compared with major countries,"" Cheong said during a meeting with Korean correspondents in Washington. Cheong also said he highlighted that reciprocal tariffs on South Korea should not be based on Trump's recent remark in a congressional address claiming that Korea's average tariff is four times higher than that of the U.S. Seoul has countered Trump's claim by saying South Korea's average tariff rate on U.S. products stands at less than 1 percent under a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA). South Korea's average tariff on its most-favored nations (MFNs) stands at around 13.4 percent -- compared with the U.S.' 3.3 percent on its MFNs -- but that rate is not applicable to countries with free trade deals with Asia's fourth-largest economy. ""The U.S. side was also aware that in accordance with the FTA, both countries' tariffs are near zero percent,"" he said. ""While sharing the understanding about the usefulness of the Korea-U.S. FTA as a framework for comprehensive economic cooperation, (the two sides) agreed to explore a reasonable and mutually beneficial way through continued working-level consultations on tariff measures,"" Cheong said. Moreover, the minister used his meeting with the USTR to underscore the need for exempting South Korean steel products from 25 percent tariffs that went into effect earlier this week. ""I explained that South Korean steel exports do not pose a threat to the security of the U.S. industry, and that they are rather contributing to the supply chain stabilization and downstream industrial competitiveness through the supply of items whose production falls short in the U.S.,"" he said. sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)",Seoul trade minister renews calls for USTR to grant S.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg815277g5o,"Sudan has suspended all imports from Kenya in protest after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are fighting the army in a two-year civil war, were hosted in Nairobi. Last month, the RSF and its allied political and armed groups signed a founding charter in Kenya expressing the intention to form a parallel government in Sudan. Sudan's military government said the import ban was to preserve the country's sovereignty and ""protect its national security"". The war-torn country imports several products from Kenya including tea, food items and pharmaceutical products. ""The import of all products coming from Kenya through all ports, crossings, airports, and ports will be suspended as of this day until further notice,"" a decree issued by Sudan's ministry of trade stated. It ordered ""all relevant authorities to enforce the ban immediately"". Tensions between Kenya and Sudan have been escalating for several months. Kenyan President William Ruto has faced widespread criticism at home for his perceived close ties with the RSF. Last month, Sudan recalled its ambassador to Kenya in protest against Nairobi's  involvement in a ""conspiracy to establish a government"" for the RSF. Sudan called Kenya's hosting of RSF meetings ""tantamount to an act of hostility"". But Kenya defended its role, stating that hosting the meetings was part of efforts to find solutions to end the war in Sudan ""without any ulterior motives"". Both countries have traditionally enjoyed strong trade relations, with Kenya being an important partner for Sudan, particularly in agriculture and manufacturing. Kenya exports a range of goods to Sudan, with tea being its most significant export, followed by coffee, tobacco, and other products such as soaps, electrical equipment, and pharmaceuticals. Tea is one of Kenya's most significant foreign exchange earners, and this move is expected to disrupt both trade flows and the broader economy. ""This ban will be a big blow, and foreign exchange will take a hit. It would mean less foreign exchange and greater exposure to financial services. It has a ripple effect that extends beyond just trade,"" economist Ken Gichinga told the BBC. Sudan is one of the top five destinations for Kenyan tea and producers are worried about the effects of the ban. The East African Tea Trade Association (EATTA) expressed concerns over ongoing contracts and shipments stuck in transit. ""Teas are currently at Port Sudan, and several containers already dispatched are now stranded in the high seas,"" it said. Large stocks in Kenya's port city of Mombasa also cannot be shipped out. ""This will result in unfathomable losses incurred by buyers and will trickle down to producers and farmers,"" the association warned. RSF advisor El Basha Tebeig sought to reassure Kenya, stating on X that the group would ""guarantee the smooth passage of Kenyan goods into Sudan"" in those areas it controls. But Port Sudan is in the hands of the army and has become the seat of the military government because of the fighting in Khartoum. The Kenyan government is yet to comment but Agriculture Minister Mutahi Kagwe recently said his country was exploring diplomatic avenues to address the market access challenges in Sudan. Kenya's tea exports to Sudan have already been affected by the conflict there. A recent report showed a 12% reduction in Kenyan tea exports to Sudan over the past year. The war in Sudan, which began in April 2023, has caused widespread destruction, disrupting supply chains and limiting the ability of businesses to operate normally. Ports and border crossings, vital for trade, have been either damaged or obstructed by the violence, significantly reducing the flow of goods between Sudan and its neighbours, including Kenya. The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including the capital Khartoum - with thousands of people killed and more than 12 million displaced, according to the United Nations.",Sudan bans all Kenyan imports after it hosted RSF,Akisa Wandera,BBC News,2025-03-14T08:18:21,2025-03-14T12:59:37,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-says-it-has-agreed-to-release-us-israeli-hostage-edan-alexander-bodies-of-4-slain-dual-nationals/,"Hamas in an official statement says it has agreed to a proposal to release hostage soldier Edan Alexander, who is a US citizen, as well as the bodies of four other slain captives who are dual nationals. Alexander is a soldier who was stationed near the Gaza Strip on the morning of October 7 when he was taken captive by Hamas. Hamas does not provide the names of the four slain dual nationals. The terror group says it “affirms its complete readiness to initiate negotiations and reach a comprehensive agreement on the issues of the second phase while calling for the occupation (Israel) to fully implement its obligations.” The Hamas statement indicates that the terror group has accepted a proposal thot was discussed during direct talks with US hostage envoy Adam Boehler, which had been held in recent weeks. Those talks infuriated Jerusalem, which wasn’t fully kept in the loop, didn’t like that Boehler was discussing Israeli concessions without its knowledge and feared it would lead Washington to abandon the remaining Israeli hostages after such a deal was reached. But Boehler’s remit is specifically to try and free American hostages worldwide and his effort was approved by US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff when the main track of negotiations was stuck due to Israel’s refusal to accept the terms of the current deal’s second phase. There hadn’t appeared to have been a breakthrough in Boehler’s direct talks — which ended after Israel learned about them and leaked their existence to the media, according to two US officials — and the hostage negotiations had returned to their original channel led by Witkoff with mediation from Qatar and Egypt in Doha. Hamas’s decision to suddenly accept a proposal to release the American hostages points to an attempt to divide the US and Israel by daring Jerusalem to deny an opportunity to free American hostages.","Hamas says it has agreed to release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, bodies of 4 slain dual nationals","Emanuel Fabian, Jacob Magid",The Times of Israel,2025-03-14T07:03:52,2025-03-14T10:37:58,gemini-2.0-flash

The bill, passed by the Democratic Party-controlled parliament on Feb. 27, seeks an investigation into allegations that Myung Tae-kyun, a self-proclaimed power broker, received approximately 76 million won (US$52,300) from former ruling party lawmaker Kim Young-sun in exchange for helping secure her nomination in the by-elections. Acting President Choi Sang-mok speaks during a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on March 14, 2025. (Yonhap) The special counsel would also investigate allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee were involved in the nomination process for both the 2022 local elections and last year's parliamentary elections. ""The scope of the investigation is excessively broad and lacks clarity, raising concerns about potential violations of the constitutional principles of precision and proportionality,"" Choi said while presiding over an extraordinary Cabinet meeting. Myung allegedly secured Kim Young-sun's nomination in return for conducting public opinion polls favorable to Yoon ahead of the 2022 presidential election. Both Myung and the former People Power Party lawmaker, Kim Young-sun, have already been indicted. ""In a situation where a prosecution investigation is gaining momentum, introducing a special counsel probe goes against the fundamental purpose of the special prosecutor system,"" Choi added. Choi urged the prosecution to take the matter seriously, seemingly addressing opposition parties' accusations that the prosecution was downplaying the case. ""The prosecution must stake its credibility on this investigation and conduct a swift and impartial inquiry into the relevant allegations without providing anyone any sanctuary,"" Choi said. It marks the eighth time Choi has exercised veto power since assuming interim leadership in December, including a special counsel probe bill into Yoon over his imposition of martial law. The Democratic Party has intensified its criticism of Choi, accusing him of repeatedly using his veto authority to block key opposition-led bills. Typically, motions of this nature are approved during Cabinet meetings chaired by the prime minister and then sent to the president for endorsement before being returned to the National Assembly for a revote. khj@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) Acting president vetoes bill on special counsel probe into Yoon over election influence-peddling,Kim Han-joo,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-14T09:57:53,2025-03-14T09:57:53,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250314-armenia-azerbaijan-announce-agreement-to-sign-peace-deal,"Armenia and Azerbaijan on Thursday said they had agreed to sign a peace deal after decades of conflict, with Armenia agreeing to surrender its claim over the primarily Armenian-populated Karabakh region. A deal to normalise ties would be a major breakthrough in a region where Russia, the European Union, the United States and Turkey all jostle for influence. Baku and Yerevan fought two wars for control of Azerbaijan's Armenian-populated region of Karabakh, at the end of the Soviet Union and again in 2020, before Azerbaijan seized the entire area in a 24-hour offensive in September 2023. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan have repeatedly said a comprehensive peace deal to end their long-standing conflict is within reach, but previous talks had failed to reach consensus on a draft agreement. ""The negotiation process on the text of the peace agreement with Armenia has been concluded,"" Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov told reporters. Armenia's foreign ministry later confirmed that in a statement, saying: ""Negotiations on the draft agreement have been concluded"" and ""the Peace Agreement is ready for signing."" Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan hailed it as an ""important event"", saying Yerevan was ""ready to begin discussions on the place and time for signing the peace agreement"". France's President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the announcement, writing on X that ""there are now no remaining obstacles to the signing of a peace treaty ... which should pave the way for a lasting peace in the South Caucasus."" But in a hint at enduring tensions, Armenia criticised Azerbaijan for making a statement unilaterally rather than issuing a joint one. Pashinyan has recognised Baku's sovereignty over Karabakh after three decades of Armenian separatist rule, a move seen as a crucial first step towards a normalisation of relations. Armenia also last year returned to Azerbaijan four border villages it had seized decades earlier. Nearly all ethnic Armenians – more than 100,000 people –fled Karabakh after its takeover by Baku. Tensions over the conflict have also driven a wedge between Armenia and Russia, with Yerevan accusing its ally of not doing enough to support it. Armenia last year suspended its participation in the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) over the bloc's failure to come to its aid in the conflict with Azerbaijan. Russia, the United States and the European Union have all tried to play a mediating role at various times in the conflict. Pashinyan said Thursday that two points in the draft peace agreement had remained unresolved up to now. One key issue was ""non-deployment of third-party forces"" along the countries' shared border, he said. There were also disagreements over plans for both sides to mutually withdraw legal cases from international judicial bodies. The two countries have been locked in legal battles at the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court and the European Court of Human Rights over allegations of rights violations committed before, during and after their armed conflicts. Azerbaijan's ""next expectation from Armenia is constitutional amendments"", Bayramov said. Baku is demanding that Armenia remove from its constitution a reference to its declaration of independence, which asserts territorial claims over Karabakh. Any such amendments to Armenia's constitution would require a referendum.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-trump-somaliland-sudan-somalia-575e03aaa0c487bae2fbadfdef8f5ca3,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials of three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for moving Palestinians uprooted from the Gaza Strip under President Donald Trump’s proposed postwar plan, American and Israeli officials told The Associated Press. The contacts with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland reflect the determination by the U.S. and Israel to press ahead with a plan that has been widely condemned and raised serious legal and moral issues. Because all three places are poor, and in some cases wracked by violence, the proposal also casts doubt on Trump’s stated goal of resettling Gaza’s Palestinians in a “beautiful area.” Officials from Sudan said they have rejected overtures from the U.S., while officials from Somalia and Somaliland told The Associated Press that they were not aware of any contacts. Under Trump’s plan, Gaza’s more than 2 million people would be permanently sent elsewhere. He has proposed the U.S. would take ownership of the territory, oversee a lengthy cleanup process and develop it as a real estate project. The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel’s ultranationalist fringe. But since Trump presented the idea at a White House meeting last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed it as a “ bold vision.” Palestinians in Gaza have rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have expressed vehement opposition and offered an alternative reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place. Rights groups have said forcing or pressuring the Palestinians to leave could be a potential war crime. Still, the White House says Trump “stands by his vision.” Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed the contacts with Somalia and Somaliland, while the Americans confirmed Sudan as well. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place. Separate outreach from the U.S. and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan alongside Netanyahu, according to the U.S. officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions. Israel and the U.S. have a variety of incentives — financial, diplomatic and security — to offer these potential partners. It is a formula that Trump used five years ago when he brokered the Abraham Accords — a series of mutually beneficial diplomatic accords between Israel and four Arab countries. The White House declined to comment on the outreach efforts. The offices of Netanyahu and Ron Dermer, the Israeli Cabinet minister and Netanyahu confidant who has been leading Israel’s postwar planning, also had no comment. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a longtime advocate of what he calls “voluntary” emigration of Palestinians, said this week that Israel is working to identify countries to take in Palestinians. He also said Israel is preparing a “very large emigration department” within its Defense Ministry. Here is a closer look at the places the officials say have been approached. Sudan The North African country was among the four Abraham Accord nations that agreed to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020. As part of the deal, the U.S. removed Sudan from its list of state supporters of terrorism, a move that gave the country access to international loans and global legitimacy. But relations with Israel never took off as Sudan plunged into civil war between government forces and the RSF paramilitary group. The conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the U.N. and rights groups. The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, and then-President Joe Biden’s administration in January said the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide. The U.S. and Israel would be hard-pressed to persuade Palestinians to leave Gaza, particularly to such a troubled country. But they could offer incentives to the Khartoum government, including debt relief, weapons, technology and diplomatic support. Two Sudanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter, confirmed that the Trump administration has approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians. One of them said the contacts began even before Trump’s inauguration with offers of military assistance against the RSF, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives. Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. “This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,” said one official. ”No one opened this matter again.” Military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan told an Arab leaders’ summit last week in Cairo that his country “categorically rejects” any plan that aims to transfer “the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name.” Somaliland Somaliland, a territory of over 3 million people in the Horn of Africa, seceded from Somalia over 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognized as an independent state. Somalia considers Somaliland part of its territory. Somaliland’s new president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, has made international recognition a priority. An American official involved in the efforts confirmed that the U.S. was “having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the U.S. in exchange for recognition.” The possibility of U.S. recognition could provide an incentive for Abdullahi to back away from the territory’s solidarity with the Palestinians. The United Arab Emirates, another Abraham Accord country that has developed strong ties with Israel, once had a military base in Somaliland and maintains commercial interests there, including a port. The territory’s strategic location, in the Gulf of Aden waterway near Yemen, home to the Houthi rebel group, could also make it a valuable ally. Over the years, Somaliland has been lauded for its relatively stable political environment, contrasting sharply with Somalia’s ongoing struggles amid deadly attacks by al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab. Since 1991, Somaliland has maintained its own government, currency and security structures. Still, it has one of the lowest income levels in the world. An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said his government has not been approached and is not in talks about taking in Palestinians. Somalia Somalia has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, often hosting peaceful protests on its streets in support of them. The country joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump’s plan and seems like an unlikely destination for Palestinians, even if they did agree to move. Sambu Chepkorir, a lawyer and conflict researcher in Nairobi, Kenya, said it is difficult to understand why Somalia would want to host Palestinians given the country’s strong support for Palestinian self-rule. “The realignments keep changing, and so maybe there is a hidden agenda,” Chepkorir said. A Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the country had not been approached about taking in Palestinians from Gaza and there had been no discussions about it. ___ Lee reported from Washington, and Magdy reported from Cairo.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250314000252315?section=national/diplomacy,"(ATTN: ADDS more details in paras 5-6; CHANGES photo)By Song Sang-ho WASHINGTON, March 13 (Yonhap) -- U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday expressed his desire to reestablish the relationship that he had with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during his first term, boasting that he ""got along great"" with the reclusive leader and still has a ""great"" relationship with him. During a press availability, Trump made the remarks, describing the North Korean leader as a ""nuclear power"" with ""a lot of nuclear weapons,"" as his administration is pursuing the goal of the ""complete denuclearization"" of North Korea. ""Well, I would,"" Trump said, responding to a reporter's question of whether he has a plan to reestablish the relationship he had under his first presidential mandate. ""I had a great relationship with Kim Jong-un (of) North Korea. If I wasn't elected, if Hillary got in, you would have had a nuclear war with North Korea,"" he added, as he sat next to North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House for talks. His remarks added to expectations that he would seek to revive his direct personal diplomacy with Kim, which led to three meetings between the two -- the first in Singapore in June 2018, another in Hanoi in February 2019 and the other in the inter-Korean truce village of Panmunjom in June 2019. Days after his inauguration in January, Trump said he will reach out to Kim again, calling the ruler a ""smart guy,"" though speculation persisted that Pyongyang's appetite for engagement with Washington might have lessened as it has relied on Moscow for food, fuel, military support and other help. Trump claimed he continues to maintain a good relationship with Kim. ""I have a great relationship with Kim Jong-un, and we'll see what happens,"" he said. ""But certainly, he's a nuclear power."" It is not the first time that he has depicted North Korea as a nuclear power -- a term that U.S. officials had mostly refrained from publicly using given that the term could be construed as a U.S. recognition of Pyongyang's possession of nuclear weapons. Shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 20, he used the term to refer to North Korea, spawning speculation about his intentions behind the nuclear power labeling. Speculation eased later as the White House said his administration is pursuing the complete denuclearization of North Korea. Highlighting his hope to bring down the number of nuclear weapons in the world, Trump pointed out North Korea's sizable nuclear arsenal. ""Kim Jong-un has a lot of nuclear weapons by the way ... a lot and others do also,"" he said. ""You have India. You have Pakistan. You have others that have them."" The president credited the first Trump administration with South Korea's successful hosting of the Olympics, where North Korea partook, apparently in reference to the PyeongChang Olympics held in February 2018. ""They (North Koreans) asked for a meeting. And then we met. And the meeting caused the Olympics, which was South Korea, to become a tremendous success,"" he said. ""Nobody was buying tickets for the Olympics because they didn't want to be nuked, and I met and not only did the Olympics become successful, but North Korea participated in the Olympics ... That was something that was an achievement of the Trump administration ... great achievement."" It is unclear what meeting he referred to as his first summit with Kim took place in June 2018 months after the Olympics. sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)","(2nd LD) Trump voices desire to reestablish ties with Kim Jong-un, says Kim has 'a lot of' nuclear arms",Song Sang-ho,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-14T06:31:14,2025-03-14T06:31:14,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20250313-trump-to-dr-congo-s-rescue-what-we-know-about-a-proposed-us-congolese-mining-deal,"The US and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo or DRC) may soon begin formal negotiations on a critical minerals deal. Discussions are under way, the Congolese presidency confirmed to FRANCE 24, on US access to the mineral resources of the vast central African country, which has some of the world's largest reserves of cobalt, coltan, copper and lithium that are vital for cutting-edge technologies in defence, energy transition and other sectors. The US State Department last week said it was open to a mining partnership in DR Congo and has confirmed that preliminary discussions had begun. Congolese authorities hope to block neighbouring Rwanda, which supports the M23 rebels and is accused of plundering their country's mineral resources. Since January, the armed group has been leading a major offensive in eastern DR Congo, which has put the Congolese army under considerable pressure. A Congolese offer to the US secretary of state The prospect of a minerals deal was first outlined by Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi in a February 22 interview with the New York Times. In his first interview since the launch of the 2025 M23 offensive, Tshisekedi “offered the United States and Europe a stake in his country’s vast mineral wealth, a sector currently dominated by China"", the US daily reported. The Congolese president had “pinned his hopes on Western pressure against Rwanda”, calculating that a deal could bring his country security and stability, said the report. Tshisekedi also told The New York Times that the Trump administration had “already shown interest in a deal that could ensure a stream of strategic minerals directly from Congo”. The interview was published a day after a US consultancy, commissioned by Congolese senator and Tshisekedi supporter Pierre Kanda Kalambayi, sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, offering a “strategic partnership” between the two countries. The letter proposed access to Congolese minerals, operational control of a deep-water port to serve as an export hub, and the establishment of a joint strategic mineral stockpile. In return, the US would train and equip Congolese armed forces to “protect mineral supply routes from foreign-backed militant groups”. The strengthened military cooperation could even replace MONUSCO, which the letter described as the “ineffective UN peacekeeping operations” in the central African nation. “Until we have proof to the contrary, this is not an official plan,” explained Jason K. Sterns, a leading US expert on the DR Congo. “Some points seem unrealistic, such as the deployment of American forces on the ground, which runs counter to [President] Donald Trump's promise to bring home the soldiers. But what is certain is that the Congolese army is in a weak position in the east and that the authorities are counting heavily on international pressure, particularly from the United States, to increase the pressure on Rwanda.”  Calls for transparency The possibility of a US-DR Congo agreement raises several questions. “This is symptomatic of the governance problems in our country,” said Jean Pierre Okenda, executive director of the Congolese NGO, La sentinelle des ressources naturelles. Okenda, a mining sector expert, expressed concerns that the negotiations, dictated by the DR Congo’s security emergency, may not benefit the Congolese economy. “Some people here think that the authorities are seeking above all to protect their power. Such an agreement should not be negotiated in backhanded deals, it should be submitted to parliament since it could have a major impact on the population,” he noted. Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya Katembwe claimed last week that the DR Congo was simply seeking to diversify its partners. Meanwhile a Congolese presidency spokesperson refuted the idea that the DR Congo was ready to trade its minerals for security support. “Setting the record straight: President Tshisekedi invites the USA, whose companies source strategic raw materials from Rwanda, materials that are looted from the DRC and smuggled to Rwanda while our populations are massacred, to purchase them directly from us the rightful owners,” said Tina Salama on X. When contacted by FRANCE 24, Salama asserted that Congolese Senator Kalambayi's move was a “personal initiative”. “We are seeking to stop the Rwandan predation of our resources,” she explained, holding out the hope that a strategic agreement with the US could help “stop the war”. Western hardening towards Rwanda Salama also made it clear that the initiative was specifically directed at the US “because what has been hidden and fostered for 30 years has just been revealed by Donald Trump's administration”. It was a reference to the US sanctions, announced on February 20, on James Kabarebe, Rwanda’s minister of state for regional integration, and Lawrence Kanyuka, spokesman for the M23 rebellion. “It's clear that the recent US sanctions are seen as an important step,” explained Okenda. “This is the first time a Rwandan minister has been directly targeted. What's more, this is just one stage in the sanctions that Washington could impose against Rwanda,” she noted. In its statement, the US Treasury Department described Kabarebe as “a Rwandan government liaison to M23” who has “coordinated the export of extracted minerals from mining sites in the DRC for eventual export from Rwanda”.  According to UN experts, the M23 levies substantial taxes on mining activities, generating around $800,000 a month from coltan taxation alone, in the Rubaya area of North Kivu, which it has controlled since May 2024. On February 21, the UN Security Council unanimously approved a resolution “strongly condemning” the M23 offensive in the DR Congo and the advances it is making in North and South Kivu provinces with the support of the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF). Read moreUN Security Council demands Rwanda withdraw troops from eastern DR Congo A snub to China Congolese appeals for Western mining investments are seen as a snub to China, which alone controls between 75 and 80% of mining operations in DR Congo, particularly in the copper and cobalt sectors. But this does not necessarily mean the Congolese president has made a diplomatic U-turn, according to Sterns. “Félix Tshisekedi has always had a tendency to look to the West, he has spent much of his life in Belgium and was supported by the United States during his disputed election in 2018,” he noted. Since coming to power, the Congolese president has made two bilateral visits to China, aimed at developing, but also rebalancing, the partnership with Beijing. In January 2024, he concluded the renegotiation of a major mining agreement between the DRC and a Chinese consortium dubbed “the contract of the century”. Originally signed in 2008 under then-president Joseph Kabila, the renegotiation was meant to yield additional benefits for the DRC. But it failed to appease many Congolese and was slammed by NGOs and civil society groups. “China has not respected its part of the 2008 agreement concerning its infrastructure investments. On the ground, there is no real engagement with local communities, and Chinese companies have no regard for workers' rights or respect for the environment,” said Okenda. “Today, many of these workers think, rightly or wrongly, that it would be better to deal with the US.” An American mirage? Inspired by the much-discussed, but yet to be signed Ukraine-US mining deal, the Congolese counterpart has several attractions for Washington DC. It presents a nod to Trump's “America first” agenda, while countering the interests of his rival, China. But operationally, such a project presents enormous challenges, warns Okenda. “Most of the mining concessions have already been handed over to private companies in the southeast of the country, the part richest in copper, cobalt and lithium ores. This seems to leave little room for a large-scale agreement with the US. Of course, many exploration projects are under way. But they represent huge investments, with no guarantees on arrival, which are not factored into the balance when it comes to obtaining emergency security aid,” he noted. Negotiations with Washington DC seem even more risky given that no US mining company currently operates in the DRC. The last American venture on Congolese soil left a sour taste and bad memories in the central African country. Freeport-McMoRan's departure caused a stir in 2016, when the company was accused of selling its assets to a Chinese company without consulting Congolese authorities. Nonetheless, the US retains an interest in DR Congo's mining resources. This was demonstrated by former president Joe Biden's active support for the Lobito Corridor, a rail project designed to link the mines of northern Zambia and southeastern DRC to the Angolan port of Lobito, in order to strengthen US supplies and counteract Chinese influence. “US mining companies could return to DR Congo as a result of the current discussions. But the idea that the United States could seriously compete with or even replace China is a fallacy, as it no longer possesses the industrial capacities for metal processing and refining that Beijing does,” explained Sterns.   Behind the scenes, however, Congolese and US officials are busy trying to find common ground. On Tuesday, Congolese presidential spokeswoman Salama welcomed the fact that “discussions are going well”, while explaining that she wanted to “wait until they are concluded before revealing their content”. Salama also confirmed reports that André Wameso, Tshisekedi’s deputy chief of staff, had visited Washington in early March, accompanied by a delegation. Congolese government spokesman Katembwe explained last week that “daily exchanges” were taking place with the US. For his part, Trump is reportedly preparing to appoint a special envoy to the Great Lakes region, tasked with a priority mission to study Congolese mineral deals. US reports say Massad Boulos, whose son Michael is married to Trump’s daughter Tiffany, has been picked for the job.

https://apnews.com/article/brussels-european-parliament-arrests-corruption-belgium-bribery-b02bc4aa12f312dcbd360070f3853c1b,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgian federal prosecutors on Thursday announced the arrests of several people in a corruption probe linked to the European Parliament and the Chinese company Huawei, which is suspected of bribing EU lawmakers. The arrests came as an investigation by Le Soir newspaper and other media said lobbyists working for the Chinese telecoms giant were suspected of bribing current or former European Parliament members to promote the company’s commercial policies in Europe. The prosecutor’s office confirmed in a statement that the alleged bribery “is said to have benefited Huawei.” About 100 federal police officers carried out 21 searches in Brussels, the Flanders and Wallonia regions, and Portugal. The investigating magistrate in charge of the case also asked for seals to be placed on offices inside the EU Parliament allocated to two parliamentary assistants allegedly involved. Prosecutors said one person was arrested in France. The suspects would be questioned over “alleged involvement in active corruption within the European Parliament, as well as for forgery and use of forgeries,” prosecutors said. “The offences were allegedly committed by a criminal organization.” The company said in a statement that “Huawei takes these allegations seriously and will urgently communicate with the investigation to further understand the situation.” “Huawei has a zero tolerance policy towards corruption or other wrongdoing, and we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations at all times,” it added. The European Parliament said only that the assembly “takes note of the information” and “always cooperates fully with the judicial authorities.” Huawei, which makes cellphones and is the biggest maker of networking gear for phone and internet carriers, has been caught in tensions between the United States and China over technology and trade. Some European nations have followed Washington’s lead and banned Huawei’s equipment from next-generation mobile networks over allegations that it poses a security risk that could help facilitate Chinese spying. The company has repeatedly denied this. European Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said the EU’s executive branch had no comment regarding the investigation but underlined the commission’s security concerns about Huawei and Europe’s fifth-generation mobile phone networks. “The security of our 5G networks is obviously crucial for our economy,” Regnier told reporters. “Huawei represents materially higher risks than other 5G suppliers.” EU member states should swiftly “adopt decisions to restrict or to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks,” Regnier said. “A lack of swift action would expose the EU as a whole to a clear risk.” The prosecutor’s office said it believes there was corruption “from 2021 to the present day” in various forms, “such as remuneration for taking political positions or excessive gifts such as food and travel expenses or regular invitations to football matches.” Prosecutors also believe payments might have been disguised as business expenses and in some cases may have been directed to third parties. They said they would also look to “detect any evidence of money laundering.” Police seized several documents and objects during the searches. Staff at Huawei’s offices in Brussels declined to comment and turned the lights off inside to avoid photographs taken through the window. This is the second corruption case targeting the EU Parliament in less than three years. In December 2022, the legislature was shaken by a corruption scandal in which Qatari officials were accused of bribing EU officials to play down labor rights concerns ahead of the soccer World Cup. The scandal scarred the reputation of the EU’s only institution comprised of officials elected directly in the 27 member countries. It undermined the assembly’s claim to the moral high ground in its own investigations, such as into allegations of corruption in member country Hungary. EU Greens lawmaker Daniel Freund — who supervised the work of the assembly’s ethics body during the scandal, dubbed Qatargate — said Thursday the parliament’s reputation is again under threat. “The risk of corruption in Brussels is high because the EU is so influential,” he said. “We need a complete investigation quickly, and finally reforms that will make the Parliament more resistant to corruption.” According to Follow The Money, an investigative journalism platform, one of the main suspects in the probe is 41-year-old Valerio Ottati, a Belgian-Italian lobbyist who joined Huawei in 2019. Before becoming Huawei’s EU public affairs director, Ottati was an assistant to two Italian MEPs who were both members of a European Parliament group dealing with China policy, Follow the Money reported. ___ Petrequin reported from Paris.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/witkoff-reportedly-presents-new-proposal-for-gaza-truce-extension-to-israel-hamas/,"After arriving in Doha earlier this week, US special envoy Steve Witkoff presented Israel and Hamas with a new outline to extend the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip by several weeks in exchange for Hamas releasing five living and 10 dead hostages, according to reports on Thursday. The reports on the new proposal drew concern from the families of the hostages, who said the deal, if agreed upon, would leave many of their loved ones in captivity for a “long and undetermined length of time.” Fifty-nine hostages are still held in Gaza, with 24 of them believing to be alive. The existence and details of the new US outline were first reported by Axios, which cited sources familiar with the matter. The proposal, which differs from a previous outline put forward by Witkoff, would extend the current ceasefire by several weeks, until the end of both Ramadan and Passover, in exchange for the release of additional hostages, according to the Axios report. At the same time, Israel would also be required to resume the flow of humanitarian aid into the war-torn Palestinian enclave. Hebrew media outlets reported later Thursday that the US proposal provides for five living and 10 dead hostages to be returned, and extending the ceasefire for a further 42-50 days. Citing two unnamed sources, Axios reported that the extension, should all parties agree to implement it, would give the US additional time to negotiate a more concrete, long-term truce agreement. Should a long-term ceasefire agreement be reached, the report said that Hamas would be required to hand over all remaining hostages, living and dead, on the last day of the temporary truce extension, before the concrete ceasefire came into effect. Israel gave “a positive response” to Witkoff’s latest proposal, the Axios report said, while Qatar and Egypt were still awaiting Hamas’s response after delivering the details of the outline to the terror group on Wednesday night. According to a Channel 12 report late Thursday, Israel has demanded that a larger number of living hostages be freed. Hamas, for its part, has demanded that the US guarantee that there will be discussions on phase two of the current deal, which provides for the full withdrawal of the IDF and the end of the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to hold negotiations on the second phase despite the agreement’s stipulations. Netanyahu will reportedly convene top aides and security chiefs on Saturday night for a “situational assessment” on the latest developments of the hostage talks in Doha, and if no breakthrough is achieved by then, the premier will bring his negotiating team home. If the sides cannot reach an agreement based on the new Witkoff proposal, the Channel 12 report said that mediators were expected to push Israel and Hamas toward a smaller interim arrangement, under which a “solitary few” living hostages would be freed and the ceasefire maintained. The purpose of the smaller arrangement would be to buy more time for negotiations and avoid the complete collapse of the talks and a return to fighting. In the course of the extended ceasefire, discussions would take place on “final summations” — an apparent reference to the end of the war. “If there is no progress in the next 48 hours, the Israeli delegation will return to Israel,” Channel 12 quoted a senior Israeli source as saying. The network also said that Israel’s demand for Hamas leaders to go into exile is “off the agenda” given the “stubborn opposition” from Hamas’s leaders in Gaza, quoting sources in Israel’s negotiating team as saying the demand was not going to be raised as an option in the ongoing talks. However, Netanyahu’s office firmly denied that claim, calling it “fake news,” saying Israel still wants Hamas’s Gaza leaders sent into exile while confirming that the prime minister is open to extending safe passage abroad for them. “Fake news once again,” the Prime Minister’s Office said. “In contrast to the false report from Channel 12 this evening, the exile of senior Hamas officials has not been taken off the agenda.” Following the flurry of reports, the families of the Gaza hostages expressed “serious concerns” about Witkoff’s proposal, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. “The reports about the outline for the return of just a few hostages raise serious concerns among the families of the hostages that their loved ones will be left in captivity for a long and undetermined length of time,” the forum said. The forum demanded a “comprehensive and immediate agreement that will return all 59 hostages in one fell swoop and leave nobody behind.” “Otherwise, the living hostages who remain in the tunnels will be sentenced to death, and we will not be able to locate and return the dead for burial,” it added. MK Benny Gantz, who heads the opposition National Unity party, expressed similar concerns, saying that Netanyahu was either making “concessions” to Hamas or “stalling.” “In the first hostage outline, we returned 10 living hostages per day; in the current outline, four per week, and now we are discussing a plan to return five live hostages per month,” he said. “The conclusion is simple — either Netanyahu is making concessions, or Netanyahu is stalling,” Gantz wrote, adding that “Israel’s interest is to return all the hostages as quickly as possible.” “What is happening now is that Netanyahu is allowing Hamas to rehabilitate instead of dismantling it, endangering the hostages instead of returning them, and preserving his coalition instead of national interests,” he concluded. Hamas has so far released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire that began in January. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. Eight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014. The body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas and is counted among the 59 hostages.","Witkoff reportedly presents new proposal for Gaza truce extension to Israel, Hamas",ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-03-13T21:28:13,2025-03-13T21:28:13,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/greenland-election-demokraatit-trump-arctic-13c295cbc716db2c8011be5819e11fef,"NUUK, Greenland (AP) 
— Greenland’s likely new prime minister on Wednesday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to take control of the island, saying Greenlanders must be allowed to decide their own future as it moves toward independence from Denmark. Jens-Frederik Nielsen’s Demokraatit, a pro-business party that favors a slow path to independence, won a surprise victory in Tuesday’s parliamentary election, outpacing the two left-leaning parties that formed the last government. With most Greenlanders opposing Trump’s overtures, the campaign focused more on issues like healthcare and education than on geopolitics. But on Wednesday Nielsen was quick to push back against Trump, who last week told a joint session of Congress that the U.S. needed Greenland to protect its own national security interests and he expected to get it “one way or the other.” “We don’t want to be Americans. No, we don’t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders, and we want our own independence in the future,” Nielsen, 33, told Britain’s Sky News. “And we want to build our own country by ourselves.” That didn’t stop Trump from suggesting during a Thursday Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte that Greenland’s election that it was “very good” for “us” and “the person who did the best is a very good person, as far as we’re concerned.” Greenland, a self-governing region of Denmark, has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009, when the government in Copenhagen recognized its right to self-determination under international law. Four of the five main parties in the election supported independence, though they disagreed on when and how to achieve it. The island of 56,000 people, most from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds, has attracted international attention since Trump announced his designs on it soon after returning to the White House in January. Trump is focused on Greenland because it straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and is home to the U.S.’s Pituffik Space Base, which supports missile warning and space surveillance operations. Greenland also has large deposits of the rare-earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology. Trump said during the meeting with Rutte that “Denmark’s very far away” from Greenland and questioned whether that country still had a right to claim the world’s largest island as part of its kingdom. “A boat landed there 200 years ago or something. And they say they have rights to it,” Trump said. “I don’t know if that’s true. I don’t think it is, actually.” Trump said U.S. control of Greenland could be important for national security reasons and even suggested NATO should be involved, but Rutte demurred. Trump nonetheless noted that the U.S. already has a considerable military presence in Greenland and added, “Maybe you’ll see more and more soldiers going there. I don’t know.” Despite that, Trump’s overtures weren’t on the ballot. The 31 men and women elected to parliament on Tuesday will have to set priorities for issues such as diversifying Greenland’s economy, building infrastructure and improving health care, as well as shaping the country’s strategy for countering the president’s America First agenda. Demokraatit won 29.9% of the vote by campaigning to improve housing and educational standards while delaying independence until Greenland is self-sufficient. Four years ago, the party finished in fourth place with 9.1%. Nuuk resident Anthon Nielsen said the party’s victory would be good for the country. “Most politicians want Greenland to be independent,” he said. “But this party who won, they don’t want to hurry things so everything must be done right.” Carina Ren, head of the Arctic program at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, said the results show that Greenlanders tried to ignore Trump and focus on issues that were important to them. “The voters have been able to drag down all the drama, all the alarmist talk from the outside to say, ‘Well, this is about our everyday lives, our everyday concerns as citizens. Where are we going, how are we going to develop our society from the inside.’” Now Demokraatit will have to turn its attention to forming a governing coalition. Naleraq, the most aggressively pro-independence party, finished in second place, with 24.5% of the vote. It was followed by Inuit Ataqatigiit, which led the last government, at 21.4%. “What approach to independence will win the day will ultimately depend on if Demokraatit decides to form a coalition government, and if so, with which party,” said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative. Nielsen appeared to be surprised by Demokraatit’s gains as the results came it, with photos showing him sporting a huge grin and applauding at a post-election party. He later said Demokraatit would reach out to all the other parties to negotiate Greenland’s future political course. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen congratulated Demokraatit and warned that Greenland’s new government would likely have to “deal with massive pressure” from Trump. “It’s not the case that you can just take part of the Danish Realm,” Danish broadcaster DR quoted him as saying. “The future of Greenland is based on what the Greenlandic people and government want.” Greenland Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede last month called early elections, saying the country needed to be united during a “serious time” unlike anything Greenland has ever experienced. On Wednesday, after the results were known, Egede used a Facebook post to thank voters for turning out and said the parties were ready to turn to negotiations to form a government. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Washington.", Greenland elections: Center-right Demokraatit Party wins most votes,Danica Kirka,AP News,2025-03-12T05:36:07,2025-03-13T14:45:38,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/13/trumps-steel-aluminium-tariffs-how-are-targeted-countries-responding?traffic_source=rss,"Some countries are fighting back with retaliatory tariffs, others are seeking exemptions and are trying to negotiate. President Donald Trumpâ	ms tariffs on the imports of steel and aluminium by the United States are sending shockwaves through global markets and escalating tensions with key trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Some countries are fighting back with retaliatory tariffs, others are seeking exemptions, and a few are trying to negotiate their way out of the 25 percent tariffs. So, who is escalating the trade war, who is trying to avoid it, and what does this mean for the industries that rely on these metals? Canada, Brazil, and Mexico are the top three suppliers of steel to the US, collectively accounting for about 49 percent of its imports between March 2024 and January 2025, according to the International Trade Administration. The remaining leading suppliers are South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Germany, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and China, which together make up 30 percent of US steel imports. Here is a breakdown: For aluminium, the biggest suppliers are Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Mexico. Canada is the dominant supplier, responsible for nearly 40 percent of US aluminium imports, followed by the UAE, Russia and Mexico. The tariff war will have a widespread effect on manufacturers and consumers in the US as steel and aluminium are crucial in the making of home appliances, cars, planes, phones and buildings, among others. Steel is a backbone material for construction, manufacturing, transport, and energy, with the construction sector using one-third of all steel imports. It will push up costs for infrastructure projects, including airports, schools and roads. Aluminium, being lightweight and corrosion-resistant, is essential for the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as food and beverage packaging. The US is particularly dependent on aluminium imports, with roughly half of the metal used in the country coming from foreign sources. The US import of steel and aluminium last year was $31bn and $27bn, respectively, according to the US Department of Commerce data. Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, said the tariffs are especially damaging because there is â	clittle economic or genuine national security rationale for themâ	. â	The US canâ	 realistically onshore enough of these commodities, so the duties mainly create economic pain for American consumers and key trading partners,â	 Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera. They instead introduce a level of â	unpredictability and volatility we havenâ	 seen in decadesâ	. By undermining established trade norms, the US â	effectively encourages other nations to respond in kind, with devastating impact for the stock markets and investor and consumer confidence across North America and beyondâ	, Nadjibulla said. The biggest steel and aluminium supplier to the US has taken a strong stance against the tariffs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the tariffs â	unjustifiableâ	 and a â	cdumb thing to doâ	. Canada announced 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on $20.6bn worth of US goods, including $8.8bn on steel and $2bn in aluminium imports. It has also imposed an additional tariff of nearly $10bn on US goods such as computers and servers, display monitors, water heaters and sports equipment, among others. These countermeasures take effect on Thursday. â	We are going to stand up for our workers, and we are going to make sure the American people understand that their leadershipâ	ms decisions have consequences,â	 Trudeau said earlier this week. Mark Carney, who will succeed Trudeau as prime minister, has pledged to maintain the tariffs until the US commits to fair trade practices. He said he is willing to take â	ca much more comprehensive approach for tradeâ	. â	We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,â	 he said on Wednesday. The latest tariffs are in addition to the 25 percent counter-tariffs on $20.8bn of US imports, imposed on March 4 in retaliation to the previous Trump levy that has since been delayed by a month. The EU has also announced retaliatory measures targeting more than $28bn worth of US goods such as motorcycles, peanut butter, and jeans, among others. These measures will roll out in two phases: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned that these tariffs will increase prices and threaten jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. â	We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and even worse for consumers,â	 she said, adding that the EU â	will always remain open to negotiationâ	. Mexicoâ	ms response remains unclear. President Claudia Sheinbaum has indicated that any retaliatory tariffs would be implemented only if negotiations fail. However, she has already struck a temporary waiver deal with Trump, securing an exemption until April 2 for Mexican imports under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade agreement signed under Trumpâ	ms first term. However, analysts say goods that do not comply with the USMCA could still attract the new 25 percent tariffs. This comes after Mexico and Canada negotiated a one-month delay in the tariffs, during which both countries agreed to boost border security measures. Trump has followed through with his campaign promise to impose tariffs on Mexico until it stopped immigration and drug trafficking through its borders. Despite being one of the hardest-hit nations, Brazil has chosen diplomacy over retaliation. Brazilian officials are engaging in talks with Washington in hopes of securing an exemption. The government led by left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued a statement regretting the â	unjustifiableâ	 move by the US. â	President Lula told us to remain calm, noting that in the past we have negotiated under conditions that were even more unfavourable than the current ones,â	 Finance Minister Fernando Haddad told reporters on Wednesday. Trump has accused South Korea of taking advantage of the US, adding that Seoulâ	ms average tariff is four times higher, without providing proof. The trade between the two close allies is almost tariff-free due to a free trade agreement. â	And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea. But thatâ	ms what happens,â	 Trump said during his address to the US Congress earlier this month. He also promised to scrap the CHIPS and Science Act, under which several Korean companies, including Samsung Electronics, receive US assistance. South Korea has opted for negotiation rather than confrontation. It has also activated a â	full emergency response modeâ	 to protect local industries. On Tuesday, South Koreaâ	ms acting President Choi Sang-mok said Trumpâ	ms â	America Firstâ	 policy had started targeting his country. South Korean officials have actively sought dialogue with their US counterparts to negotiate potential exemptions and address mutual concerns. Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo is scheduled to visit Washington, DC, on March 13-14, aiming to discuss reciprocal tariffs and investment opportunities. The visit seeks to influence the Trump administrationâ	ms trade policy report and to present South Koreaâ	ms stance on tariffs. Beijing is not a leading steel supplier to the US. However, it has taken the tariffs as a direct economic attack and responded aggressively. Mao Ning, spokesperson at the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters the move was in violation of World Trade Organization rules, and that China, the worldâ	ms largest steel producer and the second-largest economy, will take all necessary measures to safeguard its rights and interests. â	No one wins in a trade war or a tariff war,â	 the spokesperson said. China has already slapped tariffs on the US in retaliation to the 20 percent blanket tariff imposed by Trump. Australia, another key US ally which has been affected by Trumpâ	ms tariffs, said it would not retaliate. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the tariff â	centirely unjustifiedâ	, but ruled out reciprocal tariffs as it would affect Australian consumers. Canberra had managed to get an exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs under Trumpâ	ms first term. According to Nadjibulla, these tariffs paint an image that the US is becoming â	can unreliable partner for its closest alliesâ	. She said countries such as Canada, Australia, and South Korea â	will look to minimise their vulnerabilitiesâ	 and pursue strategies like diversifying trade partners. â	When large economies engage in tit-for-tat tariff escalations, the risk of a global trade slowdown looms larger,â	 she said. â	These measures donâ	 just hurt the near-term bottom line â	 they threaten the entire framework of open trade that has underpinned much of the worldâ	ms economic growth and stability.â	 Follow Al Jazeera English:","Trump’s steel, aluminium tariffs: How are targeted countries responding?",Al Jazeera,Al Jazeera,2025-03-13T10:16:44Z,2025-03-13T19:27:30Z,gemini-2.0-flash

The Russia-Ukraine war is on the agenda Thursday as foreign ministers from the G7 group of leading industrial nations meet in Canada amid a push to secure a ceasefire in the conflict. The talks in Quebec follow U.S.-Ukraine talks that included a U.S. proposal for ""an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire,"" which Ukrainian leaders said they were ready to accept. ""We must move toward peace. We must move toward security guarantees,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during his nightly address Wednesday. ""The key factor is our partners’ ability to ensure Russia’s readiness not to deceive but to genuinely end the war."" The Kremlin has said it was waiting to hear about the ceasefire proposal from U.S. officials. The White House said Wednesday that national security adviser Steve Witkoff was heading to Moscow for talks in the coming days. The G7 talks bring together ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly, who is hosting the meetings, said Canada welcomes the U.S. proposal to halt the fighting in Ukraine and that a ceasefire is ""the first step toward a just and lasting peace."" ""The ball is now in Russia’s court to show that it is likewise ready for a ceasefire and to put an end to the bloodshed. The world is watching,"" Joly said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters en route to Canada on Wednesday that the U.S. will have ""multiple points of contact"" with Russia to assess its willingness for the peace deal. ""Now, we all eagerly await the Russian response, and urge them strongly to consider ending all hostilities … so a process can begin to find a permanent peace,"" Rubio told VOA on Wednesday. Rubio added there is a need for monitors if Russia agrees to a ceasefire. ""If they [Russians] say yes, one of the things we'll have to determine is who do both sides trust to be on the ground to sort of monitor some of the small arms fire and exchanges that could happen,"" Rubio told reporters. At the White House on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said it was ""up to Russia now"" to respond. ""And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia,"" he said. ""And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished."" Trump is hosting NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for talks Thursday at the White House.

The ministry noted that the transfer was carried out in conjunction with Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze in Israel. Most of the packages were transported to As-Suwayda, while others were delivered to Druze communities near the border with Israel. The packages include basic food supplies, such as salt, oil, flour, and rice. ""We have a bold alliance with our Druze brothers. It is a privilege to help them,"" Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar noted. In a region in which we will always be a minority, it is both necessary and the right thing to do to assist other minorities,"" he added. The move comes as Israel has been in contact with Syrian Druze leaders, promising to protect them from harm following the toppling of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad by Â
Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the subsequent ascension to power of Ahmed al-Sharaa. On March 1,Defense Minister Israel Katzand Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement saying, ""We will not allow the terrorist regime of radical Islam in Syria to harm the Druze."" ""If the regime harms the Druze, it will be harmed by us. We are committed to our Druze brothers in Israel to do everything to prevent harm to their Druze brothers in Syria, and we will take all necessary steps to maintain their security.""

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250313002400320,"SEOUL, March 13 (Yonhap) -- Acting President Choi Sang-mok on Thursday directed officials to take measures to prevent any possible disruption in the domestic market caused by a sudden rise in steel products that have failed to be shipped to the United States due to increased tariffs. The U.S.' sweeping 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all countries took effect as President Donald Trump pushed for increased levies on the metals to bolster domestic manufacturing. During a meeting with ministers and officials, Choi emphasized the need to prioritize negotiations with Washington while ensuring that the sudden surplus of steel does not flood the domestic market. Given the significant potential impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) dealing with steel and aluminum-related products, Choi directed authorities to provide tailored support measures. Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals while also raising aluminum tariffs from 10 percent. His latest move, based on a directive issued in February, is expected to disrupt and reshape the global trade landscape. khj@yna.co.kr(END)",Acting president orders measures to prevent market disruption from 'unexported' steel,Kim Han-joo,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-13T09:36:56,2025-03-13T09:36:56,gemini-2.0-flash

Last Thursday, two KF-16 fighter jets dropped eight MK-82 bombs outside a training range in Pocheon, some 40 kilometers north of Seoul, during live-fire drills, injuring 38 people, including 24 civilians. ""The Criminal Investigation Command has confirmed in the probe to date that the pilots' erroneous entry of target coordinates was the direct cause of the accident,"" the defense ministry said in a notice to reporters.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) The pilots, booked as of Thursday, have been charged with professional negligence resulting in injury, according to the ministry. In an interim probe released Monday, the Air Force pointed to pilot error for the accidental bombing, saying the pilots had at least three opportunities to catch their mistake after entering the wrong target coordinates prior to takeoff. The Air Force also attributed the accident to inadequate management and inspection procedures and dismissed two unit commanders over their failure to give specific instructions to their subordinates. mlee@yna.co.kr(END)",Two Air Force pilots booked over accidental fighter jet bombing,Lee Minji,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-13T10:01:10,2025-03-13T10:01:10,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y02jexjxxo,"Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected the idea of negotiations with the US over its nuclear programme, as Tehran confirmed receiving a letter from President Donald Trump. Last week, Trump said the letter proposed talks on a deal that would prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons and avert possible military action. Although Khamenei said he had not seen the letter, which was delivered by an official from the United Arab Emirates, he dismissed it as a ""deception of public opinion"". ""When we know they won't honour it, what's the point of negotiating?"" he asked, referring to Trump's decision to abandon the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal during his first term. He warned that Iran would retaliate in the event of strikes on its nuclear facilities. ""Iran is not seeking war, but if the Americans or their agents take a wrong step, our response will be decisive and certain, and the one who will suffer the most harm is America,"" he said. The supreme leader, who has the final say on all state matters, also reiterated that Iran was ""not interested in nuclear weapons"". Ten years ago, the country agreed a historic deal with six world powers - China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US - to limit its nuclear activities and allow monitoring by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in return for sanctions relief. However, Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the accord in 2018 and reinstated crippling US economic sanctions. He labelled it ""the worst deal in history"", saying it did too little to stop Iran's potential pathway to building a nuclear bomb. Iran responded by increasingly breaching the terms of the deal, particularly those limiting the production of enriched uranium, which can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants but also to build nuclear weapons. The IAEA said last month that Iran had stockpiled almost 275kg (606lb) of uranium enriched to 60% purity, which is near weapons grade. That would theoretically be enough, if enriched to 90%, for six nuclear bombs. Both the US and Israel have warned that they will never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Israel has threatened to strike Iranian nuclear facilities if necessary. Last year, Israel said it hit part of Iran's nuclear programme during strikes that it carried out in response to an Iranian missile attack. In a TV interview broadcast last Friday, Trump said: ""There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal. I would prefer to make a deal, because I'm not looking to hurt Iran. They're great people."" ""I have written them a letter saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate,' because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for them,"" he added. The White House has not given any details about the contents of the letter, which Iran said was handed to Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi by UAE presidential adviser Anwar Gargash. Although the supreme leader dismissed the idea of negotiations with the US, Iran's mission to the UN did say in a statement on Sunday that it might consider talks ""if the objective is... to address concerns vis-Ã	-vis any potential militarisation of Iran's nuclear programme"". Araqchi also said on Wednesday that nuclear talks with the UK, France and Germany were ""ongoing"", while the Chinese foreign ministry said China, Russia and Iran would discuss the ""Iranian nuclear issue"" at a trilateral meeting in Beijing on Friday.",Iran rejects nuclear talks as UAE delivers Trump's letter,David Gritten,BBC News,2025-03-12T16:58:48,2025-03-12T16:58:48,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/un-reform-initiative-funding-challenges-guterres-trump-6c8318f9a129064ec69a179244ce4a3e,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. chief launched a new initiative Wednesday to reform the United Nations as it approaches its 80th anniversary, saying the 193-member global organization needs an urgent update to deal with major funding reductions and still tackle the world’s challenges. Secretary-General António Guterres dismissed any relationship between his UN80 Initiative and cuts to foreign aid and other programs that U.S. President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk say will make the U.S. government more efficient. “We are talking about completely different processes, methodologies and objectives,” Guterres told reporters. “This is a continuation and an intensification of work that we have always been doing.” He said the U.N. initiative’s objective will be to present member states with proposals for improving the way the organization works, reviewing the increasing number of mandates from the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly, and making structural changes to streamline operations. One key problem is that while the secretary-general is the U.N.’s chief executive, power rests with the 193 member nations that have very different ideas about the U.N. and the world. The United Nations also has faced sharp criticism for its failure to preserve international peace and security — its key mission — with critics pointing to the wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and Congo, to name a few. The U.N. has been key to providing humanitarian aid to millions of people and for its work helping refugees and children. Trump signed an executive order saying some U.N. agencies and bodies have drifted from their mission to promote peace and prevent future global conflicts and ordered a review of their operations. “I’ve always felt that the U.N. has tremendous potential,” Trump has said. “It’s not living up to that potential right now. ... They’ve got to get their act together.” Stressing that the United Nations reflects the world, Guterres said these are times of intense uncertainty and unpredictability. He said the U.N.’s work is affected by multiplying conflicts, inadequate progress in reducing poverty, widespread flouting of international law, violations of human rights and the lack of guardrails for new technologies, including artificial intelligence — to name a few. “And all of them are aggravated by major reductions of funding for humanitarian aid and development cooperation,” the secretary-general said. “In many cases, these obstacles are fueling dangerous levels of geopolitical tensions and divisions.” Guterres didn’t name any countries, but the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was in charge of humanitarian aid, and cut 83% of USAID’s programs. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, also are reducing humanitarian aid. He said the U.N.’s resources have been shrinking, pointing to its liquidity crisis for at least the past seven years because not all member states pay their yearly dues, and many don’t pay on time. Guterres said the UN80 Initiative is not only about reforming the U.N. but about “better serving people whose very lives depend on us” and “taxpayers around the world who underwrite everything we do.” The initiative will cover not only the U.N. Secretariat but all its funds and agencies and offices in Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna. It will be led by U.N. Undersecretary-General for Policy Guy Ryder, who will head a task force of top officials from the U.N. system, Guterres said. The U.N. budget for 2025, which was adopted last December, is $3.72 billion. The U.S., with the world’s biggest economy, is expected to pay 22%. China, with the second-largest economy, just had its share raised to 20%. Guterres said he hopes to move as soon as possible to take action in areas where he has authority and will urge member states “to consider the many decisions that rest with them.”",UN launches reform initiative as it nears its 80th anniversary and faces funding cuts,Edith M.

https://apnews.com/article/trump-eu-tariffs-countermeasures-806a3b9bcc9cd4e45817e672d95f0070,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Major trade partners swiftly hit back at President Donald Trump’s increased tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, imposing stiff new taxes on U.S products from textiles and water heaters to beef and bourbon. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminum to the U.S., said Wednesday it will place 25% reciprocal tariffs on steel products and also raise taxes on a host of items: tools, computers and servers, display monitors, sports equipment, and cast-iron products. Steel on coil cars ahead of transport at the main factory of struggling steel producer thyssenkrupp in Duisburg, Germany, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025. (AP Photo Meissner, File) Across the Atlantic, the European Union will raise tariffs on American beef, poultry, bourbon and motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans. Combined, the new tariffs will cost companies billions of dollars, and further escalate the uncertainty in two of the world’s major trade partnerships. Companies will either take the losses and earn fewer profits, or, more likely, pass costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices. Prices will go up, in Europe and the United States, and jobs are at stake, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers,” von der Leyen said. President Donald Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising that the taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown. The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. EU officials have made clear that the tariffs — taxes on imports — are aimed at products made in Republican-held states, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska and wood products from Alabama and Georgia. The tariffs will also hit blue states such as Illinois, the No. 1 U.S. producer of soybeans, which are also on the list. Spirits producers have becomecollateral damagein the dispute over steel and aluminum. The EU move “is deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild U.S. spirits exports in EU countries,” said Chris Swonger, head of the Distilled Spirits Council. The EU is a major destination for U.S. whiskey, with exports surging 60% in the past three years after an earlier set of tariffs was suspended. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the world’s biggest trading bloc, the EU, was expecting U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Von der Leyen said in a statement that the EU “will always remain open to negotiation.” Canada’s incomingPrime Minister Mark Carneysaid Wednesday he’s ready to meet with Trump if he shows “respect for Canadian sovereignty″ and is willing to take ”a common approach, a much more comprehensive approach for trade.″ Carney, who will be sworn in Friday, said workers in both countries will be better off when “the greatest economic and security partnership in the world is renewed, relaunched. That is possible.” “We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,” she said. The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures “will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.” “The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,” the chamber said Wednesday.

TheEU also imposed countermeasuresin retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items. This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First on April 1, the commission will reimpose taxes that were in effect from 2018 and 2020, but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.

(AP Photo Curtis) He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip “that the EU is not the problem.” “I argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,” Å efÄoviÄ told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Canada is imposing, as of 12:01 a.m. Thursday 25% reciprocal tariffs on steel products worth $12.6 billion Canadian (US$8.7 billion) and aluminum products worth $3 billion Canadian (US$2 billion) as well as additional imported U.S. goods worth $14.2 billion Canadian ($9.9 billion) for a total of $29.8 billion (US$20.6 billion.) The list of additional products affected by counter-tariffs includes tools, computers and servers, display monitors, water heaters, sport equipment, and cast-iron products. These tariffs are in addition to Canada’s 25% counter tariffs on $30 billion Canadian (US$20.8 billion) of imports from the U.S. that were put in place on March 4 in response to other Trump tariffs that he’s delayed by a month. The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports. The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services. ___ McHugh reported from Frankfurt and Gillies from Toronto.

https://apnews.com/article/kuwait-detainees-released-trump-united-states-f71e0c3fb7690926ac5c3678346fb54f,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Kuwait has released 10 American prisoners, including veterans and military contractors jailed for years on drug-related charges, in a move seen as a gesture of goodwill between two allies. “President Trump has made it a priority to bring home Americans detained overseas. We are pleased that Kuwait has released Americans from prison,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement Thursday that said the detained Americans had been pardoned by the country’s ruling emir in recognition of Kuwait’s National Day. “Kuwait is a vital ally in the region, and we look forward to continuing to work with Kuwait and other partners in these efforts across the world,” the spokesperson added. The statement confirms earlier Associated Press reporting about the releases that cited a representative for some of the 10 who were freed. The release follows a recent visit to the region by Adam Boehler, the Trump administration’s top hostage envoy, and comes amid a continued U.S. government push to bring home American citizens jailed in foreign countries. Six of the newly freed prisoners were accompanied Wednesday on a flight from Kuwait to New York by Jonathan Franks, a private consultant who works on cases involving American hostages and detainees and who had been in the country to help secure their release.

“My clients and their families are grateful to the Kuwaiti government for this kind humanitarian gesture,” Franks said in a statement. He said that his clients maintain their innocence and that additional Americans he represents also are expected to be released by Kuwait later. The names of the released prisoners were not immediately made public. Kuwait did not acknowledge the release on its state-run KUNA news agency and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and its upcoming Eid al-Fitr holiday typically see prisoner releases across Muslim-majority nations. Kuwait, a small, oil-rich nation that borders Iraq and Saudi Arabia and is near Iran, is considered a major non-NATO ally of the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio paid tribute to that relationship as recently as last month, when he said the U.S. “remains steadfast in its support for Kuwait’s sovereignty and the well-being of its people.”The countries have had a close military partnership since America launched the 1991 Gulf War to expel Iraqi troops after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded the country, with some 13,500 American troops stationed in Kuwait at Camp Arifjan and Ali al-Salem Air Base. But Kuwait has also detained many American military contractors on drug charges, in some cases, for years. Their families have alleged that their loved ones faced abuse while imprisoned in a country that bans alcohol and has strict laws regarding drugs. Others have criticized Kuwaiti police for bringing trumped-up charges and manufacturing evidence used against them — allegations never acknowledged by the autocratic nation ruled by a hereditary emir. The State Department warns travelers that drug charges in Kuwait can carry long prison sentences and the death penalty. Defense cooperation agreements between the U.S. and Kuwait likely include provisions that ensure U.S. troops are subject only to American laws, though that likely doesn’t include contractors.Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, his Republican administration has secured the release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel in a prisoner swap with Russia and has announced the release by Belarus of an imprisoned U.S. citizen.The Americans released Wednesday had not been designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained. The status is applied to a subsection of Americans jailed abroad and historically ensures the case is handled by the administration’s special presidential envoy for hostage affairs — the office that handles negotiations for a release. But advocates of those held in foreign countries are hopeful the Trump administration takes a more flexible approach and secures the release of those not deemed wrongfully detained.“The sad reality is that these Americans were left in prison for years due to a misguided policy that had, before President Trump took office, effectively abandoned Americans abroad who hadn’t been designated wrongfully detained,” Franks said in a statement.“These releases,” he added, “demonstrate what is achievable when the U.S. government prioritizes bringing Americans home.”___Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.",Kuwait frees jailed Americans held on drug charges,"ERIC TUCKER, JON GAMBRELL",AP News,2025-03-12T21:17:36,2025-03-13T17:40:02,gemini-2.0-flash

https://abc7.com/post/3-suspected-fentanyl-traffickers-arrested-charged-55-million-drug-bust-downey/16008095/,"DOWNEY, Calif. (CNS) --Authorities announced the arrests of three suspected fentanyl traffickers and the seizure of 14 million lethal doses of the drug with an estimated street value of about $55 million, along with heroin and methamphetamine. ""To say that this investigation has saved thousands of lives is an understatement,"" Downey Police Chief Scott Lougher said at a news conference in downtown Los Angeles Tuesday, where he was joined by State Attorney General Rob Bonta and Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman. Priscilla Gomez, 43, of Torrance; her brother, Gustavo Omar Gomez, 47, of Huntington Park; and Carlos Manuel Mariscal, 38, of Huntington Park, are facing felony counts in connection with the investigation, according to Hochman. Bonta said investigators had ""reliable information"" that led them to Priscilla Gomez, whom he described as a ""courier"" who was stopped by Downey police in a traffic stop. ""She acknowledged the possession of some drugs and also a K-9 was activated at the stop,"" the attorney general said. Investigators subsequently served a search warrant at an apartment in Downey, Hochman said. Downey police found more than 50 pounds of fentanyl and nearly 12 pounds of opium in a car and in the apartment Jan. 22, according to the District Attorney's Office. The attorney general said investigators also saw ""indicia of a Mexican cartel."" ""Some cartels are known for certain decor symbols, insignias. They were present,"" Bonta said. The district attorney noted that the 50-pound seizure of fentanyl in one afternoon exceeded the total amount seized at the U.S.-Canada border in an entire year by seven pounds. ""This one seizure could have killed literally every resident in L.A. County by itself,"" Hochman said. Priscilla Gomez -- who is currently in federal custody -- is charged with three counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance and one count sale to sell controlled substance. Her brother is charged with two counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance, while Mariscal is charged with two counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance and one count each of possession of a silencer and unlawful possession of ammunition prohibited by a prior conviction, Hochman said.

https://www.riotimesonline.com/von-der-leyen-pushes-eu-defense-spending-above-3-as-time-of-illusions-ends/,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urged member states Tuesday to increase defense spending beyond 3% of GDP during a European Parliament debate in Strasbourg. “Today we spend just short of 2% of our GDP on defense. Every analysis agrees that we need to move north of 3%,” declared von der Leyen. She reminded lawmakers how Europe reduced defense spending from an average of 3.5% to less than half after the Cold War. The Commission President emphasized the EU budget alone cannot solve the challenge. “The EU budget only reaches 1% of GDP. The bulk of new investments must come from member states,” she stated. Her ambitious “ReArm Europe” plan aims to mobilize €800 billion over four years for defense. Member states would contribute approximately €650 billion through increased national spending. The Commission proposes €150 billion in loans specifically for defense investments. The plan activates the “national escape clause” of the Stability and Growth Pact. This allows countries to exceed the 3% deficit threshold without penalties when spending on defense. Member states could raise defense expenditure by 1.5% of GDP on average. Von der Leyen Pushes EU Defense Spending Above 3% as “Time of Illusions” Ends. (Photo Internet reproduction) Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine drives this dramatic shift in security policy. “Putin has proven time and again he is a hostile neighbor. He cannot be trusted, he can only be deterred,” von der Leyen remarked. Europe Ramps Up Defense Spending Current defense spending varies dramatically across Europe. Poland dedicates 4.12% of GDP to defense while Spain spends just 1.12%. Von der Leyen warned Russia’s military production now outpaces Europe’s. Other European leaders support the initiative. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen emphasized, “The most important thing now is to rearm Europe, and we don’t have much time.” Poland’s Donald Tusk called the €150 billion proposal “a massive step, but not enough.” He believes raising national defense spending to 3% will become “inevitable.” The Commission recommends investing in air and missile defense, artillery systems, ammunition, drones, and cyber capabilities. Von der Leyen stressed contracts should prioritize European producers to strengthen the domestic defense industry. Germany plans to suspend its national debt limit to invest heavily in defense.

https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-seeks-postponement-as-trumps-25-steel-tariffs-take-effect/,"The Brazilian government has formally requested the United States to delay implementing the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports. The tariff took effect on March 12, 2025. Brazilian Vice President Geraldo Alckmin made this request during a video conference with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week. Brazil exported 4.3 million metric tons of steel to the US last year, representing nearly 48% of its total steel exports. The South American nation argues that its steel shipments do not harm US industry but serve as essential raw materials for American manufacturers. Lutnick reportedly told Alckmin he would relay the postponement request to President Trump. The Brazilian government seeks at least a one-month delay to continue negotiations and avoid damage to its export sector. President Trump’s proclamations, issued on February 10, ended all country exemptions and raised aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%. The tariffs also expanded to include downstream products like nuts, bolts, containers, and household items. The European Union swiftly announced retaliatory measures. It imposed tariffs on approximately $28 billion worth of American goods. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated these countermeasures would be implemented in two phases, completing by April 13. Trump initially threatened to impose 50% tariffs on Canadian steel but backed down after Ontario suspended electricity surcharges to three US states. This concession led to scheduled discussions between Canadian officials and US Commerce Secretary Lutnick. The reinstated tariffs terminate previous arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. All steel and aluminum imports now face the same 25% duty. Economic analysts warn these tariffs will increase production costs for US manufacturers of automobiles, home appliances, solar panels, and construction materials. This price increase could potentially slow the American economy and trigger inflation. Brazilian officials continue technical bilateral meetings with US counterparts this week. Washington has not yet officially responded to Brazil’s postponement request, leaving Brazilian exporters in uncertainty. Copyright Â© 2025 The Rio Times All Right Reserved Forgot your password?

https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-lawmakers-object-to-eus-multibillion-defense-proposal/a-71897342,"The Netherlands' parliament on Tuesday narrowly voted against a multibillion-euro European Union defense plan presented by Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof last week. The motion was introduced by the right-wing populist JA21 party, also known as the Conservative Liberals. It was supported by three of the four coalition parties. The motion passed in a 73-71 vote, with the opposition Socialists (SP) also voting in favor. Though the motion is not legally binding, it raises uncertainty about how the government will proceed. What is the ReArm Europe plan? The EU's ReArm Europe plan, presented by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, seeks to mobilize nearly €800 billion($872 billion) to strengthen European defense. The funding structure includes a €150 billion loan scheme secured against unused EU budget funds, as well as relaxed fiscal rules that could unlock €650 billion in additional spending.  EU leaders met in Brussels last week to significantly increase defense investments after Donald Trump halted US military support for Ukraine. Von der Leyen stressed that the plan is essential for Europe's security, stating, ""ReArm Europe could mobilize close to €800 billion for a safe and resilient Europe. We will continue working closely with our partners in NATO. This is a moment for Europe.” However, critics in the Netherlands argue that financing the plan would increase national debt, further dividing the government on the issue. NATO and its economic considerations NATO Secretary General and former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has publicly backed the plan, with members of his party warning that it would be ""irresponsible” for the Netherlands to withdraw support.

According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), the country's GDP grew by 0.4% in Q4 2024, outperforming the EU's overall growth rate of 0.1% for the same period.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrjg1d7z1o,"Ireland is ready to work with the United States to bring ""just, lasting and sustainable peace"" to Ukraine and the Middle East, the taoiseach (Irish PM) has said. The comments come as MicheÃ¡l Martin presented US President Donald Trump with a bowl of shamrocks in the White House as part of St Patrick's Day celebrations. It follows a bilateral meeting between the two leaders where the president raised a ""massive"" trade imbalance with Ireland and accused the European Union of treating the US ""very badly"". Earlier on Wednesday, the EUannounced it will impose counter tariffs on â
26bn ($28bn) worth of US goods from next month. At the shamrock presentation ceremony on Wednesday evening, Martin referenced the US intervention during in the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and its role in the creation of the Good Friday Agreement. ""The story of peace in Ireland is one that we wrote together,"" the taoiseach said. ""We know that building peace is a difficult and painstaking task but when the mighty United States of America puts its shoulder to the wheel, there is no mountain it cannot move."" Martin also praised Trump's ""unrelenting focus and energy"" in bringing peace to Ukraine and the Middle East. ""In my view, there is nothing more noble than the pursuit of peace and this is what you are doing,"" he added. In remarks beforehand, President Trump said he ""loves the Irish"". ""We're always going to have that special friendship,"" he said. ""The bond between our nations is as old as our country itself."" Earlier, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump addressed the ""massive deficit"" with Ireland. ""We want to sort of even that out as nicely as we can, and we'll work together."" Martin told President Trump that foreign investment is a two-way street, adding that Ireland is ""investing a lot more in America now"". The EU's move is in retaliation toPresident Trump's 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports into the US, which came into effect overnight. Trump said it had caused ""ill will"". ""The European Union's been very tough, and it's our turn too. We get a turn at that also,"" he said. ""I'm not knocking it, they are doing what they are doing for the EU, but it does create ill will and you know we are going to do reciprocal tariffs,"" he added. Official figures from Ireland's statistics agency suggest the country had a goods-trade surplus with the US of just over â
50bn (Â
41.6bn) in 2024. Ireland's goods exports to the US were â
72.6bn (Â
60.4bn) in 2024 while its imports from the US were â
22.5bn (Â
18.7bn). Trump said that the EU was ""set up in order to take advantage of the United States"". When asked if Ireland was also taking advantage of the US, Trump said: ""Of course."" ""I have great respect for Ireland, for what they did and they should have done just what they did. But the United States shouldn't have let that happen. We had stupid leaders, we had leaders who didn't have a clue."" He added: ""All of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies, this beautiful island of five million people has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasps. ""The Irish are smart, smart people and you took our pharmaceutical companies - and other companies - but you know, through taxation, proper taxation, they made it very, very good for companies to move up there,"" he added. Trump also said that if he drained Ireland of all the US companies ""maybe I'd lose the Irish vote"". ""We don't want to do anything to hurt Ireland, but we do want fairness and [Martin] understands that,"" he added. However, Martin said the pharmaceutical companies ""are doing very well in Ireland"", and that there was room to discuss a deal. ""I think there's room for those companies to grow in America and many of them, by the way, have already announced fairly significant manufacturing investments now [in the US],"" the taoiseach added. Martin said Ireland had served the US companies well with a strong, educated workforce and access to the EU single market. The president said Ireland's housing crisis was caused by the country ""doing so well"". Housing availability and cost is a major political and social issue in Ireland, with reportsstating thousands of new homes every yearare needed to keep up with demand. ""You know why they have a housing crisis? Because they're doing so well, they can't produce houses fast enough,"" Trump said. Martin added it was a ""good answer"". However the remark has drawn criticism from opposition parties, with Sinn FÃ©in stating that joking about the housing crisis is ""never a good answer"". Trump also praised Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy and MMA fighter Conor McGregor during the visit. He called McIlroy ""talented"", adding he had played a round with him three weeks ago. The president also complimented McGregor's tattoos: ""He's got the best tattoos I've ever seen"". After the bilateral meeting, both Trump and Martin travelled to Capitol Hill to attend the Friends of Ireland luncheon hosted by the US House speaker, Mike Johnson. Addressing the luncheon, Martin said Trump is a ""great friend of Ireland"" and ""we hope to welcome you back to our small island... very soon"". The United States has been a ""place of welcome and opportunity for Irish people"" for centuries, the taoiseach added. ""Our nation's green has been threaded through the rich tapestry of the United States by almost 32 million Irish-Americans."" Also speaking at the event, Trump said the ""Irish spirit is truly alive and thriving in America"". Prior to the meeting, Martin attended a breakfast hosted by Vice-President JD Vance. Speaking at the breakfast he said that the US ""has been a steadfast friend of Ireland for centuries"". He said the peace process was a ""signature achievement of US foreign policy"", adding that Ireland is ""ready to play our part in supporting work to end conflict and to secure peace in the Ukraine or in the Middle East or wherever"". Martin welcomed the ""progress that has clearly been made"" as a result of the Trump administration's ""unrelenting focus and effort"" to secure peace. Vance described the US-Ireland relationship as ""one of the great alliances and great friendships between nations"". He added that Ireland is a country with ""incredible communityâ
beautiful landscape and also a lot of interesting technological growth"". ""One of the more robust areas for us to work on with our Irish friends in the years to come is going to be technology and particularly artificial intelligence,"" he said. The taoiseach was the first EU leader to return to the Oval Office sincethe president's bust-up with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The bilateral meeting came amid heightened concern over the future of Ireland's economy, which is heavily reliant on US multinationals. Trump sees this as a trade imbalance and is keen to entice those companies back to the US. However, Martin said he would use his visit to the Oval Office to highlight an ""increasingly two-way"" trade and investment relationship. Speaking ahead of Martin's visit to the Oval Office, Democrat member of the House of Representatives Brendan Boyle told BBC News NI's The View that ""what the Trump administration is doing with respect to tariffs makes no economic sense, and it makes no sense in terms of our national security"". Boyle said that imposing tariffs on Canada suggests that no country is ""safe fully from this sort of madness"", including Ireland.

https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202503120011,"Taipei, March 12 (CNA) Premier Cho Jung-tai (å	8d	93æ¦®æ³°) told lawmakers on Wednesday that Taiwan's government ""does not have the capacity"" to spend 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) annually on national defense. ""It is impossible [for the government] to allocate more than NT$2 trillion (US$60.73 billion) for defense spending, given the current central government's budget scale,"" Cho said at the Legislature. Taiwan's central government budgets for both 2024 and 2025 are nearly NT$3 trillion, with social welfare spending the largest expenditures. The premier was responding to questions from Kuomintang legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi (å	82	85å´	90è	90	81) about how the government would react if the United States urged Taiwan to increase its defense budget to 10 percent of GDP. Fu said 10 percent would be NT$2.68 trillion, based on a government 2025 GDP estimate of NT$26.88 trillion. U.S. President Donald Trump had previously touched upon the issue during his presidential campaign, calling on Taiwan to raise its defense spending to as much as 10 percent. The calls were renewed earlier this month by Trump's pick for undersecretary of defense for policy Elbridge Colby in a Senate hearing. Trump ""has made the same demand [for defense budget increases] not only of Taiwan but also of many other countries,"" Cho said. ""Currently, the Republic of China (Taiwan's official name) does not have the capability to allocate a defense budget of NT$2.6 trillion,"" he said, adding that the budget would be determined based on the country's financial capacity and military needs. Taiwan's Cabinet had earmarked NT$647 billion for defense spending in 2025, equal to 2.45 percent of GDP, some of which was later cut or frozen by the opposition-controlled Legislature. President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸	85å¾·) later pledged to propose a special budget to raise defense spending to over 3 percent of GDP, though that, too, would require legislative approval. On Wednesday, Cho denied claims made by former legislator Kuo Cheng-liang (é	83	adæ	ad£äº®) in a recent political talk show that Washington had urged Taipei to extend compulsory military service from the current one year to two. There were no such discussions in the government or requests from the U.S., Cho said, stressing that ""the status quo remains unchanged.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gdjd57lro,"Somali security forces have ended a deadly 24-hour siege by Islamist fighters who stormed a popular hotel in the central city of Beledweyne, authorities said. The attack by al-Shabab began with a car bomb exploding, followed by gunmen entering the hotel, leading to intense clashes with security forces. ""The attackers have been neutralised. Some detonated themselves while others were killed by police forces,"" Omar Osman Calasow, the mayor of Beledweyne district, told the BBC. The mayor said seven people had been killed in the attack but witnesses said the death toll could be higher. The raid at the Qahira Hotel took place as politicians, security officials and traditional elders were meeting to discuss plans for an offensive against al-Shabab in central Somalia. Police officer Ali Mahad told AFP news agency that most of those in attendance had been rescued. A federal lawmaker from Beledweyne, Dahir Amin Jesow, told the BBC that about seven gunmen had attacked the hotel. It is unclear how many people have been wounded, but the lawmaker said they were trying to organise planes to fly victims to Mogadishu for treatment. Parts of the hotel were reduced to rubble as government forces and gunmen exchanged fire, shopkeeper Ali Suleiman, who witnessed the attack, told the Reuters news agency. ""We first heard a huge blast followed by gunfire, then another blast was heard,"" he said. Calasow said the 24-hour siege ended on Wednesday morning, leaving ""significant damage"". ""Among those killed in the attack were military officers, traditional elders, and soldiers,"" Calasow added. Al-Shabab said it had killed 20 people, including government officials and leaders of a pro-government clan militia. The federal government said it was still investigating and has not commented on the reported killing of the officials. In a statement, Ali Abdullahi Hussein, the president of Hirshabelle state, praised the security forces for their bravery in neutralising the extremist militants. ""Let us unite to complete the elimination of these brutal extremists,"" Hussein added. Beledweyne is about 335km (208 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, and is a strategic location in the campaign against al-Shabab. The Somali forces, alongside African Union peacekeepers, continue to wage a campaign against the militants, which remain a big threat despite the ongoing military operations.

https://apnews.com/article/trump-eu-tariffs-countermeasures-806a3b9bcc9cd4e45817e672d95f0070,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Major trade partners swiftly hit back at President Donald Trump’s increased tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, imposing stiff new taxes on U.S products from textiles and water heaters to beef and bourbon. Canada, the largest supplier of steel and aluminum to the U.S., said Wednesday it will place 25% reciprocal tariffs on steel products and also raise taxes on a host of items: tools, computers and servers, display monitors, sports equipment, and cast-iron products.

(AP Photo Meissner, File) Across the Atlantic, the European Union will raise tariffs on American beef, poultry, bourbon and motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans. Combined, the new tariffs will cost companies billions of dollars, and further escalate the uncertainty in two of the world’s major trade partnerships. Companies will either take the losses and earn fewer profits, or, more likely, pass costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices. Prices will go up, in Europe and the United States, and jobs are at stake, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers,” von der Leyen said. President Donald Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising that the taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown. The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. EU officials have made clear that the tariffs — taxes on imports — are aimed at products made in Republican-held states, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska and wood products from Alabama and Georgia. The tariffs will also hit blue states such as Illinois, the No. 1 U.S. producer of soybeans, which are also on the list. Spirits producers have becomecollateral damagein the dispute over steel and aluminum. The EU move “is deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild U.S. spirits exports in EU countries,” said Chris Swonger, head of the Distilled Spirits Council. The EU is a major destination for U.S. whiskey, with exports surging 60% in the past three years after an earlier set of tariffs was suspended. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the world’s biggest trading bloc, the EU, was expecting U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Von der Leyen said in a statement that the EU “will always remain open to negotiation.” Canada’s incomingPrime Minister Mark Carneysaid Wednesday he’s ready to meet with Trump if he shows “respect for Canadian sovereignty″ and is willing to take ”a common approach, a much more comprehensive approach for trade.″ Carney, who will be sworn in Friday, said workers in both countries will be better off when “the greatest economic and security partnership in the world is renewed, relaunched. That is possible.” “We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,” she said. The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures “will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.” “The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,” the chamber said Wednesday.

(AP Photo Cherry) Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. TheEU also imposed countermeasuresin retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items. This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First on April 1, the commission will reimpose taxes that were in effect from 2018 and 2020, but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.

(AP Photo Curtis) He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip “that the EU is not the problem.” “I argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,” Å efÄoviÄ told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Canada is imposing, as of 12:01 a.m. Thursday 25% reciprocal tariffs on steel products worth $12.6 billion Canadian (US$8.7 billion) and aluminum products worth $3 billion Canadian (US$2 billion) as well as additional imported U.S. goods worth $14.2 billion Canadian ($9.9 billion) for a total of $29.8 billion (US$20.6 billion.) The list of additional products affected by counter-tariffs includes tools, computers and servers, display monitors, water heaters, sport equipment, and cast-iron products. These tariffs are in addition to Canada’s 25% counter tariffs on $30 billion Canadian (US$20.8 billion) of imports from the U.S. that were put in place on March 4 in response to other Trump tariffs that he’s delayed by a month. The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports. The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services. ___ McHugh reported from Frankfurt and Gillies from Toronto.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-to-hold-talks-with-lebanon-on-border-dispute-releases-detainees-as-gesture/,"Israel and Lebanon agreed on Tuesday to open negotiations to delineate the border between the two countries, the Prime Ministerâ	 Office said. After a four-way meeting with the US and France at the United Nations peacekeeping force headquarters in Naqoura, the two sides also announced that three joint working groups would be established. The teams will focus on the five points Israel still occupies inside of Lebanon, the Blue Line that marks the de facto border between Israel and Lebanon, the points that are under dispute, and Lebanese citizens held by Israel. Israel also agreed to release five Lebanese detainees as a â	gesture to the new Lebanese president,â	 Joseph Aoun, the PMO said, adding that the release is coordinated with the US. Lebanon said it had received the four Lebanese â	 according to a statement by the Lebanese presidentâ	 office on X. Citing two US officials, Axiosreportedthat one of the Lebanese nationals released by Israel is a member of Hezbollah. According to reports in Lebanon, a total of 11 Lebanese nationals are currently being held by Israel. The working groups could meet as early as next month, according to Axios. Jerusalem and Beirutnegotiateda maritime boundary in 2022 â	 an agreement brokered by the US â	 but the two countries have yet to adopt an official land border. A November 27, 2024, truce in Lebanon largely halted more than a year of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, including two months of full-blown war during which Israel sent in ground troops. The fighting began with attacks by the terror group on the Jewish state on October 8, 2023, in support of ally Hamas, which had invaded Israel from Gaza a day earlier. Persistent rocket fire from Lebanon displaced some 60,000 Israeli civilians. â	 US Deputy Presidential Special Envoy Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. â	We look forward to quickly convening these diplomat-led working groups to resolve outstanding issues, along with our international partners.â	 Despite the diplomatic breakthrough, combat continued in Lebanon on Tuesday, with an Israeli drone strike in the southern part of the country killing a Hezbollah operative, a military source said. The strike on a car in the Nabatieh area in southern Lebanon on Tuesday targeted a Hezbollah commander in the terror groupâ	 aerial defense unit, said the IDF. He was identified by the military as Hassan Abbas Izzedine. Lebanese media outlets published images of the vehicleâ	 remains between the villages of Deir Zahrani and Humin al-Fawqa in Southern Lebanon. The IDF said he was a â	 in Hezbollahâ	 aerial defense unit and led attempts to rebuild the unitâ	 infrastructure that was decimated during the war. Izzedine also worked to procure new equipment for the unit, which posed a threat to Israeli military aircraft, the IDF added. Another Israeli Air Force strike in southern Lebanon targeted a group of Hezbollah operatives who were identified at a facility belonging to the Iran-backed group, according to the IDF. The IDF also carried out airstrikes on Friday night in southern Lebanon, saying it targeted a Hezbollah operative and sites used to store weapons and rocket launchers, adding that the strikes were carried out due to the threat they posed to Israel. Separately on Tuesday, the IDF carried out an airstrike on suspects in Gaza that were threatening Israeli forces, it said in a statement. The territoryâ	 Hamas-affiliated civil emergency service said the strike killed four people. According to the IDF, the drone strike targeted a group of Gazans near the Netzarim checkpoint, south of Gaza City. The military said the strike was ordered â	 The suspects were planting a bomb, a military source said. IDF troops are still deployed inside a buffer zone along the Gaza border amid an uncertain ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that officially ended at the beginning of the month. The IDF has repeatedly warned Palestinians against approaching the area. Over the weekend, the IDFcarried outairstrikes in Gaza, targeting operatives planting a bomb and another group operating a drone. In recent weeks, there have been several attempts to smuggle contraband into the Gaza Strip, with the IDF saying suspects on the Israeli side load up drones with weapons or drugs and fly them over the border. The strikes in Lebanon and Gaza came during ceasefires on both primary war fronts, but Israel has said it will continue to act against terror operatives who are in breach of the truces and who pose a threat to its forces. Last month, Israel withdrew all its forces from southern Lebanon, except five strategic points, saying it had received a green light from the US to remain at those posts and citing the need to prevent Hezbollah from returning to the area and threatening Israel. In Gaza, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that began on January 19, which has seen 33 Israelis returned. They are now in talks to extend it, though Jerusalem has warned it could soon resume fighting if Hamas does not continue to release hostages. Agencies contributed to this report.

https://apnews.com/article/greenland-trump-arctic-election-7d7fb1f07e1df2f28924e010073318e5,"NUUK, Greenland (AP) — The polling station in Greenland’s capital closed Tuesday in a parliamentary election that will determine the leaders who will confront U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to take control of the strategically placed Arctic country. Huge crowds streamed into the polling station in the capital, Nuuk, throughout the day, warmed by sunny skies. Exhausted voting officials closed the polls well after the planned 8 p.m. local time (2200 GMT) to make sure everyone in line got a chance to cast their ballot. Unofficial election results should be available in the coming hours, but they won’t be certified for weeks as paper ballots make their way to the capital from remote settlements by boat, plane and helicopter. Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede in February called elections a bit early, saying the country needed to be united during a “serious time” that is unlike anything Greenland has ever experienced. Greenland, a self-governing region of Denmark, straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and has rich deposits of the rare earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology. Trump has been outspoken about his desire to control Greenland, telling a joint session of Congress last week that he thought the U.S. was going to get it “one way or the other.” While the island of 56,000 people has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009, a break from Denmark isn’t on the ballot — even though it’s on everyone’s mind. Voters will instead elect 31 lawmakers who will shape the island’s future at a defining moment in history: Should Greenland declare independence? The mood was festive Tuesday at the sole polling station in Greenland’s capital city, Nuuk, as election workers opened the doors to cheers at 1100 GMT. Opinion polls show most Greenlanders favor independence. Most say they don’t dislike Americans, pointing to the good relations they have with the local Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, where U.S. military personnel have been stationed since 1951. But Greenlanders show no sign of wanting to become Americans. Even some of Trump’s biggest fans cling to the principle that they should control their destiny: their mantra is that Greenland is open for business, but not for sale. “The situation has changed because of Trump and because of the world,” said Doris Jensen, representative of the social democratic Siumut party who said she has always favored independence. “So we have decided in our party that we have to do (it) more quickly.” Trump’s attention has transformed the deeply local process of democracy. Suddenly, the presence of journalists from as far away as Japan and Croatia are reminders that these are far from normal times. Voter Sofia Rossen had a message for Trump: “Stop talking about Greenland. Stop,” she said in the polling station in Nuuk. The island and the U.S. previously had a positive relationship, but that doesn’t mean they want to be part of the United States, she told The Associated Press. Greenland’s future must be decided by its people, she said. “It is us, we are living here and we know what to do,” she said. “We are not for sale. We are not American, we won’t be Americans. We are not (Danes), but we are part of the Danish community.” “I think most of us have been scared since the new year because of (Trump’s) interest,” Pipaluk Lynge, a member of parliament from the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit, or United Inuit party, told The Associated Press. “So we’re really, really looking to Europe right now to see if we could establish a stronger bond with them to secure our sovereign nation.” After one of the final televised debates at a school auditorium in Nuuk, Prime Minister Egede was greeted by about 75 supporters who were almost outnumbered by photographers and cameramen. “All these reporters are frightening to us,’’ said Aviaja Sinkbaek, who works at the school. “It means that something must be happening soon.” She added: “I wonder what Trump has up his sleeve.” Politics in Greenland have a different rhythm. Debates during campaigning rarely got heated. People who became too animated were asked to step outside. Issues included building a skilled workforce and how to decorate the new airport, which in November opened a runway long enough to handle jumbo jets. On Tuesday, political parties pitched tents outside the polling station at the Nuuk sports hall, offering hot drinks and Greenlandic cake — a raisin-laced bread served with butter — in hopes of swaying voters. Certifying results will take weeks as ballot papers make their way to Nuuk. That’s because there are no roads connecting communities across the island’s 2.16 million square kilometers (836,330 square miles). Now the vast size has drawn outsize attention. Greenlanders know what they have. They hope the rare earth minerals will help diversify an economy where government jobs account for 40% of employment.

Any vessel that violates the group's ""ban on the passage of all Israeli ships"" will be targeted. This will continue ""until the crossings to the Gaza Strip are reopened and aid, food, and medicine are allowed in,"" the Houthi terror group's military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said on behalf of the Houthi leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi. This announcement follows al-Houthi's Friday statement that the terror group would resume its naval operations against Israel if Israel did not lift a blockage of aid into Gaza within four days. The Houthis, who control most of Yemen, also said in February that they would take military action if the US and Israel tried to displace Palestinians from Gaza forcibly. Iran's state news agency, IRNA, noted on Friday that al-Houthi warned ""that Yemen cannot tolerate the escalation of tension, the prevention of aid entry into Gaza, or the return of famine to this region of Palestine. The Zionist enemy has significantly reduced its obligations, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the number of patients moving outside of Gaza has decreased drastically.â															 Iran-aligned movement staged more than 100 attacks on shipping from November 2023, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians following Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza. These maritime attacks lessened following the January ceasefire in Gaza. The US State Department said on March 4 that it was designating the Houthi movement as a ""foreign terrorist organization"" after US President Donald Trump's call for the move earlier this year.

https://apnews.com/article/portugal-government-collapse-confidence-vote-2e081d0d60954cb1449636e420e0e687,"LISBON, Portugal (AP) — Portugal’s minority government lost a confidence vote in parliament Tuesday, forcing its resignation and bringing the European Union country’s third general election in three years. The government’s fall marks the worst spell of political instability since Portugal adopted a democratic system more than 50 years ago in the wake of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, which ended a four-decade dictatorship. A string of minority governments has been unable to forge alliances that might ensure the administration completes its constitutional four-year term without opposition parties teaming up to bring it down. A new election, likely in May, pitches the country of 10.6 million people into months of political uncertainty just as it is in the process of investing more than 22 billion euros ($24 billion) in EU development funds. The European continent, meanwhile, is facing immediate challenges to its security and economy. Voter discontent with a return to the polls could play into the hands of the radical-right populist party Chega (Enough), which has fed off frustration with mainstream parties. Portugal has been caught up in the rising European tide of populism, with Chega surging into third place in last year’s election. The government asked for the confidence vote, saying it was needed to “dispel uncertainty” about its own future amid a simmering political crisis that has focused on Social Democrat Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and distracted attention from government policy. After more than three hours of at times loud debate and following dramatic late twists as the government tabled proposals to avoid its defeat, the government called an hourlong recess and lawmakers went into a huddle. The government said it made a last-minute offer to the Socialists. Silence fell on the chamber after the result was announced. “Things are how they are. We gave our all,” Montenegro, the prime minister, told reporters as he left the National Assembly, Portugal’s parliament. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos, the leader of the largest opposition party, described the government’s conduct as “shameful,” saying it resorted to “maneuvers, games, tricks” to survive. The controversy has revolved around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Montenegro’s family law firm. Montenegro, who says he’ll stand for reelection, has denied any wrongdoing. He said he placed control of the firm in the hands of his wife and children when he became Social Democratic leader in 2022 and has not been involved in its running. It recently emerged that the firm is receiving monthly payments from a company that has a major gambling concession granted by the government, among other sources of revenue. The exact vote count wasn’t immediately available, but the speaker of parliament Jose Pedro Aguiar-Branco said the center-right government was defeated. The government, a two-party alliance led by the Social Democratic Party in power for less than a year, had just 80 seats in the current 230-seat legislature. An overwhelming majority of opposition lawmakers had vowed to vote against it. The center-left Socialists and Chega, which together hold 128 seats, voted against the government. Opposition parties have demanded more detailed explanations from Montenegro, and the Socialist Party wants a parliamentary inquiry that would dog the government for months. The Social Democrats are hoping that economic growth estimated at 1.9% last year, compared with the EU’s 0.8% average, and a jobless rate of 6.4%, roughly the EU average, will keep their support firm. The next general election in Portugal was scheduled for January 2028.","Portugal’s government loses confidence vote, triggering early election amid prolonged instability",Barry Hatton,AP News,2025-03-11T09:11:45,2025-03-11T16:58:48,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/congo-goma-m23-mpox-disease-outbreak-97ce140be2d7069aa0428a25011bba99,"MITI MURHESA, Congo (AP) — Hospitals across eastern Congo that were once at the forefront of the country’s response to the mpox outbreak are facing a setback in detecting the disease and offering treatment following the advance of Rwanda-backed rebels in the region. The mpox global health emergency is worsening as the fighting between the M23 rebel group and Congolese troops escalates in eastern Congo, which has been the epicenter of the health crisis. Many patients have fled and can’t be found. Recently arrived vaccines are running short as supplies can’t reach combat zones. Hospitals have been under attack. The Associated Press visited one of the mpox hot spots, which is now under control of M23 rebels backed by neighboring Rwanda. Health workers and remaining patients described a growing disaster. “The situation has been very difficult. Insecurity has disrupted everything,” said Dr. Serge Munyahu Cikuru, medical officer in charge of the Miti Murhesa health zone in South Kivu province’s Kabare territory. The country, meanwhile, continues to battle other diseases in the east, including cholera and measles, in addition to mysterious outbreaks that recently started in the northwestern region. Cases are not being reported as before Congo saw a 31% weekly increase in mpox cases last week, bringing the total to 16,255, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, that is only one side of the story: Only seven out of the 26 provinces reported cases last week, the public health agency said at its last briefing, partly blaming the security crisis. Although Congo has seen a surge in the current vaccination phase as compared to the previous one, much of that success is in other regions while eastern Congo remains cut off. The Miti Murhesa treatment center is fast running out of supplies. Mubake Buroko Patrick, an mpox patient at the facility, said it was difficult to get drugs in the weeks following the fighting. “The war has complicated our access to medicines,” he said. “I’m feeling a little better, but the treatment needs to be improved.” Africa CDC’s mpox incident manager Dr. Ngashi Ngongo told reporters last week that authorities have started negotiations for a humanitarian corridor, which would require the suspension of hostilities to allow for humanitarian access in conflict zones. Patients are fleeing in fear More than 600 mpox patients fled different hospitals in eastern Congo as the fighting escalated, the Africa CDC said. Many of the fleeing patients were in the Miti Murhesa health zone, one of the hardest hit in the mpox outbreak. At least 4,700 cases were reported there as of the end of 2024, according to the zone’s chief medical officer Dr. Cikuru. Only two of the four treatment centers in the zone are currently functional while others are among numerous health facilities affected by the fighting between government forces and M23, he said. As M23 seized Goma and Bukavu, their fighters were expanding their presence in the region, including in other parts of North Kivu and South Kivu provinces where they had been present for years. Many patients in Miti Murhe have had to “choose between staying under fire or fleeing” the rebels, Dr. Cikuru said. Tracing patients to prevent spread of mpox has become more difficult and health workers are running out of options on how to make the best of remaining medical supplies, he said. “Our fear is an increase in the number of cases due to the current situation,” the doctor said. “Patient care in the treatment centers continues, but the shortage of medicines is a major concern.” —— Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria.

https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-begs-ukraine-to-spare-russian-oil-pipelines-after-drone-strike-cuts-off-flow/,"Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary were interrupted on Tuesday after Ukraine launched a major wave of drone strikes against Moscow, just months after Budapest secured a sweetheart deal with Kyiv that allows it to keep buying supplies of fuel despite the invasion. In a video statement posted online, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said that ""oil deliveries on the Druzhba oil pipeline to Hungary had to be temporarily suspended"" following the drone attack. ""I have just spoken to Russia's deputy energy minister, who said that a drone hit at a measuring station has made deliveries impossible for the time being, but that repair work is underway and, unless something extraordinary happens, oil deliveries to Hungary could resume in the late afternoon or early evening."" Szijjártó called on Ukraine ""not to attack the energy infrastructure directed to Hungary"" as Kyiv works to weaken Russia's war machine. Kyiv's armed forces said Tuesday that they had ""struck a number of strategic objects of the Russian Federation involved in ensuring armed aggression against Ukraine."" Budapest has used what was supposed to be a temporary exemption to an European Union ban on Russian oil to step up its purchases of crude via the overland pipeline network, making major profits from discounted crude. In September, Ukraine signed off on an agreement that would allow Hungary to continue buying Russian oil despite having itself imposed sanctions on one of its major suppliers. Under the arrangement, the fuel is considered to be Hungarian the moment it crosses the border into Ukrainian territory, allowing it to transit the country. Hungary has repeatedly threatened to veto any efforts by the EU to further reduce its dependency on Russian energy. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán
last week blocked what would have otherwise been unanimous approval for a statement by European leaders affirming support for Ukraine and tougher sanctions on Moscow. In a
message posted online
on Tuesday, Ukraine's sanctions envoy, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, accused Hungary of using the ""Druzhba pipeline problem as an argument to block the continuation of sanctions"" at an EU level, arguing Budapest is undermining ""the unity of the EU.""",Hungary begs Ukraine to spare Russian oil pipelines after drone strike cuts off flow,"Gabriel Gavin, Csongor Körömi",POLITICO,2025-03-11T10:57:21,2025-03-11T11:26:46,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/north-sea-oil-tanker-fire-still-raging-us-probes-causes/,"LONDON — A 59-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter after a cargo ship collided with an oil tanker carrying jet fuel for the U.S. military off the coast of eastern England. United States, Portuguese and British authorities are currently probing the North Sea crash that set both vessels alight and triggered a major rescue operation. There is ""no evidence"" of foul play, the British government said Tuesday, as it confirmed its ""working assumption"" is that one of the sailors involved had died. The U.S. Stena Immaculate chemical tanker was carrying around 35 million liters of aviation fuel for the U.S. Navy’s	Military Sealift Command. The fuel has a high boiling point, meaning it evaporates slowly and is relatively toxic. It collided with the Portuguese Solong vessel, which, according to its German owners Ernst Russ AG, included containers that had previously held the toxic material sodium cyanide. The company stressed in a statement Tuesday that those containers were empty at the point of impact and ""will continue to be monitored."" CBS News cited an unnamed American sailor on board the Stena Immaculate who said “a massive ship came from out of the blue"" and collided with the tanker. In a fresh development Tuesday afternoon, Humberside Police announced that a 59-year-old man had been taken into custody. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Nicholson said: ""Extensive work has already been carried out and we are working closely with our partners to understand what happened, and to provide support to all of those affected. ""Following inquiries undertaken by my team, we have arrested a 59-year-old man on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision, this follows the conclusion of search operations by HM Coastguard for the missing crew member of the Solong."" The man remains in custody, the force said, and police will ""continue speaking with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident."" One crew member from the Solong is still missing, and now believed dead, with a search called off Monday night. Its other 13 members are accounted for, with all 23 crew members on the Stena Immaculate also accounted for. Updating the House of Commons Tuesday, Maritime Minister Mike Kane said: ""Our working assumption is that, very sadly, the sailor is deceased. The coast guard has informed the company, and it has been advised to inform the next of kin."" But he stressed: ""Whether there was foul play, I think, is speculation. There is no evidence to suggest that."" A spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday that the Marine and Coast Guard Agency — which leads counter-pollution work in British waters — had ""a range of equipment"" at its disposal to ""contain and disperse"" spills. They added: ""I understand that there doesn't appear to be any suggestions of foul play at this time."" As the flag states for the ships involved, U.S. and Portuguese authorities are leading the investigation into the collision. Fellow government minister Matthew Pennycook said Tuesday that they were being assisted by U.K. authorities to assess the potential environmental impact. He vowed the three countries would “get to the bottom of why this incident happened."" The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed Monday night it was sending investigators to the U.K. to assist the probe. A Coast Guard spokesperson said it was ""actively engaged with the United Kingdom’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch and Portugal’s Marine Safety Investigation Authority to coordinate joint evidence-collection efforts” at the scene of the crash. ""Investigators from the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are deploying to the United Kingdom to conduct the investigation over the coming days,” they added. “Our team is actively engaged with all local authorities, and we will work with clean-up teams to ensure every effort is made to mitigate further impacts on the marine environment,"" said a spokesperson for Ernst Russ AG.

Rescue teams and security forces arrived at the scene, launching an operation to track down the assailants. Railway officials confirmed that an emergency relief train had been dispatched for assistance.

""During this operation, BLA fighters have released women, children, and Baloch passengers, ensuring that all remaining hostages are serving personnel of the occupying forces,"" it added. For decades, separatist militant groups in Balochistan have waged an insurgency, frequently targeting the government, army, and Chinese interests while demanding a greater share of the region\'s mineral wealth.

https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250311-european-nato-paris-ukraine,"French President Emmanuel Macron
on Tuesday called on military chiefs from across Europe and beyond to draw up a plan ""to define credible security guarantees"" for Ukraine
in the event of a ceasefire, the presidency said. His appeal, in a closed-door Paris meeting of top brass from more than 30 allied states, came as Ukraine endorsed an American proposal for a month-long ceasefire and agreed to immediate negotiations with Russia, in pivotal talks in Jeddah. Macron has sought to rally a European response to Washington's shock policy shift in US-Russia relations. The Paris meeting gathered representatives from 34 countries
– most of them from Europe and NATO, but also from Australia, New Zealand and Japan. There was no representative from the United States, which is the leading member of NATO. ""This is the moment when Europe must throw its full weight behind Ukraine, and itself,"" Macron told the meeting, according to the Élysée. France pushes shift to ‘wartime economy’ as US turns its back on Ukraine ""In view of the acceleration of peace negotiations,"" it was necessary to start planning to ""define credible security guarantees"" to make a lasting peace in Ukraine a reality, the French presidency reported Macron saying. Macron has teamed up with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to lead efforts to form a ""coalition of the willing"" to enforce an eventual ceasefire in Ukraine. According to the Élysée, the military chiefs of staff from European and NATO
nations
– including Britain and Turkey
– agreed that the security guarantees ""should not be separated from NATO and its capabilities"". Such guarantees should be ""credible and long-term, and should be accompanied by unfailing support for the Ukrainian army"", according to the Élysée. More than three years since Russia invaded its neighbour, Europe is scrambling to boost its defences and break free from dependence on the United States. It has been unsettled by Trump renewing contacts with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and criticising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, raising fears that the US president may try to force Ukraine to accept a settlement favouring Russia. Trump has also suspended military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. Ahead of the meeting, French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said: ""We will reject any form of demilitarisation of Ukraine."" ""It is simply a question of looking ahead and thinking about what the Ukrainian army should be in the future,"" Lecornu added. Full address: Macron calls for major European rearmament Rearmament of Europe On Friday, the French president, who has pushed his country's defence industry to switch to ""war economy mode"", is set to meet with defence manufacturers, according to a member of his team. After Tuesday's talks, defence ministers from Europe's five main military powers
– France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Poland
– are to meet in the French capital on Wednesday. EU and NATO representatives and the Ukrainian defence minister will also take part. Those talks will centre on the ""necessary rearmament of Europe"" and military support to Ukraine, one of Lecornu's aides has said. Starmer will, in turn, host virtual talks on Saturday with leaders of the nations willing to help support the ceasefire. Macron has said any European troops in Ukraine would be deployed only ""once a peace deal is signed, to guarantee it is fully respected"". He has also said he would be ready to discuss extending France's nuclear deterrent to European partners.

https://apnews.com/article/canada-ontario-us-trump-tariffs-electricity-834dc3d9defd314923912f9bd8540e31,"TORONTO (AP) — Ontario’s premier, the leader of Canada’s most populous province, announced that effective Monday it is charging 25% more for electricity to 1.5 million American homes and businesses in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war. Ontario provides electricity to Minnesota, New York and Michigan. “I will not hesitate to increase this charge. If the United States escalates, I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference in Toronto. “Believe me when I say I do not want to do this. I feel terrible for the American people who didn’t start this trade war. It’s one person who is responsible, it’s President Trump.” Ford said Ontario’s tariff would remain in place despite the one-month reprieve from Trump, noting a one-month pause means nothing but more uncertainty. Quebec is also considering taking similar measures with electricity exports to the U.S. Minnesota receives only a small share of its electricity from Ontario, but Democratic Gov. Tim Walz was sharply critical of Trump’s actions that led to Monday’s announcement from Ford. “The first victims of Trump’s Trade war? Minnesotans struggling to pay their skyrocketing electric bill,” Walz said on X with a link to a story about Ontario’s move. “Minnesotans cannot afford Trump’s billionaire-run economy. We have to put a stop to this madness.” In a brief press availability later Monday, Walz acknowledged that Minnesota doesn’t get a lot of electricity from Ontario, but he’s worried about Manitoba following suit. “So look, even if it were one megawatt, this is totally unnecessary. And the fact of the matter is, it doesn’t impact Donald Trump one bit. It impacts ratepayers in Minnesota. For what? These are our friends,” he said. Walz said he’s even more worried about the impact on Minnesota if Canadian potash fertilizer gets caught up in the trade war. “If it starts with this, the one that I’m really worried about is potash, when it comes behind it. If they do potash, that’s a big one on agriculture,” he said. Walz said he discussed these concerns last week when he spoke with the premiers of Ontario and Manitoba. He said they told him the dispute is broader than just their trading relations with Minnesota. “They were very clear that it’s not Minnesota -- we’re huge trading partners.” Minnesota Power, the main electrical utility serving the part of Minnesota that borders Ontario, gets only a “very small” proportion of its power from the province, company spokesperson Amy Rutledge said. Minnesota Power bought only about $300,000 worth of electricity from Ontario last year, and only for four months out of the year. The utility serves over 150,000 customers, mostly with power it generates itself in Minnesota, she said. While it gets about 11% of its power supply from Manitoba Hydro, she said, that’s not affected by Ontario’s announcement. At a news conference, Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he’s putting a 25 percent tax hike on electricity exports. “We really expect any impact on our customers to be negligible,” Rutledge said. Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the organization that manages a regional power grid that stretches from Manitoba to Minnesota to Louisiana, also expects little effect, spokesman Brandon Morris said. MISO gets under half its power from Canada, and less than half of that comes from Ontario, he said. Matt Helms, public information of officer for the Michigan Public Service Commission, said the impact on Michigan customers is likely to be “small” and most of Michigan’s electricity is produced by utility companies in the state or through long-term contracts. Of greater concern to the commission is the reliability of the electric grid, as electricity flows between the U.S. and Canada as part of an interconnected grid. “Any action to limit or disrupt these flows would remove a layer of protection and make all of us — Canadians and Americans alike — more vulnerable to grid-scale outages,” Helms said. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she has ordered state energy officials to conduct a review on how much the tariffs could drive up electricity and other energy costs in the state. “These federal tariffs have been poorly conceived from the start: crafted in secret with no transparency and no clear economic rationale, they’ve only served to destabilize our capital markets and create uncertainty among New York families and businesses,” said Hochul, a Democrat. The new surcharge is in addition to the federal government’s initial $30 billion Canadian dollars ($21 billion) worth of retaliatory tariffs applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products. Trump launched a new trade war last week by imposing tariffs against Washington’s three biggest trading partners, drawing immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China and sending financial markets into a tailspin. “It needs to end. Until these tariffs are off the table, until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario will not relent,” Ford said. ___ Associated Press writer Steve Karnowski in St. Paul, Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan and Anthony Izaguirre in Albany, New York contributed.

Cho made the remarks during a parliamentary session amid signs that the DOE, which oversees energy and nuclear policies, is reviewing the possibility of placing South Korea on its sensitive country list. If placed, researchers from countries on the list undergo more stringent scrutiny when joining research facilities or projects affiliated with the department, potentially making it harder for them to participate in U.S. research on advanced technologies, such as atomic energy, artificial intelligence or quantum technology. Cho said his ministry received an ""unofficial tipoff"" about the DOE's review of South Korea and is working to ""grasp the situation"" based on this information. The DOE does not appear to have finalized South Korea's designation yet, the foreign minister also noted. Based on the unofficial information it has, South Korea has raised an issue with the DOE, which is now looking into the matter again, according to Cho. ""As far as I know, once the United States grasps the situation internally, it may come to us and discuss it,"" he said. Asked whether growing public calls for South Korea's nuclear armament may have influenced Washington's review, Cho acknowledged that such speculation exists. ""It is understandable that such a view is circulating as one possible explanation,"" he said. ""However, we need to see whether it is the only factor. Since the internal circumstances remain unclear, we cannot rule out the possibility that this is a one-time occurrence caused by a less significant factor than we assumed."" Once more information becomes available, the government will conduct a thorough review of the situation and take necessary measures, he added.

https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-845564,"Iranhas launched a large-scale joint naval exercise with Russia and China in the northern Indian Ocean, days after its supreme leader dismissed an offer from the US president for nuclear negotiations. The Combined Maritime Security Belt drill aims to improve maritime security and enhance coordination between the three nations while also involving observers from several other countries. Iranian Navy Deputy Operations Commander Admiral Mustafa Tajaldini described the primary goal of the exercise as strengthening naval cooperation and securing major maritime routes. â	The primary goal of this exercise is to enhance maritime security in the northern Indian Ocean and strengthen naval cooperation between the Iranian, Chinese, and Russian navies,â	Tajaldini said, as quoted by theTehran Times. He further noted the broader regional significance, pointing to critical trade routes such as the Straits of Malacca, Hormuz, and Bab el Mandeb. â	Our goal is to strengthen collective security, and weâ	ve invited Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) nations and regional countries to contribute to this effort,â	 he added. Chinaâ	’s Defense Ministry stated that the exercise includes drills on striking maritime targets, damage control, and joint search-and-rescue operations. Russiaâ	’s TASS news agency reported that the exercise features 15 combat ships, support vessels, and helicopters. Iranian media reported that observers from Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates were present in Chabahar, Iranâ	’s key port on the Gulf of Oman, for the drills. Security analysts see the exercise as a clear signal of growing military ties between Iran, Russia, and China as they seek to counterbalance US influence in the region. The Gulf of Oman, where the drills are taking place, serves as a crucial maritime passage linking the Indian Ocean to the Strait of Hormuz, through which over a quarter of the worldâ	’s seaborne oil trade passes. When asked about the naval exercises,US president Donald Trumpdismissed concerns, telling Fox News aboard Air Force One: â	Weâ	’re stronger than all of them. We have more power than all of them.â	 The exercise comes at a time of heightened tensions following Iranâ	’s rejection of nuclear talks with Washington, signaling a continued standoff in diplomatic efforts. Meanwhile, the US 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, maintains a strong presence in the region, keeping a close watch on maritime security developments.","Iran holds joint naval drill with Russia, China after rejecting US talks on nuclear program",THE MEDIA LINE STAFF,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-11T04:45:00,2025-03-11T04:49:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d4z4lnxvxo,"South Sudan's government has denied earlier reports that Uganda had deployed special forces to its capital, Juba. Uganda's military chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba said the soldiers had gone to the neighbouring country to help South Sudanese President Salva Kiir ""secure"" the city. The statement came amid escalating tensions between Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, raising fears that their fragile peace deal could collapse and a conflict could resume.  ""We shall protect the entire territory of South Sudan like it was our own,"" Gen Kainerugaba had written on the social media platform X.  Uganda's army spokesperson Felix Kulayigye also confirmed the deployment to the BBC but declined to reveal details. South Sudan's government did not immediately respond to the reports on Tuesday morning, but speaking to local media later Information Minister Michael Makuei said Ugandan troops were not in Juba. Concern about the security situation in South Sudan has been mounting, with the US on Saturday ordering the evacuation of all its non-emergency staff from the country.  Last week, the deputy chief of the army and two ministers - all allies of Machar - were arrested by the security forces, which an opposition spokesman called a ""grave violation"" of the peace deal. One of the ministers has since been released. The arrests followed clashes in the Upper Nile state between government forces and a militia known as the White Army. It had fought alongside Machar during the civil war that broke out in 2013 following  a power struggle between him and Kiir. It led to heavy fighting in Juba, with Kiir accusing Machar of plotting a coup. Machar denied the allegation, but South Sudan then plunged into a civil war that killed more than 400,000 people. A 2018 power-sharing agreement between the two stopped the fighting, but key elements of the deal have not been implemented - including a new constitution, an election and the reunification of armed groups into a single army.

https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-reports-largest-drone-attack-on-10-regions-as-ukraine-to-meet-united-states-peace-talks/,"KYIV — Ukraine launched its biggest drone attack on Moscow since the start of the war with Russia on Monday night, hours before a delegation from Kyiv was due to meet with United States representatives for peace talks in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine's armed forces ""struck a number of strategic objects of the Russian Federation involved in ensuring armed aggression against Ukraine,"" they said in astatementTuesday. TheRussian military saidit shot down 337 Ukrainian drones over 10 Russian regions. Three people were killed and 18 injured, and several residential buildings damaged, according to Russian officials. “The most massive drone attack on Moscow has been repelled tonight. Some 74 drones were shot down near Moscow, and hundreds at different frontiers,” the city's Mayor Sergei Sobyaninsaid in a statement. Russia has launched a criminal investigation into “terrorism.” Ukraine's armed forces said the attack targeted strategic facilities involved in Russia's aggression, and said that Russian air defenses were to blame for damage to ""a number of civilian infrastructure facilities."" Officials in Kyiv said the attack was a signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “All the drone strikes in Russia tonight — on Moscow, on airports and so on — are the signal to Putin that he also must be interested in a truce in the sky that Ukraine is going to offer today during talks. Not only oil refineries,"" Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Ukrainian government’s center for countering disinformation,\u00a0said in a video statement. ""Drones can also massively attack Moscow. Of course, air defense shoots down those drones. But this does not save Russians from panic.” In Jeddah on Tuesday, a Ukrainian delegation headed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov are meeting representatives from U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The talks are now underway, with Yermak writing on Telegram that they began ""very constructively,"" and they are ""working to bring about a just and lasting peace."" Asked whether Ukraine’s overnight attack was perceived as an attempt to compromise peace negotiations, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said “there is nothing to disrupt yet” as negotiations with Ukraine haven't yet started. “For now, the Americans, in their own words, are trying to understand how ready Ukraine is for peace negotiations. There are no negotiations yet, so there is nothing to disrupt here,"" said Peskov. The Trump administration, however, had a different reading of the talks' progress on Monday. The White House included bringing ""Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table through historic peace talks in Saudi Arabia in pursuit of peace,"" in alist of Trump's achievementssince taking office. The Ukrainians say they are hoping for “constructive dialogue” and a resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing, while the Americans want to determine whether Kyiv is serious about peace with Russia and\u00a0what concessions it is prepared to offer\u00a0to achieve it. “Among other things, we will offer truce in the sky and at sea. But Russians also have to agree to it. Because it is about mutual actions, but from our side it is a serious proposal,” a Ukrainian official told POLITICO, granted anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations. “We hope for constructive dialogue. And, in general, the composition of the Ukrainian delegation demonstrates that Ukraine is serious about this meeting and its goal. It is a truly high-level delegation.” Meanwhile on Tuesday, NATO leaders from 30 countries are gathering in Paris — without the U.S. — to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine and shore up support for Kyiv should Washington further withdraw.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/asia/iran-china-russia-joint-navy-drills-intl-hnk/index.html,"Warships from Iran, China and Russia kicked off their annual joint exercises in the Gulf of Oman on Monday, showing off their military ties as US President Donald Trump upends longstanding Western alliances. The “Security Belt-2025” drills, taking place near the Iranian port of Chabahar, is the fifth joint naval exercise Iran, China and Russia have held since 2019, according to Chinese state media. Analysts have long seen the drills as a demonstration of the growing partnership among the three authoritarian powers as they seek to counterbalance US influence and challenge the Western-led global order. But this year, the optics are even more pronounced as Trump disrupts the transatlantic alliance – a cornerstone of Western security for decades – by embracing Russia at the expense of Ukraine, and pushes Asian allies to pay more for US protection. Asked about the drills on Sunday, Trump said he is “not at all” concerned about the show of force by the three US adversaries. “We’re stronger than all of them. We have more power than all of them,” he told Fox News aboard Air Force One. Concerns have been mounting in Washington about the emerging strategic partnership among China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, which US lawmakers have described as an “axis of authoritarianism,” “axis of autocrats” and “axis of dictators.” The fear is that a shared animosity toward the US is increasingly driving these countries to work together – amplifying the threat that any one of them alone poses to Washington or its allies, not just in one region but perhaps in multiple parts of the world at the same time. At the same time, Trump has openly embraced Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a bid to end the war in Ukraine by talking directly to Moscow while leaving Kyiv and European allies on the sidelines. Russia and North Korea’s military relationship has strengthened considerably over the last year, with the two signing a mutual defense agreement and Pyongyang sending its troops to fight for Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine. The drills also come amid heightened tension between US and Iran. Related articleChina’s warships are turning up in unexpected places and alarming US allies. Is this the new normal? Since returning to the White House, Trump has restored what he calls his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in an attempt to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon – a move denounced by Tehran as “bullying” tactics. The Gulf of Oman is a crucial gateway connecting the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Hormuz, through which more than one-quarter of the world’s seaborne traded oil passes. The US maintains its own significant presence in the region via the Fifth Fleet which is based out of nearby Bahrain. Russia’s Defense Ministry said the joint naval exercises will involve 15 combat ships, support vessels and gunboats, as well as helicopters, according to state news agency TASS. “The Russian side is represented by the Rezky and Russian Hero Aldar Tsydenzhapov corvettes, and the Pechenega tanker of the Pacific Fleet,” the ministry is quoted as saying. China, meanwhile, deployed the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Baotou and supply ship Gaoyouhu from a nearby naval escort task force to take part in the exercise, the Chinese Defense Ministry said in a statement. The drills, with an aim to “enhance military trust and strengthen practical cooperation,” will include simulated strikes on maritime targets, visit-board-search-seizure operations and search and rescue drills, the ministry added. Iran has sent a stealth missile corvette and a patrol ship, according to Iranian state media.","Iran, China and Russia launch annual joint naval drills as Trump upends Western alliances",Nectar Gan,CNN,2025-03-10T06:50:01,2025-03-10T06:50:01,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/north-sea-ship-collision-coastguard-d9c97c9968d04907fb9d9e94145e9072,"LONDON (AP) — A cargo ship hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military off eastern England on Monday, setting both vessels ablaze and sending fuel pouring into the North Sea. All but one of the 37 crew of the two ships were brought safely ashore. One crew member from the cargo ship, Solong, was missing, the vessel’s owner Ernst Russ said in a statement. The ship owner said “13 of the 14 Solong crew members have been brought safely (to) shore.” The owner of the fuel tanker said all 23 of its crew members were safe. The two ships were still ablaze 12 hours after the collision, British coast guards said. They said they had ended the search for the missing crew member. They confirmed 36 others had been brought ashore, one of whom was hospitalized. The collision triggered a major rescue operation by lifeboats, coast guard aircraft and commercial vessels in the foggy North Sea. The British government said it was assessing “any counter-pollution response which may be required over the coming days.” The Marine Accident Investigation Branch was investigating the cause of the collision. The U.S.-flagged chemical and oil products tanker MV Stena Immaculate was at anchor near the port of Grimsby on Monday morning after sailing from Greece, according to ship-tracking site VesselFinder. The Portugal-flagged container ship Solong was sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands when it struck the tanker’s side. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports an oil tanker, and a cargo ship have collided off the coast of eastern England, setting both vessels on fire and triggering a major rescue operation. U.S.-based maritime management firm Crowley, which operates the Stena Immaculate, said the tanker “sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel,” when the container ship struck it, triggering a fire and “multiple explosions onboard,” with fuel released into the sea. The Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government’s Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed. The Solong’s cargo included sodium cyanide, which can produce harmful gas when combined with water, according to industry publication Lloyd’s List Intelligence. It was unclear if there had been a leak. Britain’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the alarm was raised at 9:48 a.m. (0948 GMT). Humber Coast Guard asked vessels with firefighting equipment and those who could help with search and rescue to head to the scene about 155 miles (250 kilometers) north of London. Video footage aired by British broadcasters and apparently filmed from a nearby vessel showed thick black smoke pouring from both ships. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said details of the collision and its cause “are still becoming clear.” Abdul Khalique, head of the Maritime Center at Liverpool John Moores University, said it appeared the crew of the cargo ship had not been “maintaining a proper lookout by radar” as required by international maritime regulations. Greenpeace U.K. said it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage from the collision, which took place near busy fishing grounds and major seabird colonies. Scientists said the environmental impact might be less severe than with a spill of heavier crude oil. “Whilst the images look worrying, from the perspective of the impact to the aquatic environment, it’s less of a concern than if this had been crude oil because most of the jet fuel will evaporate very quickly,” said Mark Hartl of the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Biotechnology at Scotland’s Heriot-Watt University. Mark Sephton, professor of organic geochemistry at Imperial College London, said jet fuel disintegrates more quickly than crude oil, and warmer temperatures speed biodegradation. “In the end, it all depends on the rate of introduction of fuel and the rate of destruction by bacteria,” he said. “Let’s hope the latter wins out.” ___ Associated Press journalist Krutika Pathi in London contributed.","A cargo ship hits a tanker and they catch fire off England, with one crew member missing",Jill Lawless,AP News,2025-03-10T12:15:42,2025-03-10T18:18:16,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-war-news-ba90f0de3d4f64a1762d1a39f787817f,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, officials said Sunday, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory. Hamas called it part of Israel’s “starvation policy.” Israel last week suspended supplies of goods to the territory of more than 2 million Palestinians, an echo of the siege it imposed in the earliest days of the war. Israel is pressing the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. That phase ended last weekend. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others. The militant group — which has warned that discontinuing supplies would affect the hostages — said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position. Israel has said it would send a delegation to Qatar on Monday in an effort to “advance” the negotiations. Israel had warned when it stopped all supplies that water and electricity could be next. The letter from Israel’s energy minister to the Israel Electric Corporation tells it to stop selling power to Gaza. The territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated, and most facilities, including hospitals, now use generators. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassam said that Israel has ”practically” cut off electricity since the war began and called the latest decision part of Israel’s “starvation policy, in clear disregard for all international laws and norms.” The desalination plant was providing 18,000 cubic meters of water per day for central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah area, according to Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement. Executive director Tania Hary said that it’s expected to run on generators and produce around 2,500 cubic meters per day, about the amount in an Olympic swimming pool. Israel’s restrictions on fuel entering Gaza have a larger impact, Hary said, and water shortages are a looming issue, because fuel is needed for distribution trucks. Israel has faced sharp criticism over suspending supplies. “Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,” the U.N. human rights office said Friday. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used “starvation as a method of warfare” when it issued an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. The allegation is central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. Israel has denied the accusations, saying it has allowed in enough aid and blaming shortages on what it called the United Nations’ inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid. The leader of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid doesn’t resume to Gaza. The Houthis described their earlier attacks as solidarity with Palestinians there. The ceasefire has paused the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies. US envoy describes talks with Hamas The White House on Wednesday made the surprise confirmation of direct U.S. talks with Hamas. On Sunday, envoy Adam Boehler told Israeli broadcaster Kan that Hamas has suggested a truce of five to 10 years while it would disarm. The militant group has previously called disarming unacceptable. A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss contacts with the U.S., said that the group had expressed its longstanding position that it would lay down its arms in return for a “fair and just solution” that includes an independent Palestinian state. Boehler also told CNN that “I think you could see something like a long-term truce, where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they’re not part of the political party going forward. I think that’s a reality. It’s real close.” When asked if he would speak with the militant group again, Boehler replied, “You never know.” He added: “I think something could come together within weeks,” and expressed hope for a deal that would see all hostages released, not only American ones. Boehler has said four of the five American hostages in Gaza are dead, with Edan Alexander alive. Hamas on Sunday didn’t mention the talks, but reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections. Hamas’ attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and took 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Many Israelis are pressing for a deal to bring everyone home. “We are here to send a clear message to the Israeli government: stop stalling,” Zahiro Shahar Mor, nephew of slain hostage Avraham Munder, said in front of tents set up outside Israel’s defense ministry in one demonstration. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t say how many of the dead were militants. With the cutoff of supplies to Gaza, Palestinians are reporting sharp price increases for dwindling items during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. “Since the ceasefire began, the situation has improved a little. But before that, the situation was very bad,” said Fares al-Qeisi in the southern city of Khan Younis. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Follow developments at  Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250310007500315,"SEOUL, March 10 (Yonhap) -- The National Assembly kicked off a bipartisan parliamentary organization aimed at strengthening the nation's alliance with the United States on Monday, as South Korea seeks to navigate through economic fallout and reaffirm the alliance under U.S. President Donald Trump. During the meeting, acting U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Joseph Yun and Jeon Jae-sung, professor of international relations at Seoul National University, discussed the significance of the alliance and inter-parliamentary cooperation. The body, comprised of 162 lawmakers from the ruling People Power Party (PPP) and opposition parties, will have one chairperson and one secretary appointed from each side. PPP Rep. Cho Kyung-tae and Rep. Chung Dong-young of the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) will serve as chairs and PPP Rep. Cho Jung-hun and DP Rep. Kim Young-bae as secretaries. ""It is highly meaningful that this is the first official body within the National Assembly dedicated to promoting exchanges with the U.S. Congress,"" chairperson Cho said. ""We will play a crucial role in further advancing the Korea-U.S. alliance."" Unveiling his vision for strengthening parliamentary diplomacy and a roadmap for advancing high-tech industries, Cho added that the union will seek to boost bipartisan cooperation and ""maximize the strategic value of the South Korea-U.S. alliance."" National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik also stressed the importance of bolstering parliamentary cooperation at the meeting, noting that countries and businesses worldwide are paying keen attention to the policies of the new U.S. administration. ""Many countries are putting in full efforts, playing 'good cop and bad cop,'"" Woo said. ""If necessary, our government and parliament should divide our roles too.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36wkg47z1po,"Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump. The former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. In much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. ""Americans should make no mistake,"" he said. ""In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win."" Carney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks. Carney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. The Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. Carney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland. Loud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital. The party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. Carney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month. The governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country At the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls. They have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party. Much of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's ""unjustified tariffs"" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. The US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement. Canada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy. Carney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was ""attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses"". ""We can't let him succeed,"" he added, as the crowd booed loudly. He said his government would keep tariffs on US imports ""until the Americans show us respect"". Canada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed. ""I know these are dark days,"" Carney said. ""Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. ""We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead."" Carney also pledged to ""secure our borders"" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south. The US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre. ""Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,"" said Carney. ""Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him."" Shortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader. He warned that Canada was facing an ""existential challenge"" from the US under Trump. The Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being ""just like Justin"". They accuse the Liberals of a ""sneaky"" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader. Poilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. Carney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December. Federal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he ""embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues"". ""I'm really, really excited for what's coming. And frankly, it's time for an election."" The Liberals will face Poilievre's Conservatives, who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons; the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats; and the New Democrats, who have 24, when Canadians next go to the polls. The former central banker has run on a broadly centrist agenda, a shift from Trudeau, who moved the Liberals to the left. A major promise is to push forward major energy projects like pipelines, which have faced political roadblocks in recent years. He has promised major investments in housing and clean energy projects, and to liberalise trade within Canada, where barriers remain between provinces, as well as diversifying the economy away from the US. During the leadership race, Carney promised to cap the size of the federal government, which expanded 40% under Trudeau.",Mark Carney: Canada's next PM vows to win trade war with Trump,Jessica Murphy,BBC News,2025-03-09T19:05:30,2025-03-09T23:13:48,gemini-2.0-flash

Communities in southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales (NSW) were beginning the clean-up on Sunday after the storm caused widespread flooding and knocked down power lines and trees. A 61-year-old man's body was recovered from floodwaters on Saturday, while in a separate incident, 12 soldiers were taken to hospital after their convoy crashed en route to rescue operations. The storm had weakened by the time it made landfall near Brisbane on Saturday night, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday warned locals of the continued wild weather and risks from flooding. ""The situation in Queensland and northern New South Wales remains very serious due to flash flooding and heavy winds,"" Albanese said. ""Heavy rainfall, damaging wind gusts and coastal surf impacts are expected to continue over coming days."" Cyclone Alfred had hovered for days off the country's east coast as a category two cyclone before weakening into a tropical depression on Saturday. By Sunday evening, emergency services had conducted over a dozen rescues in Queensland and NSW - most involving people trapped by rising waters in their cars or homes. The NSW State Emergency Service reported receiving more than 6,000 calls for help. Almost 290,000 properties in the affected regions remain without power, and energy companies have warned residents the blackouts could persist for days. Police said on Saturday they had discovered a body in the search for a 61-year-old man who went missing on Friday after his car was caught in floodwaters in Dorrigo, northern NSW. Emergency responders witnessed the man escaping his car and climbing onto a tree near the riverbank, but rescuers were not able to reach him before he was swept away. In a separate incident on Saturday, 12 soldiers were injured in a convoy crash in Lismore, about 200km south of Brisbane, as they were on their way to rescue and recovery efforts. The soldiers were still in hospital on Sunday, two of them in a serious condition, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told a news conference. ""We wish a speedy recovery for all of those young soldiers,"" he said. Queensland's police authorities said they had not recorded any fatalities or missing people in the state so far as a result of the weather event.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250309000453315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, March 9 (Yonhap) -- Tens of thousands of people were expected to gather in Seoul on Sunday to rally for or against impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol a day after his surprise release from detention. Sarang Jeil Church, led by conservative activist pastor Jeon Kwang-hoon, held a Sunday service outdoors near the presidential residence in central Seoul. Around 4,500 people had gathered as of noon, according to an unofficial police estimate. ""With President Yoon's release, the impeachment trial has become meaningless. It's over,"" Jeon said. ""In the event the Constitutional Court does something funny, we will exercise the people's right to resist and get rid of them with a single slash."" On Saturday, Yoon was released from the detention center where he had been held since mid-January over his failed martial law bid in December, after a court ruled that his detention was invalid. Even in the absence of physical detention, Yoon still has to stand trial on charges of leading an insurrection and is awaiting the verdict of the Constitutional Court on whether to uphold or dismiss his impeachment. Conservative civic group Angry Blue was scheduled to hold a separate rally, opposing Yoon's impeachment at Bosingak Pavilion at 1 p.m. before marching along Jongno 3-ga street. An opposing rally by a group of activists calling for Yoon's immediate ouster was held overnight just outside of Seoul's Gyeongbok Palace, and the group held a press conference outside the nearby government complex Sunday to declare a week of ""emergency action"" urging Yoon's removal from office. At 2 p.m., the group will begin a march from the National Palace Museum, with the reported attendance of 100,000 people, leading to partial road closures in the area. At 7 p.m., the group held another rally near Gyeongbokgung Station, with an estimated 5,000 people taking to the streets to criticize the prosecution for letting Yoon walk without appealing the court's ruling. Representatives from the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) attended the rally, and DP Chairman Lee Jae-myung drew loud cheers when his image appeared on the screen on the stage. The activists marched toward the Constitutional Court, a little over 1 kilometer east of the subway station. They plan to gather for a rally near the station at 7 p.m. every evening until the Constitutional Court hands down its verdict on Yoon. Jeon had also said his group would also hold a daily rally in front of the court starting Monday. Meanwhile, DP demanded Prosecutor General Shim Woo-jung resign immediately to take responsibility for the prosecution's release of Yoon following the court ruling. The party threatened to consider all possible measures, including his impeachment, should the top prosecutor refuse. ""The Democratic Party will immediately file a complaint against Prosecutor General Shim Woo-jung,"" floor leader Park Chan-dae said after an emergency general meeting of lawmakers. ""Prosecutor General Shim released Yoon Suk Yeol, the ringleader of an insurrection, after voluntarily giving up the opportunity to immediately appeal the court decision (to release him) and receive the judgment of a higher court."" Also on Sunday, the DP and four other minor opposition parties -- the Rebuilding Korea Party, the Jinbo Party, the Basic Income Party and the Social Democratic Party -- agreed at a meeting of their leaders to jointly call for Shim's resignation and push for his impeachment should he refuse.

https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/09/for-the-first-time-an-election-in-greenland-will-be-closely-watched,"Greenland is the world's largest island - it's larger even than France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, and Belgium combined. But despite its size, Greenland remains a self-governing territory of Denmark and its foreign, defence and monetary policies are all decided in Copenhagen. Since 80 percent of it is permanently covered in ice, much of it remains uninhabitable. It has a tiny population of just 56,000 people, most of them indigenous Inuits. They've long taken pride in a culture and traditions that's helped them survive for centuries in some of the most rugged conditions. They have a close link to nature and belong to one of the most beautiful, remote, untouched places on Earth. But Greenlanders now find their voices greatly amplified on the world stage after President Donald Trump's outlandish claimed that the US would take over their island. Most say they donâ	 want to be American, and many are both worried and overwhelmed by the comments and the attention Trump's comments have brought. But many also see the global spotlight on them as an opportunity to promote their longstanding push for independence from Denmark, which is a key issue in Tuesday's legislative elections. Since 1979, Greenland has had its own prime minister who is able to govern at a local level. He or she has to come from the party with the most seats, which is currently the left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit party. Currently the prime minister is MÃºte Egede, who coincidentally will celebrate his 38th birthday on the day of the election. The parliament - the Inatsisartut - has just 31 MPs who will be chosen from six political parties, two of whom are in the governing coalition of the Inuit Ataqatigiit and the Simiut parties. Since few opinion polls take place on the North Atlantic island, it is less clear than in other European elections as to what the outcome might be. But one poll conducted by Verian in January asked 497 Greenlanders who they would vote for. It suggested that the Inuit Ataqatigiit party could gain about 31% and beat the Siumut party by about 9%. The Simiut party has promised a vote on independence after the election, which may help it attract more voters, and perhaps allow it to choose the next prime minister. But Naleraq is the largest opposition party, and it's been growing in popularity with its pro-independence policy and its apparent willingness to collaborate with the United States. Qupanuk Olsen, who is Greenland's most popular influencer, is running for Naleraq, and with more than 500,000 followers on TikTok and 300,000 on Instagram, she has the best online platform to campaign from. Unsurprisingly, Greenlanders are not keen for the US to take them over. Just hours after Trump declared in his speech to a joint session of Congress that he intends to gain control of the island â	 one way or the other,"" Greenlandâ	 prime minister Egede posted a simple message on Facebook: â	 Greenland is ours.â	 â	 Kalaallit Nunaat is ours,â	 Egede said in the post, using the Greenlandic name for his country. â	 We donâ	 want to be Americans, nor Danes; We are Kalaallit. The Americans and their leader must understand that. We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,â	 he said. The post ended with a clenched fist emoji and a Greenlandic flag. Since taking office six weeks ago, Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in mineral-rich Greenland, which sits along strategic sea lanes in the North Atlantic off the northeastern coast of Canada, closer to Washington than to Copenhagen. Trump made a direct appeal to Greenlanders in his speech to US Congress, just a week before the countryâ	 voters cast their ballots in parliamentary elections. â	 We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America,â	 Trump said. â	 We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before,â	 he added. Greenlanders voted overwhelmingly in favour of self-government in a 2009 referendum that also established a pathway to independence whenever the people of the island support such a move. Under the terms of that referendum, Denmark remains responsible for Greenlandâ	 defence and foreign affairs, with the local government controlling other matters. Asked about Trumpâ	 comments, Denmarkâ	 Foreign Minister Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen said he doesnâ	 think Greenlanders want to separate from Denmark only to become â	 an integrated part of America.â	 Rasmussen said he believed Trumpâ	 reference to respecting Greenlandersâ	 right to self-determination was the most important part of his speech. â	 Iâ	 m very optimistic about what will be a Greenlandic decision about this,â	 he said during a trip to Finland. â	 They want to loosen their ties to Denmark. Weâ	 re working on that, to have a more equal relationship.â	 He added that it was important for next weekâ	 elections to be free and fair â	 without any kind of international intervention.â	 Greenland is vital to the world, though much of the world may not realise it. The U.S and other global powers covet its strategic location in the Arctic; its valuable rare earth minerals trapped under the ice needed for telecommunications; its billions of barrels of untapped oil. Thereâ	 s also potential for shipping and trade routes as the ice that covers most of Greenland keeps retreating because of climate change. If that ice melts, it would reshape coastlines across the globe and potentially shift weather patterns. Denmark colonised Greenland 300 years ago and still exercises control over foreign and defence policy, though Greenland won self-rule in 1979 and runs itself through its parliament. Trumpâ	 comments about Greenland also set off a political crisis in Denmark. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen went on a tour of European capitals to garner support, saying the continent faced â	 a more uncertain reality,â	 while her country moved to strengthen its military presence around Greenland. Greenlandâ	 economy depends on fisheries and other industries as well as on an annual grant of about 554 million euros from Denmark. Aka Hansen, an Inuk filmmaker and writer, is suspicious of Trumpâ	 intentions - but still thanks him for turning the worldâ	 attention to her homeland. Like many other Greenlanders, she wants her homeland and people to be respected and she doesnâ	 want to be ruled by another colonial power. But she feels Trumpâ	 rhetoric has increased the momentum for independence from Denmark. Denmark has been accused of committing abuses against Greenlandâ	 Inuit people, including removing children from their families in the 1950s with the excuse of integrating them into Danish society and fitting women with intrauterine contraceptive devices in the 1960s and 1970s â	 allegedly to limit population growth in Greenland.

https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-insists-us-still-an-ally-despite-ukraine-aid-cutoff/,"The United States remains an ally for Europe, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen insisted on Sunday, following Washington's decision to cut off aid to Ukraine. But the top EU official chose not to include the U.S. in a list of ""like-minded"" countries with which she said Europe could entertain deeper partnerships, instead name-checking Canada, Norway and Britain. In the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to halt all military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, the European Commission chief was pressed repeatedly by reporters on whether she considered America, as well as the Trump administration, to still be among the allies of European countries. ""My position is clear: The United States are an ally in the transatlantic alliance,"" von der Leyen told a press conference marking the first 100 days of her second term in office. The German politician also insisted that Europe's relationship with the U.S. was ""totally different"" from the one it has with China, brushing aside the need for ""de-risking"" with the United States. But von der Leyen, who is yet to meet Trump in person since he was sworn in on Jan. 20, did point to a number of problems in world affairs that can be linked to Trump's actions, without naming the U.S. president or his country. ""We see that sovereignty but also ironclad commitments are called into question,"" she said, adding that ""everything"" had become ""transactional."" She touted the EU's recent push to sign new trade deals with third countries, including the Mercosur bloc in South America, as signaling openness and praised Europe's ""predictability."" ""We have learned the very hard way that sourcing products we need from partners we trust is the best way to avoid over-dependencies or to avoid vulnerabilities and blackmail,"" she said. Indeed, the EU has been forced to wean itself mostly off Russian gas following years of dependency via the now-destroyed Nord Stream II pipeline. European countries that have bought billions of euros worth of American weaponry now face questions about how dependable those arms are given the U.S. decision to limit its weapons' capabilities in the midst of Ukraine's defensive war with Russia. Von der Leyen underscored the EU's new push to spend some €800 billion on its defense industry, saying that the share of military kit sourced from Europe would have to increase ""gradually."" Currently, the EU is heavily dependent on U.S.-made weapons. As von der Leyen was speaking in Brussels, Poland's foreign minister sent a tweet suggesting Warsaw could look for alternatives to Elon Musk's Starlink ""if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider."" Von der Leyen was asked if she planned to meet with Trump in the near future. ""I think we will have a personal meeting when the time is right and this is the state of play at the moment,"" she said.",Von der Leyen insists US still EU ‘ally’ despite Ukraine aid cutoff,Nicholas Vinocur,POLITICO,2025-03-09T11:11:24,2025-03-09T12:47:12,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-845315,"Defense Minister Israel Katz on Sunday confirmed reports that Israel intends to allow Syrian Druze and Circassians to work in the Israeli side of the Golan Heights. The unusual move of allowing foreign citizens of a hostile state, such as Syria, to work in Israel could have geopolitical ripples across the region and is a testament to how radically the Middle East has changed in just a few months. Assad regime was toppled by rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is led by Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, last December 7-8. Until then, the regime had abided by a 1974 ceasefire with Israel. Nevertheless, it was formally in a state of war with Israel, while it served as a critical link in the chain of smuggling Iranian weapons to Hezbollah. This also presented a direct threat to Israel from Iranian militias that might invade and from the Syrian military’s air force, long-range missiles, and chemical weapons. The Syrian Druze were a minority in the Assad era who mostly kept to themselves, with some past positive history with Israel, especially with the Israeli Druze community. But it still mostly considered Israel to be a hostile party. Sharaa changed all of that. His ascent to power sowed fear within Israel of a jihadist invasion and among Syrian Druze that they would be oppressed or attacked, even though he said he wants quiet within Syria and along its borders. Not trusting Sharaa due to his jihadist background, Israel moved quickly to create a buffer zone in southern Syria to prevent even the possibility of a new invasion; included in this zone were large segments of the Syrian Druze population. IDF in Syria Throughout the three months that IDF Division 210 has been in southern Syria, there have been efforts to build stronger relations with the Syrian Druze to keep them calm about Israel’s presence there and to avoid friction. Katz’s move, even though it is restricted to the Golan, is a major step in seeking to deepen relations between Israel and that community. It is also a sign that Israel plans to remain in southern Syria for an extended period. The timing of the announcement follows internal tensions within Syria that turned into deadly clashes with about 1,000 casualties. The top commander of a Syrian Kurdish armed group, whose forces are in a separate battle with Turkey, blamed Turkish-backed Islamist factions for some of the most disturbing violence, including the reported executions of civilians belonging to Assad’s Alawite sect. Sharaa’s office said it was forming an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings by both sides. The clashes have pitted Assad loyalists against the country’s new Islamist rulers. The violence has led much of the West to question whether the new Syrian regime can be trusted and integrated into the Western economic system. Technically, there is no clear basis in international law for Israel to remain in Syria indefinitely or for Israel’s argument that its presence in Syria benefits the local Syrians and justifies the legitimacy of the IDF’s continued presence there. Katz credited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich with facilitating the move. Israel would protect the Syrian Druze community from threats by the new regime, he said. Reuters contributed to this report.",Israel Katz confirms Syrian Druze to be allowed to work in Golan Heights,YONAH JEREMY BOB,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-09T11:57:57,2025-03-09T17:25:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pledges-to-resurrect-shipbuilding-as-china-seen-outpacing-us-/8004070.html,"When President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he had created a new White House office to ""resurrect"" American military and commercial shipbuilding, he elevated long-standing calls to fix the struggling industry that he said is vital to national security. His clarion call to build more ships ""very fast and very soon"" comes at a time of rising strategic competition with China. ""Our shipbuilding industry is shrunk down to bare minimum right now,"" Marine Corps Commandant General Eric Smith told VOA in an exclusive interview at the Pentagon late last year. The anemic state of American shipbuilding and ship maintenance, and the risks they raise for the military, was shared with VOA through more than a dozen interviews with U.S. military and industry officials spanning several months and conducted ahead of Trump's announcement. The U.S. Navy is still considered the most powerful in the world when it comes to firepower and tonnage, but the number of Navy ships has fallen behind China’s. The United States has 296 ships in its fleet, while China’s is on pace to surpass 400 ships this year. Shrinking fleet Despite the U.S. Navy’s goal of increasing the size of its fleet, in recent years the number of ships has been shrinking. Last year’s budget funded just six new Navy ships, while decommissioning 15 from the fleet, for a net loss of nine. The fiscal 2025 budget plan funds six new ships while decommissioning 19, for a net loss of 13. The lifeblood for maritime industry titans like British-based BAE, U.S.-based Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) and Fairbanks Morse Defense runs almost exclusively through the U.S. military. Industry leaders say they have the space to build and repair more ships but that Navy contracts have been scarce. ""We’re operating at about half-capacity,"" said Brad Moyer, vice president of BAE Systems Ship Repair. Although the company is one of the largest for ship repair in the United States, when VOA toured BAE’s Norfolk yard in Virginia in November, most of the docking spaces for ships were empty. Shipbuilding demand has fluctuated wildly based on Navy budgeting strategies, creating an industry atmosphere of feast or famine that is shrinking the supply chain. ""There's thousands and thousands of suppliers that have gone out of business, and it's a real risk,"" George Whittier, the CEO of Fairbanks Morse Defense, told VOA. The company is the largest engine manufacturer in North and South America and the sole U.S. company supplying the biggest engines used in the military’s amphibious warfare ships. Each engine is about the size of a small school bus. ""We should have two engine suppliers. But the reality is, if the Navy is only going to build six ships a year, it's a struggle to keep one engine supplier in business, let alone two. We're going to have to grow our way out of this, and that’s the only way we're going to do it,"" Whittier said. He is not alone. VOA found multiple examples of companies that were the only supplier of specific ship parts. The U.S. military and other industry leaders say they are worried there will not be a backup for parts should more industry businesses go under. And those suppliers who have survived say when business is not steady, it takes longer to provide the parts, and it costs more to procure the materials. Acting Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jim Kilby, while advocating for a bigger fleet, says he has not had the budget to replace all of his aging ships and submarines, much less grow the force. ""When we get a new ship, we'll replace an old ship, because that old ship is more expensive and harder to maintain,"" he said in a recent interview. Maintenance delays, layoffs Military contracting delays and project cancellations have led to layoffs. Even though BAE is one the largest companies in the industry, its West Coast shipyard laid off nearly 300 employees in 2023 due to a shortage of work. In the city of Norfolk, on America’s East Coast, the number of Navy ships available for repair work dropped from 44 ships about a decade ago to fewer than 30 today. About 60% of the workforce was furloughed in that time, officials said. The result, General Smith says, is a hollowed-out workforce that is not centered on shipbuilding. ""There's no one who grew up as a shipbuilder. There's welders and steam fitters and electricians, but if there's not steady work for them, they'll go to work for Harley-Davidson or Ford Motor Company or Chevy or whoever,"" he said. Whittier and Moyer blame the budgeting process in Congress, along with the way the Navy structures its ship maintenance. ""The system is broken,"" Whittier says. Congress has not passed a budget on time since 2019. When continuing resolutions (CRs) are used to fund the government, new projects cannot be started. In the case of the fiscal 2024 budget, Congress funded government with CRs for half a year, which Whittier says gave companies six months to do 12 months of work. ""It ends up being not just a big challenge in how to run a company, but it's a big challenge for the Navy in trying to figure out how are they getting their maintenance done. … It's frustrating all around for everybody,"" the Fairbanks Morse Defense CEO told VOA. Senator Mark Kelly, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, agrees that CRs are bad, adding that the only thing worse would be shutting down the government. ""People are always going to try to blame somebody else, but I’d just say collectively, we’ve taken our eye off the ball here,"" he added. Shipbuilding struggles There is also a shortage of skilled workers needed to keep the shipbuilding industry afloat. Huntington Ingalls Industries’ shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, along the coast of the Gulf of America is the only yard in the United States that builds the Navy’s two types of amphibious warfare ships: Landing Helicopter Assault ships (LHAs) that look like mini-aircraft carriers, and smaller landing platform docks (LPDs). HII also builds Navy destroyers and Coast Guard cutters. Kari Wilkinson, executive vice president at HII, says that keeping staffing levels around the more than 11,000 workers needed to build cutters, destroyers and amphibious ships is getting more difficult, particularly in the post-pandemic economy. Just a few years ago, the shipyard was able to offer wages much higher than other jobs in the area that do not require a college degree. Now, Wilkinson says they are competing with everyone from coffee providers to fast food restaurants. ""The wage circumstance has changed. There is not that big gap anymore,"" she told VOA. As a result, Wilkinson says, HII now loses workers at roughly double the rate of its pre-pandemic levels. To save money on materials, Congress authorized the military to buy four amphibs from HII at once, a move known as a multi-ship block buy. Buying them in bulk saved the Pentagon $900 million. ""That was a huge win for us,"" General Smith said. Now, HII must figure out how to better retain its workforce. To make the worksite more attractive, HII has invested in air conditioning and giant shades to shield workers from the elements like the hot Mississippi sun. The Pascagoula shipyard hired 7,000 people in the last two years, Wilkinson says, but it will need about 1,000-2,000 more hires each year to complete the new ship orders. ""We've got to find ways to pay people competitive wages that are in accordance with the type of work they're doing,"" Kelly told VOA. Commercial shipping Congress is expected to increase the military’s budget to surge resources for its shipbuilding shortfalls. But Kelly tells VOA that U.S. commercial shipping is also in need of saving. ""We went from 10,000 ships during World War II to 85 today. So, in case of an emergency, in case of a conflict with a near peer adversary, we're quite limited to getting all those supplies and equipment and troops across the ocean,"" he said. The United States builds about five commercial ships each year. China builds more than 1,000. ""They have one shipyard, just one shipyard, that's bigger than all of our shipyards put together,"" the senator told VOA. Kelly in December introduced bipartisan legislation called the Ships for America Act. The bill aims to increase the U.S. commercial fleet by 250 ships in 10 years, which will also increase the supply chain for military ships. ""You wouldn’t really think those two things are connected. But they are very closely connected,"" he said. ""A lot of the parts that go into a U.S. aircraft carrier, some of those same parts for those systems go in merchant ships.","China far outpacing US in military, commercial ship numbers",Carla Babb,Voice of America (VOA News),2025-03-09T07:35:15,2025-03-12T17:01:56,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/trump-deportations-migrants-panama-costa-rica-darien-rights-afghanistan-70f79684ac9e0701bc34e3e7144944c5,"PANAMA CITY (AP) — After weeks of lawsuits and human rights criticism, Panama on Saturday released dozens of migrants who were held for weeks in a remote camp after being deported from the United States, telling them they have 30 days to leave the Central American nation. It thrust many like Hayatullah Omagh, a 29-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2022 after the Taliban took control, into a legal limbo, scrambling to find a path forward. “We are refugees. We do not have money. We cannot pay for a hotel in Panama City, we do not have relatives,” Omagh told the Associated Press in an interview. “I can’t go back to Afghanistan under any circumstances ... It is under the control of the Taliban, and they want to kill me. How can I go back?” Authorities have said deportees will have the option of extending their stay by 60 days if they need it, but after that many like Omagh don’t know what they will do. Omagh climbed off a bus in Panama City alongside 65 migrants from China, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal and other nations after spending weeks detained in poor conditions by the Panamanian government, which has said it wants to work with the Trump administration “to send a signal of deterrence” to people hoping to migrate. Human rights groups and lawyers advocating for the migrants were waiting at the bus terminal, and scrambled to find the released migrants shelter and other resources. Dozens of other people remained in the camp. Among those getting off buses were migrants fleeing violence and repression in Pakistan and Iran, and 27-year-old Nikita Gaponov, who fled Russia due to repression for being part of the LGBTQ+ community and who said he was detained at the U.S. border, but not allowed to make an asylum claim. “Once I get off the bus, I’ll be sleeping on the ground tonight,” Gaponov said. Others turned their eyes north once again, saying that even though they had already been deported, they had no other option than to continue after crossing the world to reach the U.S. The deportees, largely from Asian countries, were part of a deal stuck between the Trump administration and Panama and Costa Rica as the U.S. government attempts to speed up deportations. The administration sent hundreds of people, many families with children, to the two Central American countries as a stopover while authorities organize a way to send them back to their countries of origin. Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process. The agreement fueled human rights concerns when hundreds of deportees detained in a hotel in Panama City held up notes to their windows pleading for help and saying they were scared to return to their own countries. Under international refugee law, people have the right to apply for asylum when they are fleeing conflict or persecution. Those that refused to return home were later sent to a remote camp near Panama’s border with Colombia, where they spent weeks in poor conditions, were stripped of their phones, unable to access legal council and were not told where they were going next. Lawyers and human rights defenders warned that Panama and Costa Rica were turning into “black holes” for deportees, and said their release was a way for Panamanian authorities to wash their hands of the deportees amid mounting human rights criticism. Upon being released Saturday night, human rights lawyers identified at least three people who required medical attention. One has been vomiting for over a week, another deportee had diabetes and hadn’t had access to insulin in the camp and another person had HIV and also didn’t have access to medicine in detention. Those who were released, like Omagh, said they could not return home. As an atheist and member of an ethnic minority group in Afghanistan known as the Hazara, he said returning home under the rule of the Taliban — which swept back into power after the Biden administration pulled out of the country — would mean he would be killed. He only went to the U.S. after trying for years to live in Pakistan, Iran and other countries but being denied visas. Omagh was deported after presenting himself to American authorities and asking to seek asylum in the U.S., which he was denied. “My hope was freedom. Just freedom,” he said. “They didn’t give me the chance. I asked many times to speak to an asylum officer and they told me ‘No, no, no, no, no.’” Still, he said that leaving the camp was a relief. Omagh and other migrants who spoke to the AP detailed scarce food, sweltering heat with little relief and aggressive Panamanian authorities. In one case, Omagh and others said, a Chinese man went on a week-long hunger strike. In another, a small riot broke out because guards refused to give a migrant their phone. The riot, they said, was suppressed by armed guards. Panamanian authorities denied accusations about camp conditions, but blocked journalists from accessing the camp and cancelled a planned press visit last week. While international aid organizations said they would organize travel to a third country for people who didn’t want to return home, Panamanian authorities said the people released had already refused help. Omagh said he was told in the camp he could be sent to a third country if it gives people from Afghanistan visas. He said that would be incredibly difficult because few nations open their doors to people with a Afghan passport. “None of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,” said Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama’s deputy foreign minister, in an interview with the AP last month. That was the case for some, like one Chinese woman who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions from Panamanian authorities. Upon getting off the bus, the first thing she wanted to do was find a Coca-Cola. Then, she’d find a way back to the U.S. “I still want to continue to go to the United States and fulfill my American dream,” she said. ___ Janetsky reported from Mexico City.",Panama releases dozens of detained deportees from US,"MEGAN JANETSKY, Alma Solís, MATÍAS DELACROIX",AP News,2025-03-09T04:53:39,2025-03-09T12:53:20,gemini-2.0-flash

https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2025/03/09/erdogan-ally-warns-of-pkk-affiliated-groups-must-disarm-as-well,"A key ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday that all “affiliated groups” of the Kurdish militant group PKK must disarm as well, as part of a historic ceasefire deal with Ankara. Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), had last month called on his group to disband and end more than four decades of armed struggle against Turkey. For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app. But Ankara also wants all PKK fighters disarmed wherever they are, notably those in the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the bulk of which is made up of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG). The SDF leadership welcomed Ocalan’s call on February 27 to disband, but said it did not apply to its forces. “The PKK terrorist organization and its affiliated groups must immediately and without preconditions lay down their weapons,” said Devlet Bahceli, head of the hardline nationalist MHP party. Bahceli is considered the key sponsor of the talks between Ankara and PKK, after he offered a surprise peace gesture if Ocalan rejected violence. “The fact that the YPG and other similar terrorist groups claim to be exempt from this call ... is completely contradictory to the leadership of the organization,” Bahceli said in a statement. The PKK announced a ceasefire after the call by Ocalan, who has been imprisoned for the past 26 years, saying that “none of our forces will carry out any armed operation unless they are attacked.” Since 2016, Turkey has carried out three major military operations in northern Syria, targeting PKK militants, which it sees as a strategic threat along its southern border. The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU, has waged an insurgency since 1984. Its original aim was to carve out a homeland for Kurds, who make up about 20 percent of Turkey’s 85 million people. Since Ocalan's incarceration in 1999, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed that has left more than 40,000 dead.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gx52xqqpo,"Three Bulgarian nationals have been found guilty of spying for Russia, in what police have described as ""one of the largest"" foreign intelligence operations in the UK. Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, who were all living in London, were part of a group who travelled Europe carrying out surveillance on journalists, a former politician and a US military base in Germany between 2020 and 2023. While the trio had day jobs as a beautician, a healthcare worker, and a decorator, the cell they were part of plotted to kidnap and kill targets, as well as planned to ensnare them in so-called honeytraps. The methods they used were the sort of thing you would ""expect to see in a spy novel"", said the Metropolitan Police's Cdr Dominic Murphy. How spy ring living double lives did Kremlin's dirty work Gaberova, of Euston, north London, Ivanova, of Harrow, north London, and Ivanchev, of Acton, west London, were convicted of conspiracy to spy, while Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents. They were working for fellow Bulgarian Orlin Roussev, 47, who ran the spy ring from a 33-room former guest house in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Here police found a ""treasure trove"" of spying gadgets and equipment, including cameras hidden in ties, a camera hidden in a fake rock, and glasses containing recording equipment. They also found a number of Minions cuddly toys, including one which contained a spy camera. Roussev had referred to those working for him as his ""minions"", like the yellow sidekicks of dastardly villain Gru in the Despicable Me children's film franchise. Roussev previously admitted conspiracy to spy, alongside Biser Dzhambazov, 43, of Harrow, while a sixth defendant, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, of Greenford, west London, admitted spying before the trial. The cell's key targets were investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov, whose work includes exposing Russia's role in the nerve agent attacks on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018. As part of the surveillance, Gaberova was instructed to befriend Mr Grozev, with Roussev describing him as ""hooked and in love"" with her in WhatsApp messages. Another operation included carrying out surveillance to identify Ukrainian soldiers at a military site where they were being trained, around the time of Russia's invasion of the country in 2022. During the trial, prosecutor Alison Morgan KC said the spy cell was ""sophisticated in their methodology; carrying out surveillance activity of individuals and places; manufacturing and using false identities and deploying advanced technology to acquire information"". The police investigation received 221 mobile phones, 495 sim cards, 11 drones, and devices allowing data to be extracted from phones and eavesdropping on wi-fi activity. Met counter-terrorism chief Cdr Murphy said the case was an ""extremely sophisticated"" operation that ""posed a threat to national security and individuals"". Roussev received instructions from Jan Marsalek, who is wanted in Germany for his alleged fraud linked to the financial services company Wirecard. The Austrian national was described by prosecutors as an ""intermediary for the Russian intelligence services"". Roussev and Marsalek met a decade ago, with Roussev subsequently recruited as a spy. He then recruited other Bulgarians to undertake espionage operations. Orlin Roussev was arrested by police in a guesthouse in Great Yarmouth. Roussev was at one stage the chief technology officer for a city of London financial firm. Stoyanov worked as a medical courier, but also fought in mixed martial arts fights using the nickname ""The Destroyer"". Dzhambazov and Ivanova lived together as a couple and worked in healthcare jobs, but also ran a Bulgarian community organisation that provided courses on ""British values"". But Dzhambazov was also in a relationship with Gaberova – they were found in bed together when police made arrests – and Ivanchev had separately been in a relationship with her in the past. During their trial, Ivanova and Gaberova admitted undertaking surveillance operations but denied knowing it was for the benefit of Russia. Ivanchev did not give evidence during the trial but outlined a similar position during police interviews after being arrested. He was arrested a year after the other five defendants and told police he had several conversations with MI5. The prosecution case focused on six operations carried out by the spies: Operation 1 This targeted the Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev. Marsalek and Roussev exchanged messages discussing their options in relation to Mr Grozev, including the placing of team members in seats next to him on planes. He was followed throughout Europe and properties connected to him were watched in Austria and Bulgaria. The spy cell also discussed potentially robbing him of his laptop and phone and taking it to the Russian Embassy, burning his property, kidnapping him and taking him to Moscow, or killing him. Operation 2 This targeted journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, a Russian national. The cell followed him in various countries, and discussed kidnapping him in the UK and smuggling him out of the country using a small boat. At one stage, Ivanova was so close to him on a plane that she could see the Pin code for his phone. Operation 3 This targeted a man called Bergey Ryskaliyev in November 2021, the court heard. Mr Ryskaliyev is a Kazakhstan national and former politician. He fled to the United Kingdom where he was later granted asylum. There is and was a clear motive for Russia to develop relations with Kazakhstan, the court heard. Prosecutors said that targeting a political dissident on behalf of Kazakhstan cultivates those relations by providing Kazakhstan with what it might consider to be assistance. Operation 4 This involved plans for disruptive activity at the Kazakh embassy in London in September 2022. The court heard that the plan was to stage a demonstration outside the embassy - a ""fake protest"" - to create a pretence that they were in possession of genuine intelligence about those responsible, which they would then pass on to the Kazakhstan intelligence to try to gain favour with Kazakhstan on behalf of Russia. Operation 5 This involved surveillance at the Patch Barracks, a US Military Base in Stuttgart in late 2022. This is a US military airbase, which jurors heard was believed by the defendants to be a location where Ukrainian forces were being trained in the use of surface to air weapons, at the very time of Russia's invasion into Ukraine. Prosecutors say the defendants' plan was to target the airbase using a range of highly sophisticated technology designed to capture key intelligence about those present on the base. Operation 6 Jurors were told this plan was targeting a man called Kirill Kachur. He is a Russian national who spent time in Montenegro who was employed by the Investigative Committee of Russia but left the country in 2021 and was designated as a ""foreign agent"" by Russia in November 2023.",Bulgarians guilty of spying for Russia in the UK,"Daniel De Simone, Amy Walker",BBC News,2025-03-07T14:48:02,2025-03-07T14:59:37,gemini-2.0-flash

https://abc7ny.com/post/suffolk-county-brush-fire-breaks-sunrise-highway-long-island/15993587/,"SUFFOLK COUNTY, Long Island (WABC) -- Massive, wind-whipped brush fires are raging across parts of Long Island's Pine Barrens region on Saturday, prompting a large emergency response to control the blazes that led to a local State of Emergency in the town of Southampton in Suffolk County. Flames from the brush fires started around 1 p.m. Saturday along Sunrise Highway and continued to burn into the evening. The Southampton Town Police Department said Sunrise Highway reopened just before 9:30 p.m. Saturday after the blaze forced roads to be shut down. Patty Lucci had been driving along Sunrise Highway and ventured into the woods because she is a retired police officer and was worried a car had veered off the road and caught fire. She realized minutes later what this really was. ""It's jumping trees at this point, and it's moving pretty fast,"" Lucci said, ""The winds were insane. It got to a point where I had to walk backwards away from the smoke coming towards me because I couldn't breathe."" Authories say the area involved stretched three miles long by one mile wide from Center Moriches towards Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach. It was on the South Side of Sunrise Highway as smoke crept perilously toward that airport -- ironically air national guardsmen who saw it were at the ready and were available to start fighting the fire with water from above. ""You never wanna see something like this happen, but it's really good that it did happen within sight of the National Guard because they reacted immediately,"" said Terence O'Leary of NYS Homeland Security and Emergency Services. Throughout the evening, brush trucks drove through the thick of it, putting water on the hot spots, which are hard to contain. The Westhampton fire was 80 percent contained as of Saturday evening as the Air National Guard conducts air drops to control the flames. One firefighter suffered a second-degree burn to his face. He was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital. Two commercial structures nearby were damaged. The combination of low relative humidity and northwest winds gusting 30 to 35 mph have created tinderbox condition across the Tri-State, the fires coming as the National Weather Service put out an alert for the elevated risk of fire spread on Saturday. ""With this wind, a spark will simply ignite it. This is something that we're gonna have to watch probably over the next few days,"" said Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine. Nearly one hundred different fire departments and EMS Units from Nassau and Suffolk Counties all pitched in to help, but at this point there was no loss of life. ""There are no residents at this time in the line of fire, but we are monitoring that very closely from the air and you will know by telephone, you will know by knocks on your door if that changes,"" said Southampton Police Chief James Kiernan. The Town of Southampton asked resident to refrain from any and all outdoor recreational fires during the next 24 hours due to high winds and the danger of wildfires. Hochul released a statement assuring that any resources needed would be dispatched to fight the fires. ""We are in close communication with local partners on Long Island to coordinate assistance and make sure they have the resources they need to protect their communities,"" Gov. Kathy Hochul said. In additional to the National Guard, Hochul said New York has dispatched ""personnel from the Office of Emergency Management, Office of Fire Prevention and Control, Department of Transportation, Department of Environmental Conservation, State Parks and the New York State Police to assist Suffolk County's response to this crisis."" ""Public safety is my top priority, and I'm committed to doing everything possible to keep Long Islanders safe,"" Hochul said in the statement. ---------- * More Long Island news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts * Follow us on YouTube  Submit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-trump-saudi-arabia-talks-kursk-battlefield-war/33341436.html,"Russian forces have carried out more than 2,100 aerial strikes on Ukraine over the past week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on March 9, as Russia has stepped up attacks on its neighbor and reported battlefield gains ahead of Kyiv's high-stakes talks with US representatives in Saudi Arabia. It comes as US President Donald Trump questioned the long-term viability of Ukraine itself. When asked in a Fox Business TV interview whether he was worried that decreased US support for Ukraine could endanger that country's survival, he responded: ""Well, it may not survive anyway."" ""But, you know, we have some weaknesses with Russia -- you know, it takes two,""Trump added. Zelenskyy said in a social media post that Russian forces this week deployed 1,200 guided aerial bombs, nearly 870 attack drones, and more than 80 missiles of various types. The Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, announced the recapture of several villages and towns on March 9 in its Kursk region -- as well as new settlements in eastern Ukraine -- with unconfirmed reports that thousands of Ukrainian troops risk being encircled by Russian forces. It comes a day after Russian air strikes killedat least 50 peoplein the eastern Donetsk region, according to local officials, with at least 11 deaths reported in the city of Dobropillya. ""Such strikes show that Russia's goals are unchanged,"" Zelenskyy wrote on social media late on March 8. ""Therefore, it is very important to continue to do everything to protect life, strengthen our air defense, and increase sanctions against Russia.” No media source currently available The series of strikes and battlefield pressure represent another setback for Kyiv ahead of crucial talks with the United States next week in Saudi Arabia, where Ukrainian officials will meet with their US counterparts for negotiations around how to end the three-year war. The Institute For The Study of War, a Washington-based think tank that tracks battlefield developments, said Russian forces have ""intensified their multidirectional campaign to eliminate the remaining Ukrainian salient in Kursk"" in the last two days. According to DeepState, an open-source military tracker linked to the Ukrainian Army, the Russian moves followed a ""breach"" in Ukrainian defense lines near the town of Sudzha, which remains under Kyiv's control but is facing growing pressure from Russian units. Pro-Russian war bloggers who closely track frontline developments in the war also reported that Russian special forces walked inside a gas pipeline to strike Ukrainian units from the rear in Kursk late on March 8 to gain a foothold outside of Sudzha. According to the reports, the pipeline was used to surprise Ukrainian units and cut off their supply lines as the Kremlin pours more manpower into kicking Kyiv out of Russian territory. RFE was not able to independently verify the accounts, but Ukrainian officials confirmed that Russian ""sabotage and assault groups"" used the pipeline to get access to Sudzha. ""At present, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked, and destroyed. The enemy's losses in Sudzha are very high,"" Ukraine's General Staff said in a Telegram post on March 8. Ukraine aimed to hit back by launching a drone overnight at an industrial facility in the Russian region of Chuvashia, some 1,300 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The strike is one of the deepest yet into Russian territory by a Ukrainian drone, and it hit its target but caused no casualties, according to Russian authorities. Ousting Ukrainian forces from Kursk with the talks in Saudi Arabia approaching looks to be part of Moscow's strategy. In August 2024, thousands of Ukrainian soldiers seized roughly 1,300 square kilometers of Russia's western Kursk region, a move which Kyiv later characterized as an attempt to gain a bargaining chip for future negotiations and draw Russian troops away from the front line in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces have managed to claw back large chunks of territory in Kursk, but Ukraine has retained a foothold that now risks being shrunk down further leading into the key talks. With his attention fixed on the upcoming talks, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ""fully committed"" to having a constructive dialogue with US representatives in Saudi Arabia next week over a potential peace settlement. ""Ukraine has been seeking peace from the very first second of this war. Realistic proposals are on the table. The key is to move quickly and effectively,"" he posted on X.The Ukrainian president said he will travel to Saudi Arabia and meet with Saudi Prince Muhammad bin Salman on March 10. Afterward, a delegation of Ukrainian diplomatic and military representatives will stay for a March 11 meeting with a US negotiating team.

https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-china-trump-xi-trade-war-debaa669593271d79658bb8b9ce42572,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The leaders of both Canada and Mexico got on the phone with President Donald Trump this past week to seek solutions after he slapped tariffs on their countries, but China’s president appears unlikely to make a similar call soon. Beijing, which unlike America’s close partners and neighbors has been locked in a trade and tech war with the U.S. for years, is taking a different approach to Trump in his second term, making it clear that any negotiations should be conducted on equal footing. China’s leaders say they are open to talks, but they also made preparations for the higher U.S. tariffs, which have risen 20% since Trump took office seven weeks ago. Intent on not being caught off guard as they were during Trump’s first term, the Chinese were ready with retaliatory measures — imposing their own taxes this past week on key U.S. farm imports and more. “As Washington escalates the tariff, Beijing doesn’t see other options but to retaliate,” said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank. “It doesn’t mean Beijing doesn’t want to negotiate, but it cannot be seen as begging for talks or mercy.” As the world’s second-largest economy, China aspires to be a great power on both the regional and global stage, commanding respect from all countries, especially the United States, as proof that the Communist Party has made China prosperous and strong. After the U.S. this past week imposed another 10% tariff, on top of the 10% imposed on Feb. 4, the Chinese foreign ministry uttered its sharpest retort yet: “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.” The harsh rhetoric echoed similar comments in 2018, when Trump launched his first trade war with China and it scrambled to line up tit-for-tat actions. Beijing’s leaders have since developed a toolkit of tariffs, import curbs, export controls, sanctions, regulatory reviews and measures to limit companies from doing business in China. All are designed to inflict pain on the U.S. economy and businesses in response to the American measures. That allowed the Chinese government to react swiftly to Trump’s recent across-the-board doubling of new tariffs on Chinese goods by rolling out a basket of retaliatory measures, including taxing many American farm goods at up to 15%, suspending U.S. lumber imports and blacklisting 15 U.S. companies. Beijing showed restraint in its response to leave room for negotiation, analysts say. Xi Jinping’s leadership of the ruling Communist Party spans both of Trump’s terms, giving Beijing more continuity in its planning. He is the one who decided it’s not yet time to speak with Trump, said Daniel Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “That’s not a scheduling issue, it’s leverage for China,” said Russel, who previously served as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. “Xi won’t walk into a call if there’s a chance he’ll be harassed or humiliated and for both political and strategic reasons, Xi won’t play the role of a supplicant.” “Instead, China is hitting back promptly — but judiciously — to each set of tariffs,” Russel said. At his annual press conference Friday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that “no country should fantasize that it can suppress, contain China while developing good relations with China.” “Such two-faced acts not only are bad for the stability of bilateral relations but also will not build mutual trust,” Wang said. He added that China welcomes cooperation with the U.S., but noted that “if you keep pressuring, China will firmly retaliate.” Scott Kennedy, a trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Chinese this time are “not psychologically shocked” by Trump’s “shock-and-awe” tactics. “They’ve seen this before,” Kennedy said. “These are the kind of things that they’ve anticipated.” China’s economy has slowed but is still growing at nearly a 5% annual pace, and under Xi, the party is investing heavily in advanced technology, education and other areas. It has stronger trade ties with many other countries than during Trump’s first term and has diversified where it gets key products, for example, buying most of its soybeans from Brazil and Argentina instead of the U.S. In turn, the percentage of Chinese goods sold to the U.S. has fallen. “They are better prepared to absorb the effect of the shocks, compared to several years ago,” Kennedy said. Meanwhile, more than 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the U.S., and Canada sends 75% of its exports here. China has learned from its previous dealings with Trump, Russel said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum are facing a reversal of Trump’s previous trade policies, with tariffs imposed and then postponed twice on at least some goods. “Beijing has seen enough to know that appeasing Trump doesn’t work,” Russel said. In the first go-around, Trudeau and Sheinbaum “bought a little time, but the pressure only came roaring back stronger.” Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump in December after the president-elect threatened tariffs. But in announcing retaliatory tariffs Tuesday, Trudeau sternly warned: “This is a time to hit back hard and to demonstrate that a fight with Canada will have no winners.” Sheinbaum also has said that “no one wins with this decision.”",China learned from Trump's first trade war and changed its tactics when tariffs came again,Didi Tang,AP News,2025-03-09T05:03:00,2025-03-09T01:03:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.axios.com/2025/03/09/us-trump-israel-hamas-gaza-talks,"White House envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to travel to Doha on Tuesday evening in an effort to broker a new hostage-release and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, two U.S. officials said. Why it matters: The talks would be the first since President Trump took office and since the original agreement between Israel and Hamas that established a 42-day ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of 33 hostages in its first phase, which ended one week ago. Witkoff is expected to join Qatari and Egyptian mediators and negotiators from Israel and Hamas who will begin talks on Monday. The Trump administration is pushing for a deal that would lead to the release of all remaining hostages, extend the ceasefire until after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover and possibly lead to a long-term truce that would end the war. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces have confirmed 35 are dead. Israeli intelligence believes 22 are still alive and the status of two others is unknown. Among the remaining hostages are five Americans, including 21-year-old Edan Alexander who is believed to be alive. Driving the news: Axios reported earlier this week that Trump's envoy for hostage affairs Adam Boehler has been holding direct talks with Hamas officials. Their last meeting took place last Tuesday. During the talks, Boehler discussed the possible release of Alexander and the remains of four other American hostages as a way to launch a broader deal on the release of all remaining hostages and a long term truce. State of play: Witkoff is expected to travel to Doha after participating in a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. It is unclear if he is going to meet with Hamas officials or only with Israeli negotiators and Qatari and Egyptian mediators. A senior Israeli official said Witkoff wanted to get all the parties in one place for several days of intense negotiations in an effort to reach a deal. A Hamas delegation held talks in Cairo on Saturday with the director of the Egyptian intelligence service about the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. Hamas said in a statement it urges all parties to implement their commitment to the original deal and begin negotiations over its second phase immediately. Israel has so far refused to seriously discuss the second phase of the deal. Hamas also said it stressed to the Egyptian officials that it is ready to form a committee of ""national independent personalities"" to govern Gaza until elections are held. Such a step would mean Hamas would give up its control over the civilian governance in Gaza. What to watch: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting with a group of senior ministers and the heads of the security services on Saturday to discuss the next steps in the Gaza deal.

The Qatari ambassador to Austria, Jassim Yacoub al-Hammadi, delivered a statement on the matter during a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna earlier this week. Israel has never publicly acknowledged that it possesses nuclear weapons, but is widely believed to have around 90 in its arsenal, according to an assessment from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in June 2024. “Hammadi underscored the need for the international community and its institutions to uphold their commitments under resolutions of the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, the IAEA, and the 1995 Review Conference of the NPT, which called on Israel to subject all its nuclear facilities to IAEA safeguards,” the Qatari statement says. The Qatari ambassador also appealed for “intensified international efforts” to bring Israel into the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear state,” the foreign ministry says, adding that “all Middle Eastern countries, except Israel, are parties to the NPT and have effective safeguard agreements with the Agency.”",Qatar calls to bring ‘all of Israel’s nuclear facilities’ under supervision of UN nuclear watchdog,ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-03-08T23:26:46,2025-03-08T23:26:46,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-845209,"Israel denied on Saturday claims by Hamas of “positive indicators” for launching talks over the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. The Hamas statement came after US officials held direct talks with the terrorist group in Doha on Tuesday about releasing more American hostages. Israeli officials were not enthusiastic about the talks. Meanwhile, demonstrators at a Tel Aviv rally are pressing the government to agree to the continuation of the deal that will allow all of the hostages to be returned. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday evening was holding a telephone situational assessment regarding negotiations on the deal. The security cabinet, which will convene on Sunday, is expected to approve the expansion of the voluntary exit option for Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to other countries through an authority that Defense Minister Israel Katz will establish. The decision to establish this authority follows US President DonaldTrump’sstatements on the need to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza for other countries. An Israeli official clarified: “The authority will be subject to international law.” The authority will include representatives from several ministries including Justice, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Finance, Transportation, and Strategic Affairs, as well as representatives from the IDF, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Shin Bet (Israel Security Service), the National Security Council, and the Israel Police. The authority will also be able to coordinate its operations with international organizations and other relevant parties. Until now, Israel has allowed Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip for other countries for medical treatment, for humanitarian reasons. The current goal is to enable the departure of Palestinians in much larger numbers. Katz announced on February 17 that he intends to establish an authority for the voluntary departure of Palestinians from Gaza, and the official approval that will be granted by the cabinet will allow the expansion of voluntary movement for Palestinians from the Strip. According to the proposal to be presented to the ministers, the authority “will facilitate the controlled movement of Palestinians within Israel for their exit to other countries, provide security and escort for their movement, establish a designated travel route and pedestrian checks at Gaza border crossings, and create infrastructure to allow land, sea, and air passage to destination countries.” Israel is preparing to facilitate the voluntary movement of Palestinians from Gaza to another country via the Ashdod Port and Ramon Airport. Some even claim that once this option is made available, “thousands of Palestinians will leave Gaza every day.” Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich toldThe Jerusalem Postthat the “US is working intensely to find other countries that will agree to take in Palestinians from Gaza.”",Hamas claims 'positive indicators' for new ceasefire talks with Israel,"JERUSALEM POST STAFF, Amichai Stein",The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-08T12:34:00,2025-03-08T21:17:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-845221,"Iran has said it prefers a one-state solution to the conflict in Gaza rather than a recent plan put forward by Arab states after a meeting in Cairo last week. Tehran expressed this view at an Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference, where foreign ministers of various Muslim countries had gathered. This is a pivotal time in the region. The ceasefire in Gaza is still holding, Hamas has rejected Israel’s attempts to extend the first phase of a hostage deal, US President Donald Trump’s administration has engaged in direct talks with the terror group, and the Islamic Republic and the Arab states oppose his plan for re-settling Gazans. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said at the OIC that thetwo-state solution “will not secure Palestinian rights, emphasizing Tehran’s support for the establishment of one state representing all the original inhabitants of Palestine.” He said, “With due respect to the views of some brotherly countries on the two-state solution, the Islamic Republic of Iran maintains its view that this solution will not lead to the realization of the rights of the Palestinian people.” Iran has lost some of its influence in the Middle East after the fall of the Assad regime and the weakening of its proxies throughout the Middle East. It is now trying to claw this power back. “In our view, ‘one democratic state’ representing all the original inhabitants of Palestine is the only viable solution,” the Iranian foreign minister said. “Given the Israeli regime’s persistent defiance of the UN Charter, its designation of the UN secretary-general as persona non grata, the complete obstruction of UNRWA’s operations, and the unprecedented tragic loss of hundreds of UN staff in Palestine, it is imperative to continue our endeavors for Israeli regime’s expulsion from the United Nations,” Iran said at the OIC. The country’s state media published the foreign minister’s entire speech, indicating its importance in their eyes. Tehran says it has “uncompromising support” for the “cause of Palestine.” “While the Islamic Republic of Iran supports the present resolution, and without prejudice to the foregoing, it would like to put on record the following reservations on the content of the outcome of this meeting, details of which will be communicated later with the secretariat [of the OIC],” the Iranians’ said. Iran says it doesn’t want the OIC to be construed as recognizing the “Zionist regime.” Its foreign minister went on to say that the country “earnestly hopes that this auspicious meeting will inspire the international community to take meaningful action to advance justice and peace for the people of Palestine. May this gathering be a renewed commitment to their honorable cause.” Iran is thus trying to claw back some role in the Islamic world. It is obviously concerned that the Saudi Arabian and Egyptian proposal at the Arab League for Gaza could end with moderation or the replacement of Hamas. Iran would thus lose out in Gaza as well.","Iran seeks greater Islamic role, rejects Arab-led postwar Gaza efforts",SETH J.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/irans-khamenei-says-tehran-will-not-negotiate-under-us-bully-pressure/,"Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that Tehran will not be bullied into negotiations, a day after US President Donald Trump said he had sent a letter to the country’s top authority to negotiate a nuclear deal. In a meeting with senior Iranian officials Saturday, Khamenei said the aim of Washington’s offer for negotiations was to “impose their own expectations,” Iranian state media reported. “The insistence of some bully governments on negotiations is not to resolve issues, but to dominate and impose their own expectations,” he said. “Talks for them is a path to have new expectations, it is not only about Iran’s nuclear issue. Iran will definitely not accept their expectations.” In an interview with Fox Business Friday, Trump said, “There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal,” to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Trump said that while he would “rather negotiate a deal with Iran” to resolve the issue of its nuclear weapons program, “the other alternative is you have to do something, because Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.” There will be “some interesting days ahead with Iran,” Trump said. “We are down to the final moments. We can’t let them have a nuclear weapon. Something is going to happen very soon,” Trump said. “I would rather have a peace deal than the other option, but the other option will solve the problem.” In response to Khamenei’s comments, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes reiterated almost word for word the choice of negotiations or military action that Trump said he had presented to Iran. “We hope the Iran Regime puts its people and best interests ahead of terror,” Hughes said in a statement. While expressing an openness to a deal with Tehran, Trump has reinstated a “maximum pressure” campaign that was applied during his first term to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports to zero. During his first 2017-2021 term as president, Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark deal between Iran and major powers that placed strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. After Trump pulled out in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, Iran breached and far surpassed those limits. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has said time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on Iran’s activities, as Tehran continues to accelerate its enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade. Tehran insists its nuclear work is solely for peaceful purposes. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told AFP on Friday that the country’s nuclear program cannot be destroyed in a military attack. “Iran’s nuclear program cannot be destroyed through military operations… this is a technology that we have achieved, and the technology is in the brains and cannot be bombed,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation meeting in Jeddah. He also said an Israeli attack on Iran would set off a wider conflict in the Middle East. “I believe that if an attack on Iran were to take place, this attack could turn into a widespread fire in the region,” Araqchi added. Meanwhile, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani warned that an attack on Iran’s Gulf coast nuclear facilities would leave countries across the region without water. In an interview with right-wing United States media personality Tucker Carlson, who is close to Trump, the premier said Doha had simulated the effects of an attack. The sea would be “entirely contaminated,” and Qatar would “run out of water in three days,” he said. “No water, no fish, nothing… no life,” Sheikh Mohammed added. Qatar, which sits 190 kilometers (120 miles) south of Iran, relies heavily on desalination for its water supply, as do other Gulf Arab countries in the arid desert region. Iran has a nuclear power plant at Bushehr on the Gulf coast, though its uranium enrichment facilities, key to building atomic weapons, are located hundreds of kilometers inland.",Iran’s Khamenei says Tehran will not negotiate under US ‘bully’ pressure,Agencies,The Times of Israel,2025-03-08T17:37:29,2025-03-08T21:57:09,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/syria-alawites-sectarian-killings-coast-assad-hts-610cdee1d5762d3ecb75c700fb7cf5f2,"BEIRUT (AP) — The death toll from two days of clashes between Syrian security forces and loyalists of ousted President Bashar Assad and revenge killings that followed has risen to more than 1,000, a war monitoring group said Saturday, making it one of the deadliest acts of violence since Syria’s conflict began 14 years ago. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in addition to 745 civilians killed, mostly in shootings from close distance, 125 government security force members and 148 militants with armed groups affiliated with Assad were killed. It added that electricity and drinking water were cut off in large areas around the city of Latakia. The clashes, which erupted Thursday, marked a major escalation in the challenge to the new government in Damascus, three months after insurgents took authority after removing Assad from power. The government has said that they were responding to attacks from remnants of Assad’s forces and blamed “individual actions” for the rampant violence. The revenge killings that started Friday by Sunni Muslim gunmen loyal to the government against members of Assad’s minority Alawite sect are a major blow to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the faction that led the overthrow of the former government. Alawites made up a large part of Assad’s support base for decades. Residents of Alawite villages and towns spoke to The Associated Press about killings during which gunmen shot Alawites, the majority of them men, in the streets or at the gates of their homes. Many homes of Alawites were looted and then set on fire in different areas, two residents of Syria’s coastal region told the AP from their hideouts. They asked that their names not be made public out of fear of being killed by gunmen, adding that thousands of people have fled to nearby mountains for safety. Residents of Baniyas, one of the towns worst hit by the violence, said bodies were strewn on the streets or left unburied in homes and on the roofs of buildings, and nobody was able to collect them. One resident said that the gunmen prevented residents for hours from removing the bodies of five of their neighbors killed Friday at close range. Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of Baniyas who fled with his family and neighbors hours after the violence broke out Friday, said that at least 20 of his neighbors and colleagues in one neighborhood of Baniyas where Alawites lived, were killed, some of them in their shops, or in their homes. Sheha called the attacks “revenge killings” of the Alawite minority for the crimes committed by Assad’s government. Other residents said the gunmen included foreign fighters, and militants from neighboring villages and towns. “It was very very bad. Bodies were on the streets,” as he was fleeing, Sheha said, speaking by phone from nearly 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from the city. He said the gunmen were gathering less than 100 meters from his apartment building, firing randomly at homes and residents and in at least one incident he knows of, asked residents for their IDs to check their religion and their sect before killing them. He said the gunmen also burned some homes and stole cars and robbed homes. The Observatory’s chief Rami Abdurrahman said that revenge killings stopped early Saturday. “This was one of the biggest massacres during the Syrian conflict,” Abdurrahman said about the killings of Alawite civilians. The previous figure given by the group was more than 600 dead. No official figures have been released. A funeral was held Saturday afternoon for four Syrian security force members in the northwestern village of Al-Janoudiya after they were killed in the clashes along Syria’s coast. Scores of people attended the funeral. Syria’s state news agency quoted an unnamed Defense Ministry official as saying that government forces have regained control of much of the areas from Assad loyalists. It added that authorities have closed all roads leading to the coastal region “to prevent violations and gradually restore stability.” On Saturday morning, the bodies of 31 people killed in revenge attacks the day before in the central village of Tuwaym were laid to rest in a mass grave, residents said. Those killed included nine children and four women, the residents said, sending the AP photos of the bodies draped in white cloth as they were lined in the mass grave. Lebanese legislator Haidar Nasser, who holds one of the two seats allocated to the Alawite sect in parliament, said that people were fleeing from Syria for safety in Lebanon. He said he didn’t have exact numbers. Nasser said that many people were sheltering at the Russian air base in Hmeimim, Syria, adding that the international community should protect Alawites who are Syrian citizens loyal to their country. He said that since Assad’s fall, many Alawites were fired from their jobs and some former soldiers who reconciled with the new authorities were killed. Under Assad, Alawites held top posts in the army and security agencies. The new government has blamed his loyalists for attacks against the country’s new security forces over the past several weeks. France expressed “its deep concern” over recent violence in Syria. Paris “condemns in the strongest possible terms atrocities committed against civilians on the basis of religion grounds and against prisoners,” its foreign ministry said in a statement Saturday. France urged Syrian interim authorities to make sure independent investigations “shed full light on these crimes.” The most recent clashes started when government forces tried to detain a wanted person near the coastal city of Jableh, and were ambushed by Assad loyalists, according to the Observatory. ___ Omar Albam in Al-Janoudiya, Syria and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report.",Worst violence in Syria leaves more than 1000 people dead in two days,"Bassem Mroue, Sarah El Deeb",AP News,2025-03-08T14:47:48,2025-03-07T22:34:41,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.kyivpost.com/post/48474,"On the occupied territories of Ukraine, Russia has forcibly issued 3.5 million Russian passports to local residents, British Defence Intelligence reported Friday. According to the intelligence report, on March 4, Russian leader Vladimir Putin claimed that Russia had completed the issuance of passports to Ukrainians living in Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia. Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official. Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev reported that 3.5 million Russian passports had been issued to Ukrainians in occupied territories – an increase from the 2.8 million reported in March 2024. British intelligence also states that Russia coerces residents of occupied Ukrainian territories into obtaining Russian passports by tying them to essential services, including social benefits, healthcare, and financial transactions. Passport holders are also automatically subject to conscription into the Russian army. Those who refuse Russian citizenship face the risk of property confiscation. Russia has had a policy of forced passportization of Ukrainian citizens in occupied territories since it invaded Ukraine in 2014, a process that has only increased since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Mykhailo Savva, an expert at the Center for Civil Liberties, told Kyiv Post that this is a gross violation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Persons in Time of War. Andriy Yusov, a representative of Ukraine’s military intelligence (HUR), told Kyiv Post: “They are threatening to send them deeper [into Russia], and people are afraid that they will be sent to Siberia.” Yusov also said Russia uses deportations “for the illegal seizure of property of Ukrainians in the occupied territories.” He added: “The aggressor country is interested in mobilization resources, labor force and children.” Russian forces have set up a new 1,000-person filtration camp in which to process the residents of Ukrainian territories that Moscow occupied in 2024. The CNS report says that the population from these areas are being forcibly taken there to check for any cooperation with Ukraine’s defense forces, after which, once their loyalty is assured, they are compulsorily issued with Russian passports. Russian authorities have been stepping up pressure on Ukrainians in the occupied territories since the beginning of the month when its Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the end of the issuing of passports in the occupied territories and warned that refusal to obtain a Russian document could result in deportation or other repressive measures.",Russia’s Passport Push: 3.5M Ukrainians Coerced to Accept Citizenship,Kyiv Post,Kyiv Post,2025-03-08T08:13:00,2025-03-08T08:13:00,gemini-2.0-flash

At least 11 people have been killed and 30 injured, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin initially reported, noting that more people could be trapped under the rubble. Some eight apartment buildings have been damaged, the official statement said. Later in the day, he updated the number of wounded to 47. Seven of those injured were hospitalized in Dobropillia while three were evacuated to Dnipro. Among the wounded were seven children. On March 8, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in his evening address that the number of injured people rose to 50. ""It was one of the most brutal strikes, a combined one. The strike was deliberately calculated to cause maximum damage,"" Zelensky said. ""Russia proves with its cruelty that nothing has changed for them in Moscow. They are thinking not about how to end the war, but about how to destroy and capture more as long as the world allows them to keep waging this war."" Donestk Oblast declared a day of mourning in response to the attack, which was ""one of the most brutal in recent times,"" Filashkin said. Dobropillia is located 94 kilometres northwest of Russian-occupied Donetsk, the administrative center of the oblast. ""At least 8 five-story buildings, a shopping center, shopping pavilions, and 30 cars were damaged or destroyed. Some of the buildings burned down almost completely,"" Filashkin wrote on Telegram. The United States Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink called the news ""horrible,"" in a post on X and wrote, ""The civilian population continues to bear the brunt of this war."" First responders have been dispatched to the site of the attack and search and rescue operation were ongoing as of 4:30 pm. U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to halt intelligence sharing with Kyiv has sparked concerns in Ukraine that Russian missile strikes could now strike the cities without prior warning. The New York Times reported on March 6 that the freeze on intelligence sharing could hinder vital alerts about incoming Russian drones and missiles. Trump made the announcement amidst a sharp decline in relations between Kyiv and Washington, as he pressures Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to his proposed peace talks with Russia. Shortly after the freeze on March 5, a Russian Iskander ballistic missile struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, killing four people and injuring at least 30, hammering home what's at stake when Russian missiles are not intercepted.","Russian attack on Dobropillia in Donetsk Oblast kills 11, injures 50 as region declares day of mourning","Olena Goncharova, The Kyiv Independent news desk",The Kyiv Independent,2025-03-07T20:02:53,2025-03-08T19:13:24,gemini-2.0-flash

Waving to his supporters, Yoon was freed from the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, just south of the capital, 52 days after he was detained on charges of inciting an insurrection. Yoon's release came shortly after Prosecutor General Shim Woo-jung decided not to appeal the court's ruling to release the suspended president. In less than 30 minutes, Yoon arrived at his official residence in central Seoul. ""I appreciate the court's courage and determination in correcting the illegality,"" Yoon said in a statement. With his release, Yoon will be able to stand trial without physical detention.

(Yonhap) On Friday, the court said it approved Yoon's request after determining that his Jan. 26 indictment on insurrection charges, which allowed his detention to be extended, had come hours after the initial detention period had already expired. The 10-day initial detention period excludes the time documents were sent to a court for a review of whether to issue an arrest warrant, pushing back the deadline of Yoon's detention to around 9 a.m. Jan. 26, whereas the prosecution indicted him shortly before 7 p.m. that day, according to the court.

""It is a just decision and the party hopes it serves as an opportunity to correct the distorted rule of law,"" party spokesperson Shin Dong-wook said in a statement. In contrast, the main opposition Democratic Party strongly criticized the prosecution for exacerbating the nation's crisis with Yoon's release and called for the Constitutional Court to formally impeach him in its upcoming decision. ejkim@yna.co.kr(END)",(2nd LD) Impeached Yoon released from detention,Kim Eun-jung,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-08T19:01:04,2025-03-08T19:01:04,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-issues-clip-of-hostage-matan-angrest-in-apparent-effort-to-rally-israelis-for-deal/,"Hamas on Friday published a video of hostage Matan Angrest begging to be set free, in an apparent effort by the terror group to mobilize Israeli public opinion in favor of continuing the ceasefire deal amid an impasse in negotiations. In the video, the 21-year-old captive IDF soldier, taken from a tank at Nahal Oz during battles there on October 7, 2023, says he has been held for 511 days, indicating it was likely filmed last week. Angrest, whose family approved the clip for publication, says he’s been told of the impasse in talks and feels that the Israeli government is deserting the hostages. “We’re starting to lose hope,” Angrest says, his voice emotionless throughout the video. He warns against a return to fighting by the IDF, saying doing so won’t secure freedom for the remaining 59 hostages. Angrest says the only way the hostages will go free is through a continuation of the phased deal to which the sides principally agreed in January. On Saturday, the first phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas drew to a close. Talks regarding terms of a poteantial second phase were supposed to have begun on February 3, but Israel has largely refused to engage in them, as phase two requires Israel to fully withdraw from Gaza and agree to a permanent end to the war in exchange for the remaining living hostages. Instead, it has sought to advance a new proposal for an extension of the first phase through Ramadan and Passover, which ends on April 19. At the beginning of the period, Hamas would release half of the remaining 59 hostages — 24 of whom are believed to be alive — while the second half would be released at the end of the ceasefire, if the sides agree to terms for a permanent end to the war. Hostage Matan Angrest is seen in a propaganda video published by Hamas on March 7, 2025. Reflecting on his conditions in captivity in the Hamas propaganda video, Angrest says he hasn’t seen sunlight and has sufferd from the winter cold. He adds that he’s been treated “like a soldier,” and not as a regular hostage, without offering details. Pleading to US President Donald Trump to secure his release, Angrest says, “You’re the only one who has the power to influence Netanyahu.” He tells his parents and three siblings that he knows they’re fighting for him and that he can’t wait to hug and see them again. Angrest closes by calling on the Israeli public to take to the streets in droves in order to protest for the release of the remaining hostages. In a statement released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Angrest’s family said, “We are shaken by the video we just saw, in which we see our Matan looking drained and desperate after 518 days in Hamas’s tunnels.” A portrait of hostage Matan Angrest reads, ‘Wait for me to come back, tomorrow I’ll be home,’ painted by graffiti artist Benzi Brofman “Beyond the grave psychological state evident in the footage, his right hand is non-functional, his eyes and mouth are asymmetrical, and his nose is broken: according to testimonies from those who have returned, this is all due to interrogations and torture in captivity. What more proof is needed to understand that time has run out?” The family also appealed to Trump — the latest demonstration that hostages’ families believe the US president, not the Israeli prime minister, is the key to their loved ones’ release — urging him to “continue fighting for our Matan and all 58 other hostages with the same unwavering commitment and relentless determination. We must not stop until the deal is completed — only when the last hostage comes home.” On Monday the family had published the first photo of Angrest from captivity, from a previous video received from Hamas. That still photo joined an audio recording released several months back, in which Angrest begged Netanyahu to secure his release, in comments likely dictated by his captors. The family also lamented that although he was seriously wounded when abducted to Gaza, the soldier was not included in the “humanitarian” category of hostages released in the first stage of the ceasefire agreement, “because he’s an Israeli soldier.” Israel unveiled the offer to extend the ceasefire’s first stage a week ago, dubbing it the “Witkoff proposal” and saying it had been crafted by US special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff. Netanyahu’s office indicated it would be willing to hold talks on the terms of a permanent ceasefire in this framework, but the premier has long insisted that he will not accept anything other than Hamas’s complete surrender and exit from Gaza. Hamas has thus far rejected the “Witkoff proposal” — which the US envoy himself has yet to publicly endorse — insisting that it will only agree to release hostages through the framework that the sides inked in January. Meanwhile, the US began holding direct talks with Hamas in recent weeks aimed largely at securing the release of five American-Israeli hostages. Those negotiations have yet to bear fruit, leading US President Donald Trump to issue an ultimatum on Wednesday, demanding that the terror group immediately release all hostages or face destruction. Top Trump aides indicated that they expected movement toward their goal in the coming days. Trump issued the ultimatum shortly after meeting with a group of eight former hostages in the Oval Office. US President Donald Trump speaks from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on March 7, 2025. Reflecting on the experience on Friday, Trump told reporters he was surprised to learn from the released hostages he’d met that not a single one of their Hamas captors treated them with kindness. “I said, ‘Did you see anybody in there [who] was kind out of the hundreds of people that you were seeing [from] Hamas? Did some of them wink at you and say, ‘Don’t worry, you’re going to be okay, or give you a piece of bread?’ ‘No,’” Trump recalled. “I said, ‘Were there any people that were kind? I was shocked. The answer was nobody. There was nobody. Just the opposite. They’d be slapped and punched. One man broke his ribs. He couldn’t breathe for a month. It was brutal,” he said, appearing to reference the testimony of recently released hostage Eli Sharabi. “I was so surprised. Because you think there’d be a couple of people that would be kind, that would say, ‘You’re going to be okay.’ But they had none of that. It’s pretty amazing,” Trump said. Meanwhile on Friday, a group of more than 50 former Hamas hostages signed onto a letter to Netanyahu calling for Israel to continue with the ceasefire deal so the remaining captives in Gaza can return home. The 24 hostages presumed to be alive who are still held by Hamas: Top row, from left: Elkana Bohbot, Matan Angrest, Edan Alexander, Avinatan Or, Yosef-Haim Ohana, Alon Ohel.

Bottom row, from left: Matan Zangauker, Bar Kupershtein, David Cunio, Ariel Cunio, Tamir Nimrodi, Pinta Nattapong. (Hostages Families Forum) “We, who were kidnapped during the October 7 massacre, experienced on our flesh the hell from which our loved ones have yet to return. We saw the darkness, heard the horrors, breathed in the fear,” the freed hostages wrote. “We know, and are not [just] imagining, what the hostages left behind are going through. Brutal torture, humiliating hunger, sickness without treatment, abysmal loneliness — that is their reality in these moments. “Every minute there is hell, every additional moment is a potential death sentence.” The former captives urged the premier to prioritize the return of the hostages over a resumption of fighting, saying that since the weeklong truce deal in November 2023, “more hostages have been murdered than were rescued in military operations. “Israel was founded to defend the Jewish people, but on October 7, it failed,” they continued. “The only way to begin atoning for this resounding failure is to bring back all the hostages, the living for rehabilitation and the dead for a proper burial on Israeli soil.” “This may be the last chance,” the released hostages concluded.","Hamas issues clip of hostage Matan Angrest, in apparent effort to rally Israelis for deal",ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-03-07T22:56:45,2025-03-08T13:35:11,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nzyjgrwxo,"A measles outbreak in the American southwest has killed a second person, an unvaccinated adult, New Mexico health officials have said. The fatality comes roughly a week after measles took the life of an unvaccinated child in nearby Texas, the first US death from the disease since 2015. Measles, which was considered ""eliminated"" in the US in 2000, is spreading quickly in Texas, with the state identifying 198 cases as of Friday, nearly 30 more since the state's last report on Tuesday. In the same span the number of cases in neighbouring New Mexico tripled, to 30. The disease has also been reported in other states and across Canada, as well. The person who died in New Mexico was a resident of Lea County, about 50 miles (80km) from Gaines County, Texas, where the outbreak appears to be centred. Officials did not provide the person's sex or age. One in every five measles cases requires hospitalisation and about three in every 1,000 cases results in death, the New Mexico health department said on Thursday. The current outbreak killed a healthy but unvaccinated six-year-old in Texas, state officials said on 27 Feb. While the disease was declared eliminated 25 years ago, the US often sees outbreaks, which are defined as three or more related cases. Still, the two deaths are jarring to many in a country that, before last week, had not recorded anyone killed by measles since 2015. The 2015 death was the first one attributed to measles in the US since 2003. Three months into 2025, the total number of reported infections in the US has already climbed above 220. There were 285 cases over the entire year of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC has said it is monitoring the current outbreak, which is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community in Texas with low vaccination rates. While the outbreak is mostly occurring in Texas and New Mexico, measles has also recently been found in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington according to the CDC. Canada is also seeing a spike in infections, and recorded more cases in the first two months of this year than in all of 2024, the country's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said on Thursday. Measles has been found in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which Dr Tam attributed to travellers who were exposed to the disease in another country. As of Thursday, there were 227 measles cases reported this year in Canada and most of those who became ill were not vaccinated, according to the country's public health agency. The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and they also immunise people against mumps and rubella. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - who is known in part for being a vaccine sceptic - published an editorial on Sunday expressing his concern about the growing measles outbreak. ""Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinate due to medical reasons,"" he wrote in Fox News Op-Ed.",Second person dies in US measles outbreak ,Ana Faguy,BBC News,2025-03-07T12:37:59,2025-03-07T14:07:16,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/07/2003833047,"Taiwan has and would continue to improve its combat capabilities and procure military equipment based on its own national defense requirements, high-ranking government officials said today. The statements came in response to an article by Nikkei Asiathat said US President Donald Trump might pressure Taiwan into buying more weapons to make up for the trade imbalance between the two nations. Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country that has improved its combat capabilities based on its own national defense needs, not due to pressure from other countries, Premier Cho Jung-tai (åæ¦®æ³°) said. “If there is any [pressure], it is that we must strengthen ourselves to face the threat of China,” Cho said. Taiwan would consider how to enhance the combat capabilities of its military based on its need for self-reliant national defense, he said. It would also monitor the national financial situation while purchasing advanced military weaponry from other countries to upgrade its self-defense capabilities, he added. There are two types of peace: one is when we are strong enough and the other is if we surrender, Cho said. We choose to make Taiwan a stronger country, he said. The US has never purposefully sold Taiwan weapons that were not for defensive operations, but both sides have discussed what equipment is practical, Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo (é¡§ç«é) told reporters at the Legislative Yuan in Taipei. The government is procuring weapons to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait and to deter war through strength, which is a common interest with the US, Koo said. The approach is to increase defense spending by 3 percent of GDP based on defensive needs and the nation’s fiscal capacity, he said. Combat readiness preparations are not solely about procuring weapons, but also about operational and maintenance costs, Koo said. The Ministry of National Defense also goes through various channels to purchase domestically produced equipment, he said. Meanwhile, other senior military officials said that the troop strength of the nation's military was previously reviewed on a five-year basis. However, in the past few years the military has procured new equipment, established new units and reinstated the one-year mandatory service requirement, which means greater flexibility regarding deployments are needed, the officials said.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/07/2003833013,"Investments by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, å	8f°ç©	8dé	9b») in the US should not be a cause for concern, but rather seen as the moment that the company and Taiwan stepped into the global spotlight, President William Lai (è³´æ¸	85å¾·) told a news conference at the Presidential Office in Taipei yesterday alongside TSMC chairman and chief executive officer C.C. Wei (é	ad	8få	93²å®¶). Wei and US President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday announced plans to invest US$100 billion in the US to build three advanced foundries, two packaging plants, and a research and development center, after Trump threatened to slap tariffs on chips made overseas. The plans are in addition to US$65 billion that TSMC has already committed to invest in three foundries in the US, one of which has begun operations. TSMC’s achievements have ensured that Taiwan is an integral part of the international community, Lai told the news conference. The company’s accomplishments are a testament to its ability and a source of fierce pride for all of Taiwan, he said. Because of TSMC’s investments, humanity’s technological future would be realized, Lai said, adding that this is “TSMC’s moment, Taiwan’s moment and a historic moment in Taiwan-US relations.” TSMC decided to invest in the US due to increased demand from US clients, Wei said. The facility operating in the US is fully booked through 2027, including production lines that are still under construction, he added. The new investment was not made due to US pressure, Wei said. Commenting on Trump’s call to abolish the CHIPS and Science Act, Wei said that TSMC asked only for fairness and was not afraid of competition. “We are the best wherever we set up our production lines,” he said. “We are not going for the subsidies.” The decision to increase investment in the US would not affect the company’s investment in Taiwan, where 11 production lines are expected to be completed this year, Wei added. Earlier yesterday, Premier Cho Jung-tai (å	8d	93æ¦®æ³°) said that TSMC would remain Taiwan’s “silicon shield,” as its research centers are still based in Taiwan, making concerns about its expansion to other markets irrelevant. The primary concern among Taiwanese is how the Monday announcement would affect TSMC’s investments or other projects in Taiwan, Cho said. The company’s investments abroad would not change the fact that its top research and development center, and its most advanced factories are in Taiwan, he said. The government has been in close talks with the industry and understands that Taiwan’s small and medium-sized enterprises are also seeking to expand internationally, he said. The government would collaborate with industrial sectors to help take Taiwanese products to the rest of the world and jointly build supply chains with democratic partners, he said, adding that the efforts would spread the nation’s influence. The more visible Taiwan is to the world, the safer the world is, Cho added. The president’s news conference with Wei was aimed at showing that “the government stands with industry,” dispelling attempts to cast doubt on the investment, a person with knowledge of the matter said. As TSMC has borne the brunt of recent cognitive warfare operations against Taiwan, the government and TSMC held close discussions prior to the announcement of the latest investment to formulate plans and held the news conference upon Wei’s return from the US to directly address the matter, the source said on condition of anonymity.

https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250307-drc-mineral-contract-with-china-slammed-by-ngos-citing-major-losses,"A controversial mining deal between the DRC and China has come under the spotlight, as NGOs and civil society groups warn of financial losses and lack of transparency, one year after the 'contract of the century' was updated. A major mining agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and a Chinese consortium is facing renewed scrutiny, as civil society organisations allege that a recently renegotiated deal continues to put the Congolese state at a disadvantage. The CNPAV coalition – ""Le Congo n'est pas à vendre"" or ""Congo is not for sale""  – comprises of anti-corruption NGOs who claim the new terms are still heavily skewed in favour of Chinese companies, resulting in a $132 million (€124 million) loss for the DRC in 2024 alone. The group is urging the government to reopen negotiations to secure a fairer agreement. The so-called ""contract of the century"" was originally signed in 2008 under then-president Joseph Kabila, granting Chinese companies access to extensive copper and cobalt mines in exchange for infrastructure development. Renegotiated in early 2024, the agreement was meant to yield nearly $4 billion (€3.8 billion) in additional benefits for the Congolese. However, watchdogs argue that the new terms fail to rectify previous imbalances. Long road for DRC as it renegotiates minerals deal with China One of the primary concerns raised by CNPAV is the dependence of infrastructure funding on the fluctuating price of copper. Under the revised terms, the DRC is supposed to receive $324 million (€312 million) annually for road infrastructure over a 20-year period. However, these payments are only guaranteed if copper prices remain above $8,000 (€7,700) per tonne. If prices fall below this threshold, ""the state will receive less, or even nothing at all,"" warns the coalition.  Additionally, even if copper prices soar to $12,000 per tonne, the Congolese side will still receive the same $324 million, preventing the country from fully benefiting from market upswings. Eastern DR Congo grapples with Chinese gold mining firms A further criticism of the deal lies in its fixed payment structure, regardless of the volume of minerals extracted. Baby Matabishi, coordinator at theCarter Center-DRCand a member of CNPAV, highlighted the issue in an interview with RFI’s Kinshasa correspondent Pascal Mulegwa. ""Everything depends on the price of copper. There is this volatility and uncertainty of price, which doesn't necessarily guarantee that the $324 million is secured,"" Matabishi explained to RFI. The NGO also raises a key inconsistency: ""How can it be understood that a company that produces 100,000 tonnes of copper pays $324 million – and on the day it produces 200,000 tonnes or 400,000 tonnes – and then pays the same amount?"" Matabishi emphasised. Hence, the lack of a production-basedscaling mechanismmeans the DRC does not proportionally benefit from increased mining output. CNPAV has also condemned ongoing tax exemptions granted to Chinese companies, which cost the DRC at least $100 million annually. While the Kinshasa government argues that infrastructure development will offset any losses, civil society organisations claim that many promised projects remain incomplete or substandard.",DRC mineral contract with China slammed by NGOs citing 'major losses',RFI,RFI,2025-03-07T07:04:40,2025-03-07T07:04:40,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-845122,"New IDF Chief-Of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir has announced that R.-Adm. Daniel Hagari will no longer be the IDF’s chief spokesperson. Although his replacement has not yet been decided, one name that has circulated is Col. Beni Aharon, who commanded the 401st tanks brigade during the war in Gaza, with sources noting Zamir’s affinity for tank commanders like himself. Aharon has been in military academic studies since June 2024, so he is also readily available to enter a new position. It was widely presumed that Hagari would be replaced, not only because most new IDF chiefs prefer to install a close ally in the spokesperson’s position but also because he had publicly clashed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the coalition over the probe into some of the Israeli leader’s staff members for allegedly mishandling classified information relating to hostages held by Hamas, as well as regarding integrating haredim (ultra-Orthodox) into the army. The first IDF spokesperson to emerge from the navy, Hagari served as a top aide to former IDF chiefs Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot. He was also a commander at multiple levels of the elite Shayetet 13 naval commando unit, which meant his identity was kept secret for most of his career. Zamir replaced Lt.-Gen. (res.) Herzi Halevi as IDF chief of staff on Wednesday. Hagari is not the first chief spokesman to run into anger from the coalition. His predecessor, Brig.-Gen. Ran Kohav, was replaced by Halevi in January 2023, partially because elements of the Netanyahu government had turned their fire on him for sternly condemning an IDF soldier who illegally beat a left-wing activist in Hebron and for some other political controversies. Despite a court martial finding the soldier’s conduct to be clearly illegal, some politicians came to the soldier’s defense and blamed Kohav for the speed and intensity of the condemnation.","Daniel Hagari to be replaced as IDF spokesman, retire from military",YONAH JEREMY BOB,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-07T12:13:15,2025-03-08T22:29:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.dw.com/en/australia-orders-evacuations-as-cyclone-alfred-approaches/a-71853689,"Authorities in Australia have ordered thousands of people along
the country's eastern coast to evacuate due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred.

The cyclone has also caused rivers to swell and left some 80,000 homes in the states of Queensland and New South Wales without power.

Alfred, a Category 2 storm, was around 125 kilometers (80 miles) east of Brisbane on Friday afternoon and is expected to make landfall on Saturday, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said.

Residents told to 'prepare for the worst'

As Tropical Cyclone Alfred continues ""to move towards the coast, and rain and wind will intensify as we head into Friday night and Saturday,"" BOM meteorologist Jonathan How said.

While the slow-moving storm's progress has proven difficult to track, it is expected to hit land north of Brisbane, Australia's third most populous city.

Around 4 million people live along the 400-kilometer
(250-mile) stretch of coastline expected to be affected by the storm.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese urged residents in the region to ""hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.""

""When nature does its worst, Australians are at our best. We rally. We lift each other up. We look out for our neighbors,"" he told a press conference.

Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said dozens of evacuation centers had been opened ""as a last resort,"" warning that the storm already ""packed a punch"" and that conditions could worsen as the weather system approaches.

What has been the storm's impact so far?

The cyclone has brought heavy rains and high winds, flooding beaches and forcing airports in the densely populated region to close.

Public transport services in Brisbane have also been suspended, while over 1,000 schools in Queensland and New South Wales have been closed, education officials said Friday.


Flood warnings have been issued, as more than 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain have already been dumped in parts of New South Wales over the past two days.

While no deaths have been registered, one man has been reported missing after his car was swept from a bridge into a river, police in New South Wales said.

Although officials have urged residents to shelter or evacuate, Australian television images showed surfers taking advantage of the choppy seas amid wind gusts of over 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour.

""This isn't a time for sightseeing or for seeing what it's like to experience these conditions firsthand,"" Albanese said. ""Please stay safe. Be sensible.""

Cyclones are common in Australia's northwest and far northeast, it is rare that they hit so far south.

Climatologists have repeatedly warned that extreme weather events such as wildfires, floods and cyclones will become more regular and more intense because of climate crisis.

https://apnews.com/article/uganda-ebola-outbreak-14-cases-ab8a339eb2c0d482016b686c075b70ac,"KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Uganda’s Ebola caseload increased to 14 in the last week, Africa’s top public health agency said Thursday, with a new cluster emerging from a 4-year-old child who recently died of the infectious disease. Three of five new cases have been confirmed as Ebola, with two cited as probably Ebola, Dr. Ngashi Ngongo of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters. The Africa CDC reported that there was no direct epidemiological link between the new cluster and another one accounting for nine previous Ebola cases, including the first victim of the outbreak. Ebola is now spreading in five of Uganda’s 146 districts, it said. That includes Kampala, the capital, where the outbreak was declared on Jan. 30. Two Ebola deaths have been confirmed. Local health officials have not been giving regular updates on the outbreak, raising concerns about a lack of transparency. At least three hospitals in Kampala have handled confirmed or suspected Ebola cases without later informing the public of it. Dr. Charles Olaro, the director of health services in the Ministry of Health, told The Associated Press he believed the situation was under control. Officials were not required to give updates on every incident, he said. Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, and there are no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola that’s infecting people in Uganda. Ebola, which is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials, manifests as a deadly hemorrhagic fever. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. Scientists suspect the first person infected with Ebola in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat. Ugandan officials are still investigating the source of the latest outbreak. The first victim was a male nurse who died the day before the outbreak was declared. He had sought treatment at multiple facilities in Kampala and in eastern Uganda, where he also visited a traditional healer in trying to diagnose his illness, before later dying in Kampala. Uganda’s last outbreak, discovered in September 2022, killed at least 55 people before it was declared over in January 2023. Dr. Emmanuel Batiibwe, a hospital director who helped lead efforts to stop that outbreak, described the current one as “amorphous,” throwing up sporadic cases that require more serious surveillance to locate and isolate contacts. Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a trend of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease in January, and in December Rwanda announced its own outbreak of Marburg was over. Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks, including one in 2000 that killed hundreds. The 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 11,000 people, the disease’s largest death toll. Ebola was discovered in 1976 in simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.","Ebola cases in Uganda rise to 14 as new cluster emerges, posing a challenge to health workers",Rodney Muhumuza,AP News,2025-03-06T20:35:55,2025-03-06T16:35:55,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250307003300315?section=national/defense,"SEOUL, March 7 (Yonhap) -- The Air Force has grounded almost all of its aircraft after two of its fighter jets mistakenly bombed a village in a northern city earlier this week, an official said Friday. On Thursday, two KF-16 fighter jets ""abnormally"" released eight MK-82 bombs outside a training range in Pocheon, some 40 kilometers north of Seoul, during live-fire drills, leaving 15 people injured, according to military and rescue officials. As part of response measures, the Air Force has decided to impose flight restrictions on all of its aircraft, excluding those that conduct reconnaissance operations and others on emergency standby, according to the Air Force official. The flight restrictions are likely to remain until an internal investigation determines the cause of the accidental bombing, the official said, noting the results are not expected to take long. The move comes after Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Lee Young-su vowed Thursday to come up with preventative measures and require all pilots to undergo safety education as he apologized for the bombing. Pilot error is suspected to have caused the accidental bombing as one of the pilots of the jets entered the wrong target coordinates prior to takeoff, according to another Air Force official, citing an initial probe. The military has suspended all live-fire training until the exact cause of the accident is found. yunhwanchae@yna.co.kr(END)",Air Force grounds nearly all aircraft after accidental bombing of village,Chae Yun-hwan,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-07T10:14:31,2025-03-07T10:14:31,gemini-2.0-flash

President Donald Trump announced Monday the delay on tariffs against Mexico and Canada was over, and thus a 25% tax on most imports from the trade partners went into effect after midnight. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, said at a press conference Tuesday he would apply a 25% surcharge on energy exports to New York, Michigan and Minnesota and would consider restricting the electricity exports down the line if the tariffs persist. He repeatedly placed the blame solely at Trump's feet. ""A tariff on Canada is a tax on Americans,"" Ford said at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada convention Monday. ""I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I encourage every other province to do the same."" Ontario is Canada's second-largest energy producer, with most of its power coming from uranium. The province has interconnections with the provinces Manitoba and Quebec as well as three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota, and New York. Most of its imports come from Quebec and most of its exports go to New York and Michigan, according to the Canada Energy Regulator website. The tax would not begin immediately on Tuesday, a Ford representative told Bloomberg. What the Trump administration means for your wallet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter. Canada and the U.S. have enjoyed a mostly tariff-free relationship for decades. While most imports from Canada are now taxed at 25%, energy is taxed at 10%. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday Canada would respond with 25% tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of U.S. imports, effective immediately. That will escalate to another $86.2 billion worth of imports if Trump's tariffs are still in effect in three weeks. Ford said he supported Trudeau's tariffs Tuesday. He also announced he was removing American alcohol products from distribution and had canceled Ontario's contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet service Starlink. ""There's going to be unemployment, inflation is going to hit and it's going to hurt the American people,"" Ford said Tuesday.

Eight others with minor injuries have also been moved to hospitals for treatment. Authorities expect the number of those injured to rise as more people have requested treatment. Members of some 40 housesholds in the area have evacuated to a town hall away from the bombing site. Military officials said the KF-16 fighter jets taking part in a live-fire exercise ""abnormally"" released four MK-82 bombs each outside the training range in Pocheon at 10:04 a.m. Pilot error is suspected to have caused the accident, an initial investigation showed, with one of the pilots of the single-seat jets wrongly entering the coordinates for the strike target prior to take-off. The Air Force said it is conducting an investigation into the accident, headed by Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Park Ki-wan, and apologized for the damage to civilians. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Lee Young-su vowed to make the utmost effort to compensate for the damage and bolster safety education and relevant procedures. ""We will compensate to the full extent of the mental, physical and property damage inflicted upon the residents,"" Lee said in a statement, saying he feels a heavy responsibility for causing concern. It marked the first accidental bombing by South Korean fighter jets that resulted in casualties. In 2004, an Air Force F-5B mistakenly released a practice bomb over Boryeong, 138 kilometers south of Seoul, but no one was injured from the incident. Earlier in the day, South Korea and the United States held combined live-fire drills near the inter-Korean border, in a show of firepower against North Korean military threats ahead of their annual springtime Freedom Shield exercise this month. The exercise took place at the Seungjin Fire Training Field in Pocheon, just 25 kilometers south of the border, mobilizing more than 160 pieces of military hardware, including K2 tanks, K55A1 self-propelled howitzers, Apache attack helicopters and F-35A stealth jets, according to the Army. A defense ministry official said the military will suspend all live-fire drills until the exact cause of the accident is determined. Freedom Shield will take place as planned, but authorities were in talks for possible changes to on-field training, a military official said. Military officials, fire authorities and officials from the local government plan to conduct a safety inspection of the accident site early Friday. The city government of Pocheon has activated a disaster control headquarters to cope with the aftermath of the accident.",(8th LD) 15 injured after KF-16 fighter jets mistakenly drop bombs outside training range,Lee Minji,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-06T19:57:48,2025-03-06T19:57:48,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq9n48el43o,"The US is ""destroying"" the established world order, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK has claimed. Valerii Zaluzhnyi said the White House had ""questioned the unity of the Western world"" and was ""taking more and more steps towards"" Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The comments come as the US puts pressure on Ukraine to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, and after a public clash between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump. Zelensky has since said he is ""ready to work"" under Trump's ""strong leadership"", an apparent cooling in tensions welcomed by Trump - and which comes after the US paused military aid to Kyiv. But Mr Zaluzhnyi's remarks at a conference at Chatham House in London on Thursday suggest there remains discontent over the US's actions. He told an audience: ""We see that it is not only Russia and the axis of evil trying to destroy the world order, but the US is actually destroying it completely"". The Ukrainian envoy added that talks between the US and Russia - the latter of which was ""headed by a war criminal"" in President Vladimir Putin - showed the White House was making ""steps towards the Kremlin regime, fully realising that in this case Europe could be a new target for Russia"". Mr Zaluzhnyi, who took over as Kyiv's ambassador to London in 2024 following three years as commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, also suggested that Nato could cease to exist as a result of Washington's change in posture. While Zelensky has expressed a wish to bring the war in Ukraine to an end swiftly, Kyiv has voiced concerns about the Trump administration's handling of talks and the concessions to Moscow that may be made without firm security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump vowed during the US election campaign to bring the war to an end quickly, and preliminary US-Russian talks were held in Saudi Arabia last month - without European or Ukrainian representatives present. The US's decision to halt its military assistance to Ukraine and intelligence sharinghas been cast by Trump administration officials as a means of getting Kyiv to co-operatewith the US-led peace talks. Any corresponding pressure the US has been putting on Moscow to make concessions has not been made public. Zaluzhnyi said the pause in intelligence sharing, as well as an earlier decision to oppose a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine, were ""a huge challenge for the entire world"". His comments come as Politico reports that members of Trump's team held discussions with some of Zelensky's political opponents, after Trump allies suggested the Ukrainian president should stand aside as his term expired in May. Citing unnamed sources in the US and Ukraine, it says talks were held with opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and senior members of Petro Poroshenko's party, who preceded Zelensky as president. Independent opinion polls in Ukraine suggest Zaluzhnyi has the most public support with at least 70%, Zelensky has 57% support, and Poroshenko about 20%. Tymoshenko and Poroshenko both have their own red lines and share a pro-European stance. Responding to the report, Tymoshenko said her team was talking with ""all allies who can help ensure a just peace as soon as possible"", while noting elections cannot be held under Ukraine's constitution while it is under martial law. Poroshenko wrote in a lengthy statement that his party worked ""publicly and transparently"" with the US, and that meetings have focused on supporting Ukraine's war effort. While criticising Zelensky's government over its political decisions and communications with the US, he too stressed that elections could only take place after a ceasefire was signed. While the Politico article suggested the Trump administration may be seeking an alternative to Zelensky, these meetings appear to be long-standing and predate both the war and the recent straining of ties with the US.","US 'destroying' world order, Ukraine's ambassador to UK says","Aleks Phillips, Vitaly Chervonenko",BBC News,2025-03-06T12:43:11.548Z,2025-03-06T13:48:45.655Z,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-trump-canada-tariffs-921138ff86144357b36610475d37801e,"TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is unwilling to lift Canada’s retaliatory tariffs on the United States if President Donald Trump leaves any U.S. tariffs on Canada, a senior government official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The official confirmed Trudeau’s stance on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The official said Trump and Trudeau spoke by phone around midday. Other Canadian officials publicly echoed Trudeau’s position. “We’re not interested in meeting in the middle and having some reduced tariff. Canada wants the tariffs removed,” Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the leader of Canada’s most populous province, agreed. “Zero tariffs or nothing. This attack was not started by our country. This was started by President Trump. He decided to declare an economic war against our country and our province, and we’re going to hold strong,” Ford said. Trump launched a new trade war Tuesday by imposing tariffs against Washington’s three biggest trading partners, drawing immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China and sending financial markets into a tailspin. Trump put 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. A day after the new tariffs took effect, Trump said he would grant a one-month exemption for U.S. automakers. The announcement came after Trump spoke Wednesday with leaders of Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep. His press secretary said Trump told the chief executives to move auto production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs. “A number of industries have reached out to us to ask us for exemptions to the tariffs,” Vice President JD Vance said. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said exceptions might be considered — a statement that reflected a softening of the American position after the import taxes hurt the stock market and worried consumers. Ford took note of the anxiety, saying the American people “woke up two days ago when the market was crashing.” Americans “are voicing their opinion. The CEOs, the market tanked. That’s what really caught his (Trump’s) attention.” Some Canadian provinces banned the sale of American booze, including Manitoba, whose leader, Wab Kinew, mocked Trump by signing a “beautiful” order that officially removes all U.S. liquor from stores in his province. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said they are not interested in going “through this psychodrama every 30 days so.” “There’s too much unpredictability and chaos coming of the White House right now,” Joly said. “He wants to weaken us and once he has weakened us possibly try to annex Canada. He has said this in the past.” In an interview Wednesday with Bloomberg Television, Lutnick said: “There are going to be tariffs. Let’s be clear.” But he also said the president was considering offering relief to some sections of the market until April 2. On April 2, Trump plans to announce what he calls “reciprocal” tariffs to match the tariffs, taxes and subsidies from other countries. That could dramatically increase the tariff rates charged globally while maintaining the risk of broader tariffs. If the tariffs are not removed, Ford told the AP, the American and Canadian auto industries will last approximately 10 days before they start shutting down assembly lines in the U.S. and Ontario. “People are going to lose their jobs,” Ford said. Lutnick said he would talk Wednesday with Trump about the possible options regarding Canada and Mexico, saying that both countries are working to address the U.S. president’s concerns about drug trafficking. Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, noted that Trudeau called the tariffs “very dumb” at a news conference Tuesday and said Trudeau’s tough talk resonated well with Canadians. “Canada had a choice: to go along with Lutnick’s proposal or to reject it. The government opted for the latter, but that may be a negotiating ploy. It is playing well with Canadians. They are very angry with Trump,” Wiseman said. Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser to Trump who said he watched Trudeau’s news conference, told CNN on Wednesday that it would be useful if the prime minister “toned stuff down.” But Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Trudeau’s comments were likely intended to project strength. “Trump thrives on intimidation, and any sign of weakness on the part of Canada might help pave the way for more economic bullying. So that’s probably why the prime minister is showing resolve, at least in public,” Béland said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he spoke with the premiers of Manitoba and Ontario, calling it an “unnecessary and costly trade war.” “While the President may not value the partnerships that contribute billions of dollars to our economy, Minnesota does,” Walz posted on social media.",Trudeau not willing to lift retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves some tariffs on Canada | AP News,Rob Gillies,AP News,2025-03-05T16:07:20,2025-03-05T21:59:57,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/gabon-presidential-election-nguema-candidate-5a1d3364e6fcffa23424287d48d5a61c,"LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) — Gabon’s military leader announced Monday that he would run as a candidate in the oil-rich central African nation’s presidential election set for April 12. Gen. Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, who is interim president, led a 2023 military coup that toppled President Ali Bongo Ondimba, who many Gabonese accused of irresponsible governance and major embezzlement that risked leading the country into chaos. “After careful consideration and in response to your numerous appeals, I have decided to stand as a candidate in the presidential election,” Nguema said during a speech to his supporters in the capital Libreville. In August 2023, soldiers proclaimed Nguema, who was the republican guard chief and a cousin of Bongo, as president of a transitional committee to lead the country. The announcement of his candidacy came after the adoption last month by Gabon’s parliament of a new electoral code, which sets out the rules and conditions for organizing elections in the country. The legislation was contentious as it authorized military personnel to be candidates in all political elections in the country, which wasn’t possible in the past. It paved the way for Nguema to run for his first presidential term. Gabon’s constitution, which was adopted in a referendum in November, sets the presidential term at seven years, renewable once. Bongo, the toppled president, had served two terms after coming to power in 2009 following the death of his father, who ruled the country for 41 years. There was widespread discontent with his family’s reign. Gabon, a former French colony, is a member of OPEC, but its oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few — and nearly 40% of Gabonese ranging in age from 15 to 24 were out of work in 2020, according to the World Bank. Its oil export revenue was $6 billion in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",Gabon's military leader announces he will run in April presidential election,Yves Laurent Goma,AP News,2025-03-03T18:56:50Z,2025-03-03T14:56:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/japan-pm-asserts-defence-budget-independence-amid-us-nominees-push-for-higher-spending,"TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Wednesday that other nations do not decide its defence budget after U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee for a top Pentagon policy role called for Tokyo to spend more to counter China. ""Japan decides its defence budget by itself,"" Ishiba told parliament. ""It should not be decided based on what other nations tell it to do."" In 2022, Japan announced a 43 trillion yen ($287.09 billion) military build-up strategy over five years, doubling its defence budget to about 2% of the country's gross domestic product, to counter escalating security threats from China, Russia and North Korea. Elbridge Colby, the Trump administration's nominee to become under secretary of defense for policy, said Japan should increase its spending. ""Japan should be spending at least 3% of GDP on defense as soon as possible and accelerating the revamp of its military to focus on a denial defense of its own archipelago and collective defense in its region,"" Colby said in a written response to advance policy questions from U.S. senators. Japan's top government spokesperson said the nation's defence buildup prioritises quality over the size of its budget. ""What we think important is the substance of defence capabilities, not the volume or GDP ratio,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told a regular press conference. Colby admonished Taiwan and Japan for acting too slowly to raise defence spending. REUTERS JoinST's Telegram channeland get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c981w25y5wpo,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special â
82¬500bn (Â£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" orSchuldenbremse,limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a â
82¬100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra â
82¬30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of â
82¬500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; â

https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-pledge-to-trump-jordan-evacuates-first-group-of-gazan-kids-for-medical-care/,"Jordan on Tuesday evacuated the first group of Palestinian children in need of medical treatment from the war-battered Gaza Strip under a plan the king presented to US President Donald Trump last month. Images aired by state TV channel Al-Mamlaka showed Jordanian military helicopters arriving at a military airport in Amman carrying four injured children and their families. The children, two of them amputees, were taken to hospital upon arrival. Government spokesman Mohammad Momani told a news conference that the first group “of the Gazan children suffering various illnesses began arriving.” Momani said it was the start of the “implementation of the initiative that the king spoke about in Washington.” In his White House visit last month, King Abdullah II told Trump: “One of the things that we can do right away is take 2,000 children, cancer children who are in a very ill state. That is possible.” Later on Tuesday, another 29 children accompanied by 44 adults were brought into Jordan by land, a military spokesman said. Ambulances carrying them entered via the King Hussein Bridge crossing, also known as Allenby Bridge crossing, between the Israeli-controlled West Bank and Jordan. Ahmad Shehada, 13, told AFP he was eager to “get my life back” after a serious injury. The boy, whose father and other relatives died in the war sparked by the Hamas-led terror onslaught on October 7, 2023,, said he had gone to get water when “a helicopter dropped a strange object, and it exploded on us.” Shehada lost an arm and “traveled to Jordan to have a (prosthetic) limb fitted,” he said. The war has killed over 48,000 people in Gaza and left more than 100,000 wounded, according to unverified figures from the Hamas-ruled territory’s health ministry, which do not differentiate between fighters and non-combatants. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7, during which some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — were killed and 251 abducted to Gaza. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques. Israel’s toll in the ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza and in military operations along the border with the Strip stands at 410. The toll includes a police officer killed in a hostage rescue mission and two Defense Ministry civilian contractors.","After pledge to Trump, Jordan evacuates first group of Gazan kids for medical care","AFP, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-03-05T02:44:48,2025-03-05T09:36:27,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250305002400315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, March 5 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's humanitarian assistance to North Korea reached zero last year for the first time in nearly 30 years, amid Pyongyang's continued antagonistic stance toward Seoul, the unification ministry said Wednesday. Not a single humanitarian assistance program for North Korea was carried out last year, either at the government or private level, according to the ministry. It marked the first time that such aid to North Korea has come to zero since South Korea began providing humanitarian assistance in 1995, when torrential rain and flooding in the North caused severe food shortages. South Korea provided 150,000 tons of rice to North Korea at that time. Seoul's humanitarian aid to Pyongyang has since continued and peaked at 439.7 billion won (US$302.1 million) in 2007 before starting to decline as North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile development gained traction. The last such aid to North Korea was a nutrition support program for North Korean children, carried out in 2023 with a budget of 900 million won, which included 700 million won in private funding. The last direct assistance from the South Korean government was a forest pest control product provision worth 1.2 billion won in 2018. The last assistance through an international organization was food aid worth 11.8 billion won, carried out in 2020 via the World Food Program, although it remains unexecuted due to North Korea's refusal. The absence of humanitarian assistance from South Korea to North Korea came as Pyongyang continues its enmity toward Seoul, most notably marked by leader Kim Jong-un's 2023 order to designate South Korea as its primary foe. ""North Korea is not accepting most outside assistance proposals, except those from UNICEF. Its refusal of those from South Korea is stronger,"" a unification ministry official said.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/us-should-wait-for-concrete-steps-before-easing-sanctions-on-russia-says-ukraine/,"The US should wait for “concrete steps” from Russia before lifting sanctions, a senior Ukrainian official told Euractiv amid recent reports that Donald Trump could ease restrictive measures on Moscow ahead of further talks to end the war in Ukraine. Vladyslav Vlasiuk, an adviser on sanctions policy to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said that the recent “discussions” about easing sanctions were ""expected,"" as ""sanctions are not a punishment but a means of pressure."" “The right approach would be to first see concrete steps from the aggressor,” Vlasiuk added. “Easing sanctions in advance while trusting Russia’s goodwill is not an option.” Vlasiuk’s comments follow a Reuters report on Monday that the White House had tasked State and Treasury Department officials with drawing up plans to lift sanctions on Russia, the majority of which were imposed following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The report, which cited a US official and a person familiar with the matter, said the plan included proposals to ease restrictive measures on both Russian citizens and companies. In January, Trump threatened to impose further sanctions on Moscow if a ""deal"" to end the war was not made ""soon."" Following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month, however, Trump and other senior White House officials have repeatedly signalled that sanctions could be eased if progress is made toward a peace deal. US and Russian officials met twice last month, in Riyadh and in Istanbul, to discuss ending the Ukraine war. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, also said on Tuesday that Russia must be “freed” from sanctions in order for relations between Moscow and Washington to be “normalised,” according to Russia's state news agency TASS. However, Peskov said the Kremlin has “not heard any official statements” from the White House about potential sanctions relief and admitted that such discussions at the present moment are “probably premature.” Washington's warming relationship with Moscow comes as Trump has become increasingly critical of his Ukrainian counterpart, Zelenskyy, whom he accused of “gambling with WWIII” in a tumultuous exchange in the Oval Office on Friday. The US also cut military aid to Ukraine late on Monday while Zelenskyy has thus far refrained from signing a deal that would boost US access to his country's rare minerals. The EU, meanwhile, passed a 16th round of sanctions on Moscow last month, while European officials have repeatedly pledged to maintain an “independent” sanctions policy. EU envoys to Brussels will meet to discuss EU-US relations tomorrow, ahead of a special summit of European leaders on Ukraine and defence policy on Thursday.

https://www.rferl.org/a/china-russia-xi-putin-zelenskyy-trump-diplomacy/33334906.html,"After a week of runaway diplomacy around how to end the war in Ukraine that has widened rifts between the United States and other Western powers and raised new questions about the future of US assistance for Ukraine, China is looking at how it can capitalize. For Beijing, the diplomatic fissures between the United States and its European allies -- the latest of which was opened up by an Oval Office clash between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- presents new opportunities to repair its own battered relations with Europe. The fallout could also ripple out to Asia, where countries aligned with Washington, such as Taiwan, are grappling with the implications of a more transactional United States and the opportunities that could create for China as it looks to ramp up pressure and assert itself more powerfully in the Pacific. “This has been pretty unequivocally good for China,” Andrew Small, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin who previously advised the European Commission on China strategy, told RFE “Beijing sees the wider opportunities that this could bring, from Taiwan contingencies to more global cooperation with Russia to a weakened United States.” China had already been reaching out to Brussels and European capitals before the dustup in Washington that saw Zelenskyy leave the White House early without signing an important minerals deal after being berated by Trump and Vice President JD Vance. That ongoing outreach by Chinese diplomats has looked to exploit fears that US efforts to reset the relationship with Russia and quickly end the war in Ukraine could leave European countries abandoned by their ally, three European Union officials told RFE No media source currently available Beijing, which has professed neutrality but has supported Russia amid its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, is now looking to expand on its pitch and benefit from the transatlantic rift, including from Trump’s plan to hit goods made in the EU with 25 percent tariffs, which Brussels said it would retaliate against with countermeasures of its own against the US economy. Small says that this Chinese effort is still in an early “fact-finding phase” to “discover what kind of openings are available in this new context.” “Whatever China puts forward will be met with skepticism,” he said. “But Beijing thinks they will see some opportunities if they can navigate this first phase, especially if tariffs hit.” China has largely been content to remain on the margins amid the flurry of diplomatic activity since Trump took office in January, but officials have been probing the European side. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China believes all stakeholders should participate in peace talks, underscoring Europe's role in them ahead of US-Russia talks in Riyadh that did not include Kyiv or European officials. “If I was Beijing, I’d be telling the Europeans what they want to hear and one thing they want to hear is that Europe and Kyiv should be at the table to discuss Ukraine’s future,” Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, an assistant professor at National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan and a former adviser to the European Parliament, told RFE On the sidelines of the conference, retired Chinese colonel Zhou Bomade headlines during an interviewin which he floated the prospect of Chinese and Indian peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a settlement to end the war. That was followed by comments by Wang at the Group of 20 (G20) meeting of foreign ministers in South Africa where he said that the recent US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia were a “window of opportunity for peace” in Ukraine and that “China will continue playing a constructive role in the political settlement of the crisis.” Ferenczy sees these comments as trial balloons as Beijing tests how receptive its outreach will be, but she cautions that years of trade spats between Brussels and Beijing, as well as strained ties from China's economic support of Russia throughout the war and the supply of dual-use goods for its war efforts, will be difficult to shake. Beijing will also need to overcome the perception that its diplomatic efforts are more about image building than actual peacemaking. Soon after the war began, Chinese leader Xi Jinping rushed to paint China as neutral and Chinese diplomats called for peace at international forums. In 2023, Beijing issued a 12-point peace plan for Ukraine that seemed designed to set the stage for a cease-fire and peace talks, but it provided no clear roadmap to end the war and was dismissed by Western officials as setting the stage for a peace on Russia’s terms. In a similar vein, EU officials say that Beijing is yet to present any new offers to the 27-country bloc in its early rounds of outreach beyond rhetoric about an unreliable United States and the prospect of normalizing trade relations. “It’s unavoidable that we will be affected by statements from Beijing that sound good to us,” Ferenczy said. “But a less reliable United States doesn’t make China more reliable all of a sudden.” The Trump administration has said that its efforts are designed to push allies to pay a bigger share of their own defense needs, recalibrate trade relationships, and bring an end to the war in Ukraine. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also said that, if the United States were to scale back military assistance for Ukraine, it would allow Washington to focus its resources on the Asia-Pacific region, where the administration has said countering China is a priority. But there are early signs that Washington’s approach to ending the war in Ukraine will have ripple effects further east, particularly in Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing has vowed to annex if it refuses to peacefully accept unification. Taiwan has long faced the possibility of a Chinese invasion, but pressure also looks to be growing. No media source currently available On February 28, China’s Defense Ministry would not rule out the use of force against Taiwan, and its spokesman Wu Qian warned the United States that “playing sneaky tricks on Taiwan would only backfire.” Those comments came after Taiwanese authorities said they had detained a cargo ship crewed by Chinese nationals, which they believe may have severed an undersea communications cable. Following that, the Chinese military held what Taipei said was unannounced ""shooting training"" off the island’s southern coast. Taiwan’s ability to deter a potential attack hinges on whether the United States stands ready to help, and the Taiwanese government has seen US assistance for Ukraine assomething of a bellwetherfor how Washington could react in the event of a crisis with China. Ryan Hass, a former director for China on the US National Security Council, said that Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine and his recent spat with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office will no doubt cause anxiety in Taipei, but added that Taiwan’s unique position as the manufacturer of 90 percent of the world’s most-advanced semiconductors leave it in a unique position with the United States. Trump has called for Taipei to increase defense spending and said that he wants to move some of the island’s semiconductor foundries, which manufacturers the chips largely for US tech companies, to the United States. Any type of relocation, however, would be a costly and slow process. Hass says this makes Taiwan “indispensable to Trump’s goals for an American industrial renaissance” as he looks to revamp manufacturing back home. “Taiwan needs the US, but the U. also needs Taiwan,” Hasswrote on X. “Trump knows this fact. There is a complementary division of labor between US tech companies and Taiwan’s chip foundries that cannot be replaced.” The CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) visited the White House on March 3 and afterwardannounced plansto make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a leading supplier to major US hardware manufacturers, said the plan involves building five facilities in the United States in coming years.

https://bulgarianmilitary.com/2025/03/04/houthis-claim-another-mq-9-trophy-in-their-sky-high-standoff/,"On March 4, 2025, Yemenâ	ms Houthi rebels claimed to have shot down yet another U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone, an unmanned aerial vehicle valued at over $30 million, over the Hodeida district in western Yemen. According to a statement from the Houthi armed forces, their air defenses successfully targeted the drone while it was allegedly conducting hostile operations in Yemeni airspace. If confirmed, this incident would mark the 15th MQ-9 Reaper downed by the Iran-backed group since the onset of their intensified campaign in late 2023, a period that coincides with the escalation of regional tensions tied to the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. military has not yet responded to the latest claim, though officials have previously acknowledged some losses while disputing the total number of drones the Houthis assert they have destroyed. The incident, reported by Houthi-aligned media and circulating on social platforms, underscores the ongoing challenge the group poses to American aerial operations in the region. Yemeni military claims to have shot down another MQ-9 Reaper drone worth over $30 millionit would be the 15th Reaper shot down over Yemen.pic.twitter.com The MQ-9 Reaper, produced by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a cornerstone of the U.S. militaryâ	ms unmanned fleet, designed to fulfill a dual role of intelligence gathering and precision strikes. Introduced in 2007 as an evolution of the earlier MQ-1 Predator, the Reaper represents a significant leap in capability, blending advanced surveillance technology with lethal firepower. Measuring 36 feet in length with a wingspan of 66 feet, the drone is powered by a Honeywell TPE331-10 turboprop engine, enabling it to reach speeds of up to 240 miles per hour and maintain flight for as long as 24 hours, depending on its configuration and payload. Its operational ceiling reaches 50,000 feet, allowing it to loiter above targets at altitudes beyond the reach of many conventional air defense systems. This endurance and altitude make it an ideal platform for persistent surveillance over vast areas, a feature that has proven invaluable in conflict zones like Yemen, where the U.S. has long sought to monitor and counter extremist groups such as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite, the Reaper carries a multi-spectral targeting system that includes electro-optical and infrared cameras, capable of tracking targets day or night in all weather conditions. It also features synthetic aperture radar for mapping terrain and detecting movement, alongside signals intelligence equipment that can intercept communications. This array of sensors feeds real-time data to operators, often stationed thousands of miles away in facilities like Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, who control the drone via satellite link. On the offensive side, the Reaper can be armed with a variety of munitions, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and, in some configurations, GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions. With a payload capacity of approximately 3,850 pounds, it can carry up to 14 Hellfire missiles, a stark contrast to the Predatorâ	ms maximum of two. This combination of long endurance, high-altitude operation, and precision strike capability has made the MQ-9 a workhorse for the U.S. military and the Central Intelligence Agency, deployed extensively in counterterrorism missions across the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. Despite its technological prowess, the Reaper is not invulnerable, as the Houthis have repeatedly demonstrated. The groupâ	ms campaign against U.S. drones in Yemen has intensified since November 2023, when they began targeting American assets in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict, framing their actions as solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The first reported downing of an MQ-9 Reaper by the Houthis occurred earlier, in 2017 when the rebels claimed to have used a surface-to-air missile to destroy a drone over northern Yemen. Another followed in 2019, with the U.S. acknowledging the loss but offering few details. The pace of these incidents accelerated dramatically in 2023, beginning with a confirmed shootdown on November 8 over international waters off Yemenâ	ms coast, an event the Pentagon attributed to Houthi air defenses. In 2024, the losses mounted. On February 20, a Reaper was downed near Hodeida, followed by another on April 27 over Saada province, where Houthi footage showed wreckage bearing General Atomics markings. May saw two more incidents: one on May 17 in Marib province and another on May 29 in the same region, both accompanied by Houthi videos of debris. September proved particularly costly, with the U.S. acknowledging two Reapers lost on September 8 and September 18, the latter in Marib, though the Pentagon disputed the Houthisâ	m claim of a higher total. The campaign continued into late 2024 and early 2025. On November 8, 2024, videos emerged of a flaming aircraft crashing in al-Jawf province, which the Houthis identified as another Reaper, though the U.S. military described it only as an ongoing investigation. December 28, 2024, brought a confirmed downing over Al Bayda governorate, followed four days later, on January 1, 2025, by another in Marib, marking the 13th and 14th losses according to Houthi tallies. Each incident has been trumpeted by the group as evidence of their growing military prowess, often with footage of wreckage or missile launches released through their media channels. The U.S. response has typically been measured, confirming some losses while conducting retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets, including missile launchers and radar sites, as part of operations like Poseidon Archer. Yet the precise circumstances of many shootdowns remain murky, with the Pentagon occasionally attributing crashes to technical failures rather than enemy action, a claim the Houthis dismiss as propaganda. Speculation about the weapons responsible for these downings centers on the Houthisâ	m evolving air defense capabilities, bolstered by Iranian support. One likely candidate is the 358 missile, a loitering surface-to-air system first identified in Yemen in 2019. Developed by Iran, this missile combines features of a drone and a traditional missile, using a solid rocket booster for launch and a turbojet engine for sustained flight. With a range estimated at 100 kilometers and an altitude capability exceeding 10 kilometers, it is designed to engage low-flying or hovering targets like helicopters and drones. Its imaging infrared seeker and satellite navigation allow it to loiter in an area, waiting for a target to appear, making it a plausible threat to the Reaperâ	ms operational profile. The Houthis have also been linked to older Soviet-era systems, such as the SA-6 Gainful, inherited from pre-war Yemeni military stocks, though these are less suited to the Reaperâ	ms high-altitude flights. More advanced Iranian designs, like the Sayyad-2C or variants of the Taer series, could also be in play, offering ranges and guidance systems capable of challenging U.S. drones. While the Houthis claim some missiles areâ	mslocally produced,â	texperts widely agree that their arsenal relies heavily on Tehranâ	ms technology and supply lines, despite Iranâ	ms denials and a U.N. arms embargo. The repeated downing of MQ-9 Reapers over Yemen raises uncomfortable questions about the droneâ	ms role in the region and the broader U.S. strategy there. At over $30 million apiece, the financial toll of these lossesâ	mpotentially approaching half a billion dollars if the Houthi count holdsâ	maids up quickly, even for a military with a budget in the hundreds of billions. More troubling is the symbolic cost: each downed drone fuels Houthi propaganda and undermines the perception of American technological dominance. The Reaperâ	ms strengthsâ	mds ability to linger over targets and deliver precise strikesâ	malso expose its weaknesses, particularly its reliance on an unjammed satellite link and its lack of agility against increasingly sophisticated air defenses. As the Houthis refine their tactics and weaponry, possibly with Iranian guidance, the U.S. faces a dilemma. Escalating airstrikes risks further entanglement in Yemenâ	ms complex civil war while reducing drone deployments could cede valuable intelligence and strike capabilities. For now, the skies over Yemen remain a proving ground not just for the Reaperâ	ms resilience, but for the limits of American power projection in an era of persistent, asymmetric threats.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge1qq4jdxdo,"Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to work under Donald Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace days after their explosive Oval Office meeting. The Ukrainian president described the White House showdown as ""regrettable"" in a lengthy social media post in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. ""We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky – ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure – and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same,"" he wrote. ""Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal."" In his social media post, Zelensky said Friday's meeting ""did not go the way it was supposed to be"", adding: ""It is regrettable that it happened this way,"" he wrote. ""It is time to make things right. We would like future co-operation and communication to be constructive."" He also reiterated that Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the US, after the failure to do so at the Washington meeting. Ukraine woke to the news on Tuesday that the US was ""pausing and reviewing"" its military aid to the country after a breakdown in diplomacy last week. In his post, Zelensky offered an overt declaration of gratitude for the help the US has so far given to his country. ""We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,"" he wrote. ""And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins. We are grateful for this,"" he added, referring to the US anti-tank missile system sold to Ukraine during Trump's first administration. During Friday's meeting in the Oval Office, Vice-President JD Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for the military support the US had provided. ""Have you said 'thank you' once this entire meeting?"" Vance said, before Trump told Zelensky he was not being ""very thankful"". Zelensky defended himself in the meeting, and began an interview with Fox News in the hours afterwards, saying: ""I'm very thankful to Americans for all your support."" The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War III"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal – Trump told Zelensky ""come back when you're ready for peace"". Trump is due to deliver an address to Congress later on Tuesday, during which the Reuters news agency reports he plans to announce a minerals deal between US and Ukraine has been signed. A number of Ukraine's allies have commented on the latest from the Ukrainian president, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who welcomed Zelensky's ""steadfast commitment to securing peace"". It is ""vital that all parties worked towards a lasting and secure peace for Ukraine as soon as possible"", a statement from No 10 said. Likewise, French President Emmanuel Macron praised Zelensky's willingness to ""re-engage in dialogue"" with Trump, the Elysee Palace said. Days before his meeting with Zelensky, the US President had met with Macron, who travelled to Washington with a warning to Trump: ""You can't be weak in the face of Putin."" While European leaders rallied behind Zelensky following the clash, Nato's secretary general advised the Ukrainian leader to ""find a way"" to restore his relationship with Trump. Speaking to the BBC the following day, Mark Rutte said he had told him ""we have to respect"" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far. Follow live: Trump pauses US military aid to Ukraine Zelensky's statement falls short of an apology to Trump, which those in the US president's camp had called for. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin's team earlier welcomed the US's pause to military aid as likely to be the ""best"" contribution to peace. ""If the US stops, or pauses these supplies, this will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg. Trump himself has not commented on the pause to aid, nor Zelensky's response, however he did earlier berate the Ukrainian leader following his meetings with European allies at the weekend. A Sunday summit - hosted by the UK prime minister - was intended as a show of support for Ukraine. After the meeting, Zelensky said a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia was ""still very, very far away"". Trump described this as the ""worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky"", in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's backing,"" the president wrote.",Zelensky vows to 'make things right' with Trump and negotiate peace,Jacqueline Howard,BBC News,2025-03-04T13:32:28,2025-03-04T18:15:22,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-844722,"The adoption statement by Arab states of the Egyptian reconstruction plan for Gaza is entrenched in perspectives that are no longer relevant post-October 7, Israel's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. The statement came in reaction to the adoption of the plan during the Arab summit, which convened in Cairo. According to the Egyptian plan, an administrative committee of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats would govern Gaza temporarily in preparation for the Palestinian Authority's return in the Strip. ""The statement continues to rely on the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA — Both have repeatedly demonstrated corruption, support for terrorism, and failure in resolving the issue,"" the Foreign Ministry said. The ministry also stated the statement issued bore no mention of Hamas nor the October 7 massacre. ""For 77 years, Arab states have used Palestinians as pawns against Israel, condemning them to eternal 'refugee' status,"" the ministry continued. US President Donald Trump's plan for Gaza ""should be encouraged,"" instead, the ministry noted, adding it would grant ""an opportunity for Gazans to have free choice based on their free will."" ""Hamas's attack on Israel has destabilized all of the region. Its terror regime in Gaza prevents any chance of security for Israel and its neighbors.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-844701,"While the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) took a significant amount of responsibility for the disasters on October 7 in its report published unexpectedly on Tuesday, it also implicated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by implying that his policies regarding the Temple Mount, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, and the judicial reform led to Hamas’s decision to initiate its long-planned invasion. Other policies carried out under Netanyahu that the agency flagged as problematic and as contributions to Hamas’s decision to invade were his facilitation of Qatari funding to Hamas and his opposition to proposed assassination operations of top Hamas leaders at the time. Israeli intelligence has said that Qatar eventually developed two funding pipelines to Hamas. One was supervised by Israel and, at least officially, only went to Gaza's civilian needs. However, Israeli intelligence has said that another funding pipeline, especially in more recent years, circumvented Israeli oversight and went directly to Hamas. Besides the second funding pipeline, Israeli intelligence analysts have pointed out that the funding that went to civilian Gazan needs made it easier for Hamas to spend more of its existing funds on the vast terror and military operations that the IDF was confronted with in Gaza during the war. The report never mentions Netanyahu by name, and technically, some of these policies were those of then-national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Netanyahu, though, as prime minister, allowed many of the policies to continue despite having the power to stop them. Ben-Gvir vastly expanded the volume of Jewish visitors to the Temple Mount compared to prior years, violated some of the rules of what activities could be performed on the Temple Mount, publicly called for completely changing the “status quo” there, and enforced policies that worsened the treatment of Palestinian prisoners. His moves led to public condemnations by moderate Sunni Arab allies, the West, and Hamas, and to private warnings by theShin Bet. The judicial reform was also a Netanyahu policy, although just as his critics can blame him for pushing the legislation forward, so can the prime minister argue that the backlash against the reform impacted both the IDF’s readiness and Hamas’s perception of the army’s capabilities. At another key point in the report, the Shin Bet wrote that even as it was implementing its own vast reforms for its massive failures on October 7, these would be insufficient in preventing future disasters, barring changes in the interface between the political and defense echelons. Most of the report, however, was about the Shin Bet’s own failures. It did not warn about an invasion, it misinterpreted Hamas’s intentions – both before October 7 and on the day – it failed to adjust to Hamas as a sophisticated military entity, allowing Hamas to massively arm itself, and it did not recognize the depth of the harm being done to Israeli deterrence. Another blind spot was the agency’s belief on the eve of October 7 that Hamas might be focused on an attack in the West Bank, partially because its leaders carried out an unusual terrorist attack there on October 5. Conceptually wise, the Shin Bet said that it had far too much confidence in the IDF’s hi-tech border fence, was too invested in quiet and stability, and was too worried about miscalculations in pressuring Hamas that could lead to instability or an “unnecessary” war – as the 2014 conflict was viewed.",Shin Bet hints Netanyahu's policies motivated Hamas's October 7 attack,YONAH JEREMY BOB,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-04T14:29:00,2025-03-05T13:22:00,gemini-2.0-flash

Foreign backers of thePalestinian Authority(PA), which is based in the Israeli-occupiedWest Bank, have long asked for a vice-president to be appointed. Abbas, 89, has been in power since 2005 following the death of Palestinian leaderYasser Arafat. The following year he was elected to a four-year term, with no presidential vote since. The Palestinian president, addressing Arab leaders meeting in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss the post-war reconstruction of theGaza Stripand come up with an alternative toUS President Donald Trump's ""Gaza Riviera"" plan, said he would restructure the PA.

""We are fully prepared to hold general presidential and legislative elections next year, provided that the appropriate conditions are met in Gaza, the West Bank and eastJerusalem,"" Abbas said.
The most prominent among of the expelled dissidents who could be affected by the announcement is Mohammed Dahlan, 63, a former Fatah security chief in the Gaza Strip.
Dahlan, excluded from the party after his security forces were forced out of the Palestinian territory by Hamas militants, is seen as a potential key actor in the post-war governance of Gaza, now ruled by the Fatah's domestic rivalHamas.
Now based in the UAE, Dahlan has also faced corruption charges.
Abbas, a native of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, had suggested in 2024 that Arab states should send troops to help keep order in post-war Gaza, where Saudi and UAE money could help fund reconstruction.
In his opening remarks to the summit,
Abbas also insisted that the
Palestinian Authority was the only legitimate governing and military force in the Palestinian Territories.
The last Palestinian presidential election was held in January 2005, and the last legislative elections were in January 2006, before internal clashes between Hamasand Fatah froze Palestinian political life.

https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-aid-military-pause-trump-war-zelenskiy-zelenskyy/33335335.html,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that the tense Oval Office meeting with US President Donald Trump last week was ""regrettable,"" and that he is willing to work with Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve long-term peace. Zelenskyy's remarks came in a social media post on X, hours after the White House announced a pause in military aid to Ukraine, which is critical to fighting Russia's invasion. ""The meeting did not go the way it was supposed to,"" Zelenskyy said. ""It's unfortunate that it happened this way. It's time to make things right. We want future cooperation and communication to be constructive."" Saying that ""none of us want an endless war,"" he added that ""Ukraine is ready to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring long-term peace closer...My team and I are ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to achieve long-term peace."" Zelenskyy thanked the US for its support during the war and said Kyiv was ""ready"" to sign the US-proposed minerals deal, even though his remarks did not specifically address the US decision to halt aid to Ukraine. Late on March 3, senior US officials told multiple media outlets that Trump had ordered a pause in all military aid to Ukraine, piling pressure on Kyiv to fall in line with US efforts to broker a peace deal with Russia despite a lack of security guarantees for Ukraine. ""We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,"" reports quoted a White House official as saying on condition of anonymity. ""The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well."" ""This is not permanent termination of aid, it's a pause,"" Fox News quoted a Trump administration official as saying. The suspension will last until Trump determines that Ukraine's leaders demonstrate a good-faith commitment to peace, according to Bloomberg and Fox News. Speaking from Washington on March 4, US Vice President JD Vance spoke about the US decision to suspend military aid. Vance said the US needs to ""get some payback for the incredible financial investment"" it has made in Ukraine. When asked if the US would resume providing military aid to Ukraine, Vance says that ""everything is on the table"" once Kyiv begins negotiating. Reports of the suspension widened the rift between Zelenskyy and the Trump administration, which had long been troubled but split wide openat the White House meeting. The pause amplifies already deafening questions about US support for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian invasion at a time when Moscow's forces have been gaining ground for many months, albeit at a massive cost in casualties, and Ukraine struggles withmanpower problemsand other challenges in the biggest war in Europe since 1945. It is likely to add to concerns in Kyiv and among its supporters in the West that Ukraine could be pressured into a cease-fire or a peace deal that favors Moscow. Those worries increased after Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin in mid-February and then sent top officials to meet their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. The Kremlin welcomed the news. ""If itâ											 s true, then itâ											 s a decision that really could push the Kyiv regime into a peace process,â											 d Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""If the United States stops being [an arms supplier] or suspends these supplies, it will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace,"" he said. Any disruption in the flow of US arms to the front line would rapidly weaken Ukraine's chance of beating back Russia's invasion. The suspension applies to ""all US military equipment not currently in Ukraine, including weapons in transit on aircraft and ships or waiting in transit areas in Poland,"" Bloomberg reported. ""The suspension of U.S. assistance for Ukraine is a very unfortunate and significant development, but it may not have immediate impact,"" Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an expert on the Ukrainian and Russian militaries,wrote in a threadon X. ""Ukraine is far less dependent on the U.S. for day to day battlefield needs in 2025, than it was in earlier periods of the war. "" ""Much depends on the extent [to which] Ukraine has been stockpiling munitions and where Europeans can step in, although in some cases they have low inventories, and in others U.S. retains the ability to deny any transfers,"" Kofman wrote. ""The impact will probably be much more visible in a few months. The pause ""will have a bad impact, of course, if you deprive Ukraine of assistance from the United States, whether it's financial aid or military aid,"" independent military analyst Yury Federov told Current Time.

https://apnews.com/article/france-nuclear-weapons-deterrence-ukraine-russia-trump-a53dc73395455c753287ae2ecbb7a9a5,"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron says that he’s ready to start discussions on nuclear deterrence with European allies. Macron has hinted that France could help to protect other nations after U.S. President Donald Trump raised questions both about the trans-Atlantic alliance and the defense of Ukraine. While Macron’s offering has been on the table for several years, it has gained urgency after Trump’s remarks raised concerns among European NATO allies, which have for decades counted on the powerful U.S. deterrent. Here’s a look at France’s nuclear policy. What’s nuclear deterrence? Nuclear deterrence is a strategy based on the idea that the destructive force of nuclear weapons would prevent other nations’ hostile actions, particularly nuclear attacks. During the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear umbrella was aimed at ensuring that allies, especially NATO members, would be protected by American nuclear forces in case of a threat. That’s one of the reasons why many nations across the world haven’t pursued their own nuclear arsenals. France is the only nuclear power in the European Union. The United Kingdom, which is no longer an EU member but is working on restoring closer ties with the 27-nation bloc and belongs to NATO, also has nuclear weapons. In the wake of Trump’s push for Europe to carry the defense burden, German election winner Friedrich Merz recently called for a discussion on “nuclear sharing” with France. EU leaders are set to address the issue during a special summit in Brussels on Thursday, focusing on support for Ukraine and European defense. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer won’t be attending the summit. The only non-EU guest is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Protecting France and Europe France’s nuclear deterrence is strictly conceived as defensive. It is meant to protect the country’s “vital interests.” Although France is a NATO member, it independently maintains its nuclear forces, cooperating with the alliance’s broader deterrence strategy. Since a 2020 keynote speech, Macron has said that France’s “vital interests” have a “European dimension” — comments that he reiterated in recent days. “What may be new today ... is the somewhat urgent nature of these comments and how they are perceived abroad,” said Emmanuelle Maitre, senior research fellow at France’s Foundation for Strategic Research. “Obviously, faced with the feeling of abandonment felt by NATO countries, there’s some kind of logical search for what might enable them to keep some form of deterrence mission within Europe,” Maitre said. Fourth nuclear arsenal in the world Nuclear deterrence involves maintaining ambiguity about which circumstances would lead to the use of nuclear weapons, in order to prevent a potential aggressor from calculating risks — which is why France wouldn’t provide details over how it would help in defending other European countries. France “likes to remind people of its capabilities in order to be credible in its deterrence,” Maitre said. “But there’s also an element of ambiguity, because it’s not a question of telling our adversary exactly what our red lines are. No nuclear power does this.” The Federation of American Scientists, or FAS, estimates that all together, the United States and Russia possess approximately 88% of the world’s total inventory of nuclear weapons. They are followed at a distance by China, and France is in fourth position with an estimated 290 nuclear warheads. The U.K. has an estimated 225, according to the federation. The FAS notes that the exact number of weapons in each country’s possession is unknown because it’s a closely held national secret. France’s arsenal consists of ballistic missiles deployed on its nuclear-powered submarines and air-launched cruise missiles carried by long-range bombers. Maitre noted that the key for France’s strategy isn’t making a comparison with the U.S., but rather ensuring the capability to impose “an unacceptable response and damage on an adversary.” A domestic political debate Macron’s proposal to potentially use France’s nuclear arsenal to protect Europe has sparked backlash from far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally and allies form the biggest group of lawmakers at the National Assembly since last year’s legislative elections. Le Pen was quick to criticize Macron’s comments, arguing during a debate on Ukraine at the National Assembly that “sharing (nuclear) deterrence is equivalent to abolishing it” on Monday. She added: “unleashing the nuclear fire cannot be separated from national and popular legitimacy,” which is vested solely in the French president, elected by universal suffrage. In response, Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu said that France’s nuclear deterrent would remain the prerogative of the president. “Weapons production ... and use of nuclear forces are French and will stay French,” Lecornu said Monday. “While the hand on the button remains that of the head of state ... the fact remains that the way in which we contribute to the continent’s global security architecture is a proper debate,” Lecornu told French lawmakers. All European capitals “are going to ask us the question, so we want to be ready to answer.”",Macron to discuss nuclear deterrence with European allies.

While no decision has been made, anonymous sources toldBloombergthat the government of Panama is weighing the possibility of canceling the contracts. President JosÃ© RaÃºl Mulino has not yet commented on the matter. The development comesafter Rubio's visit to Panama, where he told President Mulino that steps must be taken to curb China's ""unacceptable"" influence over the US-built canal. Even though the Panama Canal is run by an autonomous entity overseen by the Panamanian government, the U.S. government claims China exerts influence through a Hong Kong-based company that operates ports on both ends of the waterway. ""People will argue, well, that's not China; that's a company based in Hong Kong. Well, a company based in Hong Kong is the Government of China. You are not a company in China if the Chinese Government doesn't control you,"" Rubio said in an interview with conservative journalistMegyn Kelly. ""If there's a conflict and China tells them 'do everything you can to obstruct the canal so that the U.S. can't engage in trade and commerce, so that the U.S. military and naval fleet cannot get to the Indo-Pacific fast enough'â		They would have to do it, and they would do it. And now we'd have a major problem on our hands,"" he added. During Rubio's visit, President Mulino announced that his government wouldwithdraw from China's signature lending program, Belt and Road Initiative, which finances infrastructure across several continents. The Panamanian leader added thatU.S. warships would be granted free passagethrough the canal, addressing a complaint by former President Donald Trump, who said the U.S. Navy was paying ""exorbitant"" rates to pass through. During his inauguration speech, Trump vowed to take back the Panama Canal. The president claimed that the U.S. has ""been treated very badly by this foolish gift that should have never been made,"" referring to an agreement with the Latin American country that would eventually lead to Panama retaining full control of the canal. He further claimed that ""China is controlling the Panama Canal"" and said, ""We're taking it back."" Trump has accused Panama of favoring China over the U.S. According toBloomberg, about 75% of the cargo transiting through the Panama Canal goes to or from the US, making it the biggest beneficiary of the route.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/03/04/2003832837,"US President Donald Trump’s confrontational policy toward China in his second term presents more of an opportunity for Taiwan than a threat, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) said. “The main focus of Trump’s second term is countering China,” Lin said during an interview on an online talk show hosted by a local political pundit that aired on Sunday night. Although countering China does not necessarily mean supporting Taiwan, the Trump administration’s stance gives Taiwan the opportunity to find common interests with the US, Lin said. “Taiwan’s foreign policy is not formulated on US interests, but is rather based on Taiwan’s interests,” he said. The government is finding common ground with Washington and focusing on promoting policies where the countries’ interests are aligned, he said. During his presidential campaign, Trump made controversial remarks about Taiwan, including accusing the nation of “stealing” the chip industry from the US decades ago, Lin said. Trump also repeatedly expressed frustration that Taipei does not pay the US to fund its defense, he added. Taiwan needs to take Trump’s words “seriously, but not literally,” Lin said. In response to Trump’s remarks, President William Lai (賴清德) last month announced that the government aimed to increase defense spending to 3 percent of GDP this year, the minister said. Lin said he is optimistic about the Trump administration’s foreign policy, as much of the Taiwan-US cooperation during the administration of former US president Joe Biden began during Trump’s first term from 2016 to 2020, and many senior members of Trump’s national security team are Taiwan friendly. “Trump 2.0 has so far shown more continuity in its policy than variability,” he said, adding that Trump’s second term is offering Taiwan “more opportunities than threats.” Meanwhile, asked about the US Department of State’s decision to remove from a bilateral relations fact sheet a line indicating Washington’s long-held stance of not supporting Taiwanese independence, and whether that means stronger support from Washington, Lin said he does not believe Taiwan needs to “overinterpret” the move. Taiwan needs to be more “practical” instead of overreacting to the wording in the fact sheet, he said. However, it is a good sign showing the need to move away from the Taiwan-US -China trilateral relationship framework established during the Cold War and view Taiwan-US and US-China relations separately so that Beijing does not have a say in Washington’s interactions with Taipei, he said.",US’ China policy offers opportunities: minister,"Staff writer, with CNA",Taipei Times,2025-03-04T00:00:00,2025-03-04T14:58:10,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-643086a6dc7ff716d876b3c83e3255b0,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trumplaunched a trade warTuesday against America’sthree biggest trading partners, drawing immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China and sending financial marketsinto a tailspinas the U.S. faced the threat of rekindled inflation and paralyzing uncertainty for business. Just after midnight, Trump imposed 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.

(AP Photo Bull) Beijing retaliatedwith tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. In an address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump repeated two different explanations for his tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He cited the trade deficits the U.S. has with both countries, but also said, “they’ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.” Trump also acknowledged there could be “a little disturbance” from the tariffs, a possible nod to the stock market’s sharp falls in the past two days as well as concerns about inflation. “It may be a little bit of an adjustment period,” he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. “You have to bear with me again and this will be even better.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his countrywould plaster tariffson over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days. “Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,” Trudeau said. President Trump imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday and doubled tariffs against imports from China. Here’s what you need to know about them. Later in the day, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would likely meet Canada and Mexico “in the middle,” with an announcement coming as soon as Wednesday. Lutnick told Fox Business Network that the tariffs would not be paused, but that Trump would reach a compromise. “I think he’s going to figure out, you do more, and I’ll meet you in the middle in some way,” Lutnick said. A Canadian senior government official said Lutnick called Ontario Premier Doug Ford after Ford’s press conference and asked him to stand down. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call, said Ford told the U.S. commerce secretary he’ll go harder. The official said Lutnick told Ford that Trudeau’s “very dumb” comment and remarks by other Canadian officials were not helpful, but said Lutnick seemed to acknowledge the tariffs are a part of negotiation toward a trade deal.

(Adrian Wyld  Canadian Press via AP) A senior Canadian official said Trudeau told the premiers of Canada’s provinces that he hopes to speak to Trump on Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum saidMexico will respondto the new taxes with its own retaliatory tariffs. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday. The delay might indicate that Mexico still hopes to de-escalate Trump’s trade war. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s blistering rejection of the Trump tariffs. China indicated on Tuesday night that it would not back down. “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” China’s embassy to the United States posted on X. The president is abandoning the free trade policies the United States pursued for decades after World War II. He argues that open trade cost America millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to national prosperity. He rejects the views of mainstream economists who contend that such protectionism is costly and inefficient. Import taxes are “a very powerful weapon that politicians haven’t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,” Trump said Monday. “And now we’re using them.” Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin, author of a 2017 history of U.S. tariff policy, has calculated that Tuesday’s hikes will lift America’s average tariff from 2.4% to 10.5%, the highest level since the 1940s. “We’re in a new era for sure.” As the trade disputes escalated, stocksracked up more lossesTuesday on Wall Street, wiping out all the gains since Election Day for the S&P 500. Markets in Europe also fell sharply. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he will do next.

(Ethan Cairns  Canadian Press via AP) During his first term, Trumpimposed tariffsonly after lengthy investigations — into the national security implications of relying on foreign steel, for example, said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. But by declaring a national emergency involving the flow of immigrants and illicit drugs across U.S. borders, “he can modify these tariffs with a stroke of the pen,’’ House said. “It’s chaotic.” Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs. “Presidents don’t get to invent emergencies to justify bad policies,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Abusing emergency powers to wage an economic war on our closest allies isn’t leadership — it’s dangerous.” Even some Republican senators raised alarms. “Maine and Canada’s economy are integrated,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, explaining that much of the state’s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S. Truck driver Carlos Ponce, 58, went about business as usual Tuesday morning, transporting auto parts from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, just as he’s done for decades. Like many on the border, he was worried about the fallout from the tariffs. “Things could change drastically,” Ponce said. Truckers could lose their jobs or have to drive farther to coastal ports as Mexican manufacturers look for trading partners beyond the U.S. Alan Russell, head of Tecma, which helps factories set up in places like Ciudad Juarez, is skeptical that Trump’s tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the United States. “Nobody is going to move their factory until they have certainty,” Russell said. Just last week, he said, Tecma helped a North Carolina manufacturer that moved to Mexico because it couldn’t find enough workers in the United States.

(AP Photo Sancya, File) U.S. businesses near the Canadian border scrambled to deal with the impact. Gutherie Lumber in suburban Detroit reached out Tuesday to Canadian suppliers about the cost of 8-foot wood studs. About 15% of the lumber at the Gutherie yard in Livonia, Michigan, comes from Canada. Sales manager Mike Mahoney said Canadian suppliers are already raising prices. “They’re putting that 25% on studs.’’ Builders will strain to stay within their budgets. After years of effort and thousands of dollars in investment, Tom Bard, a Kentucky craft bourbon distiller, gained a foothold in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta and watched his sales grow north of the border. Now Kentucky bourbon is in Canada’s crosshairs, and an order from his Canadian distributors is on hold. “That hurts,” he said. At his small distillery “every single pallet that goes out the door makes a huge difference ... The last thing you want is to have an empty spot where your bottles are supposed to be on a shelf.” Bard co-owns the Bard Distillery with his wife, Kim, in western Kentucky’s Muhlenberg County, about 135 miles (217 kilometers) southwest of Louisville, Kentucky. Trump overwhelmingly carried Kentucky in the November election. In Muhlenberg County, Trump defeated Kamala Harris by a more than 3-to-1 margin. The China tariffs also threaten the U.S. toy industry. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be “crippling,” as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250304009100320?section=national/diplomacy,"SEJONG, March 4 (Yonhap) -- South Korea and the United States have agreed to launch working-level consultative bodies on promoting bilateral cooperation in shipbuilding and energy industries, as well as for discussions on Washington's new tariff scheme, Seoul's industry minister said Tuesday. South Korea is the first country to form working-level consultative bodies with the new U.S. administration on tariff negotiations and bilateral cooperation, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said in a press briefing on his recent visit to Washington, noting the channels will begin operation as soon as possible. The two sides plan to establish four different channels to discuss shipbuilding collaboration, energy cooperation, which includes South Korea's possible participation in the Alaska liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, tariffs and non-tariff barriers.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) The agreement was made during Ahn's three-day trip to Washington last week, where he met with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, as well as U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer and U.S. Secretary of Interior and National Energy Dominance Council Chairman Doug Burgum among others to discuss the Donald Trump administration's new tariff scheme. Ahn's trip came amid mounting concerns over the U.S. government's plan to impose 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, as well as to introduce reciprocal tariffs on trade partners while reviewing new tariffs on cars, chips and pharmaceuticals. ""Opening a negotiation channel with the U.S. was the priority of the trip as we are not playing a single-round match with the U.S. but rather a marathon,"" Ahn said. Ahn said he focused on emphasizing the fact that the South Korean economy has increasingly decoupled from China in recent years while sharply deepening industrial ties with the U.S. that included massive corporate investments in America. ""We told officials that South Korean companies' investments have only started, and there are many more to come, and for them to be carried out as planned, consistency in U.S. policies is needed,"" he said.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) The minister said he also conveyed South Korea's interest in participating in the gas pipeline development project in Alaska, one of the Trump administration's key agendas, as part of efforts to increase energy imports from the U.S. and thus reduce its trade surplus. Washington's trade officials also welcomed Ahn's proposal that Korean shipbuilders can manufacture warships, tankers and icebreakers for the U.S. on a preferential basis as part of measures to bolster bilateral cooperation in the shipbuilding industry, he added. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)",S.

https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/03/trump-zelenskyy-do-over-00209494,"President Donald Trump on Monday evening hit pause on all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, a show of force following last week’s dressing down of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office aimed at pressuring him back to the negotiating table. “President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace,” a White House official told POLITICO. “We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.” That directive came just hours after Trump told reporters that he’d yet to even discuss such a pause — and three days after the president’s remarkable berating of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Trump and Vice President JD Vance took issue with what they said was a lack of gratitude by Ukraine’s president who, as Trump put it to his face, doesn’t “have the cards” to prevail over Russia without continued assistance from the U.S. But Trump also made clear in public comments Monday that the economic agreement Zelenskyy had come to Washington to finalize remains on the table. The carrot and stick approach is about forcing Zelenskyy into a bigger negotiation to end the war with Russia. One administration official close to the process, granted anonymity to discuss internal matters, said that Trump and his senior team continue to believe that a relatively quick end to the war that Russia started three years ago remains possible and are eager to push Zelenskyy to tamp down his own rhetoric so they can draw both sides into negotiating. “There’s a potential window with Russia,” the official said. “You won’t get Putin to the table if you call him names.” But as much as Trump may want to broker a historic peace, his own ego remains a factor. On Monday, some aides continued to suggest that there would be no deal, no matter the high stakes, until Zelenskyy took ownership for Friday’s flap. “What we need to hear from President Zelenskyy is that he has regret for what happened, he’s ready to sign this minerals deal and that he’s ready to engage in peace talks,” said Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz during an appearance on Fox News Channel on Monday. Significant barriers remain to rescuing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. They include demands that Zelenskyy, though viewed as a victim by allies in Europe and many in the U.S., apologize to Trump. And it is becoming increasingly clear that even if Zelenskyy swallows his pride and apologizes to Trump for perceived insults, the profit-sharing deal on rare earth minerals is unlikely to lead immediately to peace talks or to deter Trump from drawing closer to Russia. Still, administration officials worked over the weekend to hold backchannel conversations to rescue the deal, while allies publicly urged Zelenskyy to make a public show of begging for forgiveness. And Trump, despite his strong anti-Zelenskyy rhetoric, left just enough daylight in his comments Monday to keep European and Ukrainian hopes alive. Pro-Ukraine lawmakers, increasingly swimming against a tide of Republican opposition to Zelenskyy and the war, are working to repair the situation. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a pro-Ukraine moderate, expressed confidence following a conversation with Zelenskyy’s chief of staff that the minerals pact would be worked out “in short order” and lead to longer-term economic and security agreements. “We are 100% getting this train back on the tracks,” Fitzpatrick wrote in a post on X. In his own remarks Monday afternoon, the president also struck a much more conciliatory posture than he conveyed Friday and even earlier Monday, when he blasted Zelenskyy on social media. During a back-and-forth with reporters in the Roosevelt Room, Trump talked up the benefits of a deal to split profits with Ukraine for the country’s rare earth minerals and tempered his attacks on Zelenskyy. “I just think he should be more appreciative because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin,” Trump said. Trump ducked a question about whether he’s discussed canceling additional defense aid for Ukraine, reiterated the security benefits for Kyiv of an American presence there and praised European leaders for expressing a willingness to increase defense spending. Just hours after attacking Zelenskyy over a comment suggesting the war’s end was “very, very far away,” Trump eased up, questioning whether the remark was accurate and not naming Zelenskyy as he urged him toward peace talks. But Trump is hardly in Zelenskyy’s or Europe’s camp. And his eagerness to build a relationship with Moscow is putting pressure on Europe. Asked whether talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin were in the offing, Trump said on Monday that “we’re going to do deals with everybody.” Lawmakers from both parties expressed concern about Trump’s move on Monday evening. “Too bad Iran, North Korea and China are not pausing their military aid and economic support,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told POLITICO. “There is an invader and a victim, there is a democracy and a dictatorship, there is a country who wants to be part of the West and one who hates the West. We should be unambiguously for the good side.” Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters that Trump’s decision comes at a critical time for Ukraine on the battlefield. “I do not think we should be pausing our efforts,” she said. “It’s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood.” The looming prospect of Trump’s reconciliation with Putin is giving greater urgency to European efforts to draft their own plan to take a bigger role in protecting Ukraine if and when it reaches a deal to end the war. “Europe has a short amount of time to go all in and ensure a full rapprochement between the Americans and the Russians doesn’t happen,” said Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer in his Monday morning email to clients. “Otherwise, they are left without a realistic strategic option.” Bremmer also said there was chatter that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, both of whom came to Washington last week, might return in hopes of repairing ties, resurrecting the minerals deal and promoting a European cease-fire plan. But Trump’s interest in normalizing relations with Moscow could cloud these plans and prompt him to make more demands of Zelenskyy, whose country has been under attack from Russia for three years. Earlier Monday, Trump blasted Zelenskyy on social media, attacking his comments about the prospect of a longer war as “the worst statement that could have been made.” “This guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing,” Trump wrote. They were among many comments that echoed the Kremlin, so much so that Dmitiri Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, crowed in an interview with state television Sunday that America’s foreign policy “largely aligns with our vision.” Like Trump, he blamed Ukraine for dragging out the war that Russia launched without provocation three years ago. “The Kyiv regime and Zelenskyy do not want peace,” Peskov said. Zelenskyy sought to smooth that tension with his own social media post — aimed at Trump — emphasizing his desire for peace “as soon as possible.” Europe’s show of support for Zelenskyy this weekend and discussions of separate peace proposals made clear that he is not alone and may have sufficient backing to fend off Russian attacks for some time. But Trump and Vice President JD Vance’s berating of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday has riled the president’s political base, which could complicate any rapprochement with Ukraine’s president. The president’s political allies have celebrated his humiliation of Zelenskyy as in keeping with his “America First” mantra. And some have leaned in even harder, urging the president to abandon Ukraine and European allies altogether. Elon Musk, the tech billionaire Trump has empowered to slash the federal bureaucracy, called for the U.S. to withdraw completely from NATO, the alliance of 32 nations formed in the aftermath of World War II in a post on X, his social media company. And MAGA-oriented members of Congress, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rep. Ana Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), issued similar statements. But continuing to play to his own base could cost Trump the historic peacemaking opportunity he says he seeks. “Trump is driving Ukraine toward Europe. And it will take everything Europe’s got to keep them going,” said Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama. “But when you refuse to give them any security guarantees, when you insult them, you’re actually giving away your leverage. Because, like it or not, Ukraine is going to have a say in any peace deal.” Meredith Lee Hill, Nahal Toosi, Robbie Gramer and Dasha Burns contributed to this report.",Trump halts military aid to Ukraine,Eli Stokols,Politico,2025-03-03T19:17:24,2025-03-03T19:58:15,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250303-sudan-reels-as-us-suspends-aid-amid-ongoing-war,"Sudan has been hit hard by the United States' decision to suspend development aid to the poorest countries. The country has been plunged into a destructive war since April 2023. Despite this, the Trump administration intends to end the budget of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which it has currently suspended for 90 days. A critical freeze for this country.Â
The impact of the recent US decision to suspend humanitarian and development aid to the poorest countries is already being felt in Sudan. Many NGOs have expressed their opposition and concern over the US decision. According to the UN, thirty million people, more than half of the Sudanese population, are suffering from hunger and need emergency assistance. Global aid in chaos as Trump proposes to slash funds and dismantle USAID Community kitchens, launched by volunteers among the inhabitants, at the beginning of the war in 2023, are feeling a heavy impact. These kitchens initially relied on donations from the local society and the diaspora until they were able to benefit from aid allocated by international agencies that struggle to reach conflict zones. Their goal is to help those displaced by the war, in extreme need. With the cuts, they are facing major difficulties. The volunteers report the closure of a thousand of these kitchens. Therefore, two million people in an absolute food emergency, who benefited from this aid, no longer have access to it. According to some estimates from local workers gathered by RFI, American aid financed between 70 and 80 percent of the sum needed to operate these kitchens, but today the usual channels for receiving cash are no longer available. Now, some volunteers told RFI they buy products on credit from fishermen and producers in order to keep their kitchens running at a minimum. With no assurance of ever being able to repay the money borrowed. Over half the population faces high levels of acute food insecurity in Sudan, according to the UN. Famine conditions have been confirmed in five locations in North Darfur and the eastern Nuba mountains, and expected to spread to five more areas by May of this year. ""Conditions for millions of civilians in North Darfur have become catastrophic, and now humanitarians in Sudan are grappling with the abrupt cut in US funds which have crippled numerous life-saving aid operations"", according

https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/03/iran-confirms-its-nuclear-programme-was-discussed-between-us-and-russia,"Iran’s foreign ministry confirmed the country’s nuclear issue has been discussed by the US and Russia but said nothing will happen without Iranian involvement. 

""(Iran's nuclear issue) has been discussed (between Russia and the US) as an international issue, but what matters is that whatever is to be done about Iran's nuclear issue will definitely not be done without Iran's opinion,"" said the ministry’s spokesman Esmail Baghaei. “Our Russian friends are fully aware of that,” he said at a briefing on Monday. US and Russian officials hadbilateral talks in Februaryin their most extensive high-level engagement since Moscow launched it’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. After the meeting of the representatives from Moscow and Washington, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov visited Iran – sparking speculation that he briefed officials in Tehran about the talks with the US. Baghaei’s comments come on the same day that a former Iranian foreign minister key to the country's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers reportedly resigned from the government of reformist Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. That deal was an agreement to limit the Iranian nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief and other provisions. The resignation of Mohammad Javad Zarif signalled Tehran’s rapid retreat from its outreach to the West as US President Donald Trump intensifies sanctions on the country. The news comes after Iran’s parliament on Sundayimpeached Finance Minister Abdolnasser Hemmati, who once ran for the presidency signalling he’d be willing to talk to the US president directly. While lawmakers focused their criticism of Hemmati over Iran’s plummeting currency, his removal underscored the danger faced by Pezeshkian – who won the presidential election last year promising to reach out to the West to get sanctions lifted. Iran has accelerated its production of nearweapons-grade uranium, according to a report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog seen by The Associated Press. Iran says its programme is peaceful, but the US says Tehran has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.” Israel and the US have said they won’t allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons, threatening the possibility of further escalation after Tehran twice attacked Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",Iran confirms its nuclear programme was discussed between US and Russia,David O'Sullivan,Euronews,2025-03-03T18:29:33,2025-03-03T18:29:33,gemini-2.0-flash

Gallant says at the ADL’s annual summit in New York City that he has spent hours with former Hamas hostages who told him that “the most important thing for them is to bring back their friends” still held captive. Resuming the war with Hamas before securing the release of the remaining hostages will mean “you won’t have hostages” left to save, says Gallant, who was defense minister at the time of the attack. “A bitter truth is even if we don’t want to fight Hamas we will fight them for a long period of time,” Gallant says. “First of all, bring the hostages, and then go and accomplish the job and Hamas will give us enough reason to do that.” Gallant advocates for a commission inquiry into Israel’s failings in preventing the Hamas onslaught. “The most important thing now is how to avoid any phenomena similar to what happened on October 7 in the future,” he says. “In order to do it, you have to learn the lessons and in order to learn the lessons you need to rebrief the Israeli actions.” “I think that our soldiers, our civilians, those who have been in the battlefield, those who were kidnapped and the wounded, people deserve all the answers and the answers have to be clear,” he says. “The only way is this committee that should be a national committee and I am the first one that is willing to step into the room and to give answers.”","In US, Gallant says Israel needs to prioritize hostages’ return over resumption of war",Luke Tress,The Times of Israel,2025-03-03T18:33:18,2025-03-03T20:09:50,gemini-2.0-flash

The Egyptian minister and his Jordanian counterpart, Ayman al-Safady, reiterated Monday both states' rejection to the displacement of Palestinians. They equally asserted the salience of concerting regional and international efforts to ensure the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, as a first step on the pathway of establishing a Palestinian state on the borders of June 4, 1967 having as capital Eastern Jerusalem.  
	 
The Egyptian minister met Sunday his Iraqi counterpart, Fouad Hussein, expressing support to Iraq's security and stability, and keenness on fully implementing bilateral projects, and trilateral projects with Jordan.
	 
The Egyptian and Iraqi ministers also conferred over the updates in Syria, so as Abdelatty underscored Egypt's support to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, launching an inclusive political process that would lead up to elections, and combating terrorism and extremism for Syria not to become a source of instability in the region.
	 
Minister Abdelatty met Monday his Yemeni counterpart, Shaea Mohsen al-Zandani, underlining Egypt's backing to the unity of Yemen, independence, territorial integrity and state institutions. The minister pointed out that Yemen's security and stability are essential to guarantee security in the Middle East and Red Sea.
	 
The Egyptian minister also expressed support to endeavors aimed at achieving a political solution to the rift in Yemen, as it will equally end the humanitarian suffering in the country. In a related context, Abdelatty shed light on the food and medical supplies Egypt has granted to Yemen, in addition to hosting large numbers of Yemenis providing them with basic services.
	 
The Egyptian minister met Palestinian Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohamed Mostafa to discuss hosting another conference - in partnership with the United Nations - on Gaza reconstruction. The two sides also exchanged views on updates in the enclave and ongoing Israeli violence in the West Bank.
	 
Minister Abdelatty stressed to his Tunisian counterpart, Mohamed Ali al-Nafty, the necessity of maintaining the regularity of holding meetings among joint specialized committees in order to preserve the recent growth of relations.
	 
Similarly, bilateral relations were the major topic in the meeting of the Egyptian minister and his Bahraini counterpart, Abdel Latif Bin Rashed al-Zayani, as the former stressed the importance of expanding cooperation in various fields, and coordination on regional issues.
	 
The meeting of Minister Abdelatty and his Mauritanian counterpart, Mohamed Salem Ould Merzoug, also focused on reinforcing collaboration in different sectors, so as the former expressed aspiration to convening a supreme joint committee to agree on certain plans, mainly concerning trade and economic aspects.

https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-starmer-trump-b025877c40ffe0ddf2a92adad1715231,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia “is still very, very far away,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, adding that he believed Ukraine’s long-term partnership with the U.S. was strong enough that American support would continue despite recent fraught relations with U.S. President Donald Trump. “I think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it’s more than an occasional relationship,” Zelenskyy said late Sunday, referring to Washington’s support for the past three years of war. “I believe that Ukraine has a strong enough partnership with the United States of America” to keep aid flowing, he said at a briefing in Ukrainian before leaving London. Zelenskyy publicly was upbeat despite the recent heated Oval Office blow up with Trump and Vice President JD Vance during which they accused him of being “disrespectful” and said he should show more gratitude for America’s help. The turn of events is unwelcome for Ukraine, whose understrength army is having a hard time keep bigger Russian forces at bay. The Ukrainian leader was in London to attend U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s effort to rally his European counterparts around continuing — and likely much increased — support for Ukraine from the continent amid political uncertainty in the U.S., and Trump’s overtures toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. Asked by a reporter to comment about the outlines of a new European initiative to end Russia’s war, Zelenskyy said: “We are talking about the first steps today, and therefore, until they are on paper, I would not like to talk about them in great detail.” “An agreement to end the war is still very, very far away, and no one has started all these steps yet. The peace that we foresee in the future must be just, honest, and most importantly, sustainable,” he added. Trump slammed Zelenskyy later Monday for suggesting that the end of Russia’s war against Ukraine is still far off. “This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. — Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia,” Trump added in his post. “What are they thinking?” The White House wants Zelenskyy to show more openness to potential concessions in order to bring the fighting to an end, but Zelenskyy resisted that idea while pressing for security guarantees from Washington during last Friday’s meeting. Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next leader after the recent election, said Monday that he didn’t think last Friday’s Oval Office blow-up was spontaneous. He said that he had watched the scene repeatedly. “My assessment is that it wasn’t a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but apparently an induced escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,” Merz said. He said that he was “somewhat astonished by the mutual tone,” but there has been “a certain continuity to what we are seeing from Washington at the moment” in recent weeks. “I would advocate for us preparing to have to do a great, great deal more for our own security in the coming years and decades,” he said. Even so, Merz said that he wanted to keep the trans-Atlantic relationship alive. “I would also advocate doing everything to keep the Americans in Europe,” he said. ___ Geir Moulson contributed to this report from Berlin. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at ","Ukraine's Zelenskyy says end of war with Russia is 'very, very far away'",Illia Novikov,AP News,2025-03-03T13:54:55,2025-03-03T14:08:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/man-stabbed-to-death-in-suspected-terror-attack-at-haifa-bus-terminal/,"An Israeli man was killed and at least four others were wounded in a terrorist attack at a major Haifa transit hub Monday, authorities said. The assailant, an Israeli Druze citizen, was shot and killed. His family said he suffered from mental illness. The knife attack at the northern city’s Lev Hamifratz bus station was the latest in a string of terror attacks targeting public transportation in Israel, after a ramming attack at a bus stop on Thursday and a series of botched bus bombings near Tel Aviv a week earlier. The attacker, identified by police as an Israeli citizen from the Druze community, was shot and killed by a bus station security guard and an armed passerby. Hebrew outlets named him as Jethro Shahin, a man in his 20s. Unconfirmed reports claimed he held German citizenship. Family members denied he had a terror motive and said he had suffered from mental illness. Reports said he was known to Israeli welfare services. The victim was identified in reports as Hassan Karim Dahamsheh, a 70-year-old resident of Kafr Kanna, an Arab town in the Galilee. According to police, the assailant stabbed Dahamsheh in the back several times, killing him. Four others were wounded, including a 15-year-old boy rushed to Haifa’s Rambam Medical Center with life-threatening injuries. The hospital said the teen was stable after undergoing emergency surgery. Three others, including a woman in her 70s and a man and woman in their 30s, were hospitalized with moderate wounds, health officials said. Graphic video of the attack captured by a surveillance camera showed the victim attempting to reach a security booth as the stabbing apparently began. The assailant then rushes the man, tackling him to the ground and repeatedly knifing him until a guard and another man shoot the attacker. Warning: Graphic footage An eyewitness told the Walla outlet that the stabber got off a bus from Shfar’am that pulled into the station, shouted “Allahu Akbar” and began stabbing those around him. Police said the assailant was a Druze citizen of Israel from Shfar’am, who returned to Israel a week ago after spending several months abroad. Israel Police chief Daniel Levy said forces were working to verify that the attacker had acted alone. Reports said that police raided the home of the suspected assailant and were questioning his family. He reportedly had no criminal record. Shfar’am Mayor Nahad Hazem told the Kan public broadcaster that two of those injured were from his city, one of them a relative of his own office director. “It is a heinous crime, and I completely condemn it,” Hazem said. MK Hamed Amar, a Druze lawmaker from the right-wing Yisrael Beytenu party said the attack did not represent the Druze community in Israel, which is largely integrated into society. He described the suspected assailant as a “terrorist with German citizenship who was born and lived in Germany.” “Such an act of terrorism is contrary to every moral and human value and certainly does not reflect the loyal spirit of the Druze community in Israel, which is a full partner in defending the state and its values,” said Amar, who hails from Shfaram. However, relatives denied Shahin was a terrorist, saying that he had struggled with mental illness. “I am a disabled IDF veteran and his other uncle is a reserve soldier. We have nothing in our family hostile to the state,” the attacker’s uncle Roni Kharis told the Ynet news site. The forum of the heads of the Druze and Circassian authorities put out a statement saying it “stands united and determined against any attempt to harm the security of Israeli citizens.” “We are certain that the identity of the attacker and his mental condition will soon become clear, and that the attacker is likely of German origin,” the statement read. Acting National Security Minister Haim Katz held a situation assessment after the attack, which occurred at a central transit hub for buses and trains linking northern Israel to Tel Aviv. “The days ahead are challenging,” Katz said in a statement. He said police and emergency services are on “high readiness” and urged the public to be alert for any potential dangers. The stabbing came after a car-ramming attack Thursday at a bus stop at Karkur Junction outside the city of Pardes Hanna that injured 13 people, including a teen hospitalized in critical condition.

https://apnews.com/article/china-congress-legislature-5cf899bfc9d4705135d9dd56c8dc5212,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s annual major political event gets underway this week, bringing together the nation’s top leaders and thousands of provincial leaders to endorse decisions already made by the all-powerful Chinese Communist Party. The meetings and gathering during the National People’s Congress, expected to last for about a week, are still important. The rubber-stamp parliament retains an important function: to signal the priorities of the government for the coming year and to disseminate instructions to party members and officials across the country. The messaging from leadership appears unchanged from previous years — stay the course on fostering innovation while also spurring domestic consumption. The question will be how they balance those two goals, and will it be enough to reinvigorate the economy? And to what extent will the government buffer the impact of what might be another phase in the U.S.-China trade war? This year also marks the end of China’s current 5-year plan, and experts will be looking for clues on the government’s priorities for the next, 2026 to 2030 plan. Here is what to watch for at this year’s event: What is China’s economic growth target? The National People’s Congress kicks off on Wednesday, with Premier Li Qiang, China’s top economic official, announcing the economic growth target for the year. Analysts expect it to come in at around 5% – holding the same target as the previous two years, and slightly lower than the 5.5% target in 2022. This would be no small feat considering China is still grappling with a sluggish real estate sector and lackluster consumer spending. Another uncertainty is trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump, who last month slapped a 10% tariff on Chinese imports while an additional 10% comes into effect on Tuesday. Forecasters at the International Monetary Fund are projecting a lower 4.6% growth rate this year. What are the government’s priorities? A commentary last Friday from the official Xinhua News Agency indicated that priority would be placed on boosting domestic demand and promoting innovation in science and technology. There’s also anticipation of more government support for the private sector to fuel growth. Chinese President Xi Jinping met in February with business leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, signaling support for the private sector at the highest level of leadership. A draft bill is also to be deliberated during the Congress over making a fairer and more equitable business environment for the private sector. China has already released a slew of measures to prop up the economy. Much of these have fallen short of hopes for a bigger stimulus, and analysts are tempering expectations on what to expect from the Congress. “I would not expect anything ... to come out that will really meaningfully shift that policy away from industrial policy and towards boosting consumption in meaningful, sufficient ways,” said Jacob Gunter, lead analyst for the economics research team at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. Instead, experts say leaders are staying the course on pushing for innovation that would boost China’s self-reliance. The purpose of the economy is no longer to improve household incomes and expand the middle class, Gunter said. “This is not a development-oriented economy,” he said. “It’s a geopolitically oriented economy, and technology and industry are way more important for that.” Where is China’s diplomacy headed? Li is expected to touch on foreign policy and Taiwan, but more attention will likely be on Foreign Minister Wang Yi. His annual news conference, to be held later in the week, will be closely watched to decipher China’s stance on U.S.-China relations under Trump. After the first 10% tariffs in February, China retaliated with a 15% tariff on American coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as 10% on crude oil, agriculture machinery and large-engine cars. “Beijing’s response to Trump’s initial 10% tariffs was measured — restrained enough to signal openness to negotiations yet firm enough to demonstrate its willingness to escalate if necessary,” Neil Thomas and Jing Qian wrote in a report for the Asia Society Policy Institute. They note that China’s president might use speeches in closed-door meetings during the Congress to send signals on bilateral relations, as he did two years ago when Xi named the United States as leading “containment encirclement and suppressions” against China. Also closely watched will be China’s relations with Russia and its position on the Ukraine war. At a recent Group of 20 foreign minister’s meeting in South Africa, Wang said a “window for peace is opening” in Ukraine, and that China supported “all efforts committed to peace, including the recent consensus reached by the United States and Russia.” What does the National People’s Congress do? The legislature is made up of nearly 3,000 delegates from China’s provinces, ministries, People’s Liberation Army, party organizations and various groups that represent workers and other interests. Their role is largely ceremonial in that the body does not have any real power to decide on legislation. Any vote is usually unanimous or near-unanimous to formalize decisions already taken by Communist Party leaders behind closed doors. Still, the Congress is a rare opportunity to see what the central government’s sees as priorities and goals, and the reports and speeches during it can give indications of the future direction of government policy. An advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, will meet at the same time. Members include business leaders, athletes, academics, religious leaders and representatives of ethnic groups. The concurrent meetings of the two bodies are known as the Two Sessions.",What to watch for at China’s National People's Congress this week,Emily Wang Fujiyama,AP News,2025-03-03T09:15:13,2025-03-03T20:56:43,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-britain-zelenskyy-europe-starmer-trump-russia-b980170ead74a1a7914c565f14ee6cc9,"LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rallied his European counterparts Sunday to shore up their borders and throw their full weight behind Ukraine as he announced outlines of a plan to end Russia’s war. “Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can, bringing different capabilities and support to the table, but all taking responsibility to act, all stepping up their own share of the burden,” he said. Starmer’s exhortation to 18 fellow leaders that they need to do the heavy lifting for their own security comes two days after U.S. backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy whenPresident Donald Trump lashed outat Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and saidhe wasn’t grateful enough for America’s support. The meeting had been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding that took place on live television at the White House. Starmer used the opportunity as part of his broader effort to bridge the gap between Europe and the U.S. and also salvage what had seemed like the start of a peace process before Friday’s spat. Starmer said he had worked with France and Ukraine on a plan to end the war and that the group of leaders — mostly from Europe — had agreed on four things. The steps toward peace would: keep aid flowing to Kyiv and maintain economic pressure on Russia to strengthen Ukraine’s hand; make sure Ukraine is at the bargaining table and any peace deal must ensure its sovereignty and security; and continue to arm Ukraine to deter future invasion. Finally, Starmer said they would develop a “coalition of the willing” to defend Ukraine and guarantee the peace. “Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can’t mean that we sit back,” he said. “Instead, those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency. The U.K. is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others.” It is far from certain whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will accept any such plan, which Starmer said would require strong U.S. backing. He did not specify what that meant, though he told the BBC before the summit that there were “intense discussions” to get a security guarantee from the U.S. “If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then Putin comes again,” Starmer said. Starmer said he will later bring a more formal plan to the U.S. and work with Trump. Before arriving in London, French president Emmanuel Macron suggested in an interview with a French newspaper that he and Starmer are proposing a “truce in the air, on the seas and energy infrastructures” that would last a month. There would be no European troops in the coming weeks and troops would only be deployed on the ground at a later stage, he said. The question, Macron said, is “how we use this time to try and get an accessible truce, with negotiations that will take several weeks and then, once peace is signed, a deployment.” Europe has been anxious since Trump initiated direct peace talks with Putin, who had been isolated by most Western leaders since invading Ukraine three years ago. Thescramble to remain relevantand protect European interests as their once stalwart ally appeared to be cozying up to Putin was even more troubling when Trumpcalled Zelenskyy a dictatorand falsely said Ukraine started the war. Meetings last week had provided some hope — until Zelenskyy’s trip to the White House on Friday. Visits to the Oval Office by Starmer and Macron, who had declared his visit a “turning point,” were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine, though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees and maintained that Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops. Within 12 hours of Starmer’s return from Washington, the talk of peace seemed to collapse as Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy for challenging Trump’s assertions that Putin could be trusted. During his Sunday press conference, Starmer rejected the suggestion that the U.S. was no longer a reliable ally. “There are no two countries as closely aligned as our two countries and our defense, our security and intelligence is intertwined in a way no two other countries are, so it’s an important and reliable ally for us,” he said. Starmer told the BBC before the summit that he does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin but does trust Trump. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said she was sorry for what happened with Zelenskyy in Washington. Meloni is both a strong Ukraine supporter and — as head of a far-right party — she is a natural ally of Trump. She was the only European leader to attend his inauguration. She said told reporters following the meeting that Europe must remain focused on its common goals and that “dividing the West would be disastrous for everyone.” “We need to work to reinforce our unity, and I think that Italy can play a role, not just in its own interest, but in everyone’s,” she said. “I don’t want to take any other scenario into consideration.” Starmer hosted the meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace, following his charm offensive with Macron to persuade Trump to put Ukraine at the center of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe. Leaders from Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania were at the summit. The Turkish foreign minister, the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council were also in attendance. Starmer used sweeping terms to describe the challenge ahead, saying Europe was at a crossroads in its history and needed to step up to meet “once in a generation moment.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen emerged from the meeting and said she would present a plan to “rearm Europe” to bolster the bloc’s security after a long period of underinvestment. As for the future of war-torn Ukraine, von der Leyen said it needs security guarantees. “We have to put Ukraine in a position of strength so that it has the means to fortify itself and to protect itself,” von der Leyen said. “It’s basically turning Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders.” Last week, Starmer pledged to boost military spendingto 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027. Other European nations may follow suit. Starmer pledged to supply more arms to defend Ukraine, announcing that the U.K. will use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export financing to supply 5,000 air defense missiles. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London, Colleen Barry in Milan, Karel Janicek in Prague and Samuel Petrequin contributed.",Starmer says Europe is at ‘crossroads in history’ as leaders agree to steps to Ukraine peace,"Brian Melley, Emma Burrows",AP News,2025-03-02T05:01:32,2025-03-03T03:51:33,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rferl.org/a/abkhazia-georgia-russia-gunba-presidential-election/33333928.html,"Kremlin-favored candidate Badra Gunba won the presidential runoff in Abkhazia, a Russian-backed breakaway region that legally is a part of Georgia, de facto election authorities said on March 2. Gunba, 47, failed to secure an outright majority in the first round on February 15, forcing the runoff against Adgur Ardzinba, a challenger critical of some Russian-backed economic policies. Authorities said Gunbawon almost 55 percent of the vote, while Ardzinba received 41.5 percent, and 2 percent voted against all, although there was no way to confirm the authenticity of the figures. Turnout was reported at 70 percent. In the first round, Gunba won 46.3 percent, while Ardzinba finished with 36.9 percent. Gunba, who previously served as vice president, took over as acting leader on November 19 after Aslan Bzhania resigned amid mass protests against an investment deal with Russia. Opponents feared the agreement threatened Abkhazia's already fragile status under Russian control. Ardzinba, a former de facto economy minister (2015â		20) and leader of the Abkhaz People's Movement, ran on a platform opposing the deal, though he still pledged close ties with Moscow. Russian pro-government media attempted to frame him as ""pro-Turkish."" The investment agreement aimed to strengthen economic ties between the breakaway region and Russia but was met with widespread opposition. Critics, including opposition figures and civil society groups, labeled the deal ""exploitative,"" claiming it would give undue advantages to Russian investors while undermining Abkhaziaâ		9s sovereignty. The deal was later rejected by the region's de facto legislature. Georgia's Foreign Ministry has denounced the ""so-called presidential elections in Russian-occupied Abkhazia,"" urging international condemnation of Moscow's ongoing violations. The EU reiterated its support for Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty in a statement following the first round, saying it does not recognize the constitutional and legal framework in which the ""so-called presidential elections in Abkhazia"" took place. ""The European Union recalls its firm support for the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders,""a statement said. TheGeorgian governmenton March 1 stated that the ""illegally"" held election ""contradicts fundamental principles of international law and represents another gross violation of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders."" Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke away from Georgia's rule after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. While Russia recognized Abkhazia's independence after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, most international community still views the region as part of Georgia. Though the territory is politically and economically dependent on Russia, some Abkhazians have been critical of what they see as Moscow's growing influence. Moscow welcomed Gunba's candidacy and his eventual victory. Just days before the first round, on February 7, Russia carried out a test flight from Moscow Vnukovo Airport to the long-defunct Sukhumi Babushara Airport, bringing Gunba amid passengers and pledging to establish regular air connections later this year. Gunba met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak. To bolster his position, Moscow announced the resumption of financial aid -- suspended since September -- and increased electricity supplies amid severe shortages. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Gunba following the election, according to the Kremlin press service.

https://www.politico.eu/article/china-could-blackmail-germany-via-wind-turbines-government-linked-report-warns/,"BRUSSELS — Germany’s political system and social cohesion are at stake unless it restricts Chinese wind turbines in the country, a government-backed analysis seen by POLITICO warns. The report, which the German defense ministry commissioned, argues Beijing could purposefully delay projects, harvest sensitive data and remotely shut down turbines if given access to wind farms. It also advises the country to stop an existing wind project using Chinese turbines from going ahead. “When using systems or components from Chinese manufacturers … given the political situation, it can even be assumed that such a slowdown or even disruption would be deliberately used by China as a means of political pressure or even as an instrument of economic warfare,” reads the report, prepared last month by the German Institute for Defense and Strategic Studies think tank.  “A destabilization of both the political system, the business model of German industry and social cohesion cannot therefore be ruled out due to a lack of or insufficient planning security in the energy sector,” it adds. The analysis comes amid growing concerns related to critical infrastructure risks in Europe. Since 2022, at least six separate incidents of suspected underwater sabotage have taken place in the Baltic Sea.  Meanwhile, Brussels has begun cracking down on Chinese wind suppliers after suspecting them of receiving state subsidies to beat out European competitors for European Union projects. Last year, the European Commission, the EU's executive, opened a probe into Beijing-linked wind projects in Bulgaria, France, Greece, Romania and Spain. Now those risks are likely to increase if ties worsen with Beijing, according to Andrea Scassola, vice president of wind research at the Rystad consultancy.  “What we are seeing … is intensifying great power rivalry, and at a time when our world is more interconnected than it has ever been — it’s a magnifier of vulnerability and risks,” he said. Overdependence on China also raises the risk of cyberattacks that could “lead to a shutdown of production,” Scassola said, adding that similar public warnings or legal moves to restrict Beijing’s access have already taken place in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Poland and Lithuania. The report makes similar warnings. If relations sour with China, Beijing could delay the operation of new farms by “at least four to five years” between the planning approval and commissioning stages, the analysis reads, and could coordinate other disruptive efforts with Russia.  Part of the danger also comes from the access that manufacturers get to turbines, according to the study. Beijing’s suppliers would have access to computer programs that control active turbines and collect data from hundreds of radars built into farms, it states — a significant issue given that wind produced a third of Germany’s electricity last year and a fifth of the EU’s power. In sum, the report argues, that would hand China “considerable blackmail potential in the future.” Germany’s defense ministry and the German Institute for Defense and Strategic Studies declined to comment on the report.  Public safety issue Despite the warnings, Germany has already begun eyeing Chinese firms as potential suppliers.  Last year, project developer Luxcara announced it had selected Beijing’s Ming Yang Smart Energy to supply 16 turbines for its “Waterkant” offshore wind farm in northwest Germany.  The report warns that the “first time use of Chinese wind turbines must be prevented” on “public safety” grounds, since it risks creating a reliance on Beijing’s expertise and giving it access to “essential elements of German critical infrastructure” near militarily relevant training areas. That’s not the first time the Chinese manufacturing giant’s overtures to Europe have come under scrutiny. Ming Yang supplied 10 turbines for an offshore wind farm in southern Italy that was completed in 2022; Britain’s investment minister also met with the company in December to discuss its business prospects in the U.K., POLITICO revealed last week. Germany’s wind industry is wary of the Waterkant project, too. Local turbine makers see projects with Beijing’s products as a “massive risk,” said Karina Würtz, managing director of the German Offshore Wind Energy Foundation, while acknowledging that projects like Waterkant face “threats to [their] commercial viability” if Chinese suppliers withdraw. Berlin must now “investigate into that risk, honestly and in-depth,” she said, and push ahead with enforcing EU laws like the 2023 NIS2 directive, which includes measures to mitigate cybersecurity threats, as soon as a new government is formed after the Feb. 23 election. The report, meanwhile, suggests that Berlin explore legal tools like its national procurement law and Wind Energy at Sea Act to exclude Chinese firms from contracts on defense or public safety grounds.  Ming Yang did not respond to questions sent by POLITICO. Luxcara declined to comment.","China could blackmail Germany via wind turbines, report warns",Victor Jack,POLITICO,2025-03-02T23:20:00,2025-03-02T23:21:44,gemini-2.0-flash

On the sidelines of the trilateral talks, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, are expected to hold a separate meeting. Seoul and Beijing have been discussing Wang's visit to South Korea on the occasion of his Tokyo trip, but it reportedly remains unclear whether he will visit South Korea. If no progress is made, Cho and Wang are likely to hold talks in the Japanese capital. The meeting, if held, would mark the first since September last year when they met on the sidelines of the U.N.

After Cho and his U.S. and Japanese counterparts expressed joint ""support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in appropriate international organizations"" in a joint statement last month, China lodged a complaint, calling it interference with its sovereignty. The meeting could also delve into the tariff increases by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, anti-Chinese sentiment among South Korea's conservative forces and a potential visit to South Korea's ancient city of Gyeongju by Chinese President Xi Jinping for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November. pbr@yna.co.kr(END)","FMs of S.

He said it was the work of a special task force created two days ago to tackle insecurity. Chérizier, aged 47, is the feared leader of Viv Ansam (Live Together), a coalition of gangs that control much of the city. It is not clear whether Kenyan police officers deployed in Haiti last year to help fight the gangs are involved in the security operation. Last week, a Kenyan police officer - who was on patrol with the Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support mission - was killed in a confrontation with gang members. Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-halts-aid-into-gaza-over-hamas-refusal-to-extend-first-phase-of-truce/,"ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 573 Israel said Sunday it would not allow any more goods to enter Gaza over what it called Hamas’s refusal to accept a proposal to extend the expiring initial stage of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, and threatened “additional consequences” and a return to war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government said the move had rock-solid backing from US President Donald Trump’s White House, even as Jerusalem appeared to back away from its previous agreement with Hamas to negotiate a second phase of the ceasefire during which additional hostages would be released and Israel would fully withdraw from Gaza. “With the end of phase one of the hostage deal and in light of Hamas’s refusal to accept the [US special envoy Steve] Witkoff outline for continuing talks – to which Israel agreed – Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement Sunday morning. “Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages,” the PMO added, threatening “further consequences” if Hamas continues to say no to the proposal. It later denied a report in Arabic-language media that Netanyahu had dispatched a delegation to Egypt for talks. Netanyahu also claimed at his weekly cabinet meeting that Hamas is diverting aid entering the Strip for its own use. “Hamas is currently taking control of all supplies and goods sent to the Gaza Strip. It is abusing the Gazan population who are trying to receive the aid, it is shooting at them, and is turning humanitarian aid into a terrorist budget directed against us,” he said. According to the Kan public broadcaster, Israel believes enough aid has entered the enclave in recent weeks to last Gaza for several months. Jerusalem has	questioned the veracity of reports of famine in the enclave over the course of the war, which has been blamed on a lack of sufficient aid flowing into the Strip via Israel-controlled border crossings. Both Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said Israel was prepared to negotiate the next phase of the ceasefire but was insisting on more hostages being freed during the talks. “The commitment to bringing in this amount [of supplies to Gaza] was in the first phase,” Sa’ar said at a press conference. “The first phase ended, and we are implementing the principle of no free meals.” Israel announced it was adopting a previously unpublicized “Witkoff plan” early Sunday as the first stage of the ceasefire deal expired and the sides failed to negotiate a second phase. According to Israel’s account of Witkoff’s proposal, the halt in fighting would extend until the end of Passover on April 19. Under the plan, half of the remaining hostages — living and dead — would be released on the first day of the extended ceasefire, and the remaining captives would be released at the end of the period if a permanent ceasefire is reached. Netanyahu denied that Israel was shirking its commitment to negotiate the second phase, saying Witkoff proposed the extension after he understood there was no way to bridge Israeli and Hamas positions on moving to the next stage. “He even defined his proposal as a corridor for negotiations on phase two,” said Netanyahu. “Israel is ready for this.” Hamas rejected the new proposal and lashed out against Israel for cutting off aid, calling it “cheap extortion, a war crime and a blatant attack on the [hostage-ceasefire] agreement.” The terror group urged mediators to compel Israel to reverse the decision. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters the decision to halt goods would impact the ceasefire talks, adding his group “doesn’t respond to pressures.” Both sides stopped short of saying the ceasefire had ended, though Palestinians reported several killed in an Israeli strike in Beit Hanoun Sunday morning. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed the strike, saying a drone was used to hit suspects spotted planting explosives near troops stationed in the Strip. In a Jerusalem press conference on Sunday, Sa’ar insisted the halt of aid was fully coordinated with the White House. “The Americans, of course, accept our position, and are familiar with it,” the foreign minister said alongside his Croatian counterpart. He said Israel had received a side letter from the Biden administration “that explicitly states that there is no automatic transition between phases.” “We fulfilled all our commitments [under Phase 1] until the very last day, which was yesterday,” he told a press conference. “Our position is that during negotiations, hostages should be released.” Phase one of the ceasefire with Hamas formally ended at midnight as Saturday became Sunday. Minutes later, following a four-hour security consultation with top officials, Netanyahu’s office declared that it was endorsing what he described as a US proposal, which would see the ceasefire with Hamas extended through Ramadan and Passover, during which all hostages could potentially be released. The Israeli statement claimed that Hamas has so far rejected the US plan, and implied that if this stance isn’t changed, Israel could resume the war that was sparked by the Palestinian terror group’s October 7, 2023, devastating onslaught in southern Israel and that has been on pause since January 19. There has been no official comment from the US administration on Israel’s announcement nor has it confirmed the Witkoff proposal. Talks on the second phase were meant to begin on Day 16 of the 42-day first phase that has now ended, but Israel has not engaged in indirect talks with Hamas on the topic. Beyond failing to engage in talks on the second phase, Israel has also not begun pulling back from the Philadelphi Corridor, which it is required to begin doing this week according to the agreement with Hamas. Netanyahu has indicated he is opposed to redeploying troops away from the belt of land on the Gaza-Egypt border that Israel says is used as a key smuggling route by Hamas to rearm and rebuild its forces. Terror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the Israel Defense Forces. Two of the 24 abductees presumed alive, as well as three of the dead captives, don’t hold Israeli citizenship. During the first phase, 33 Israeli hostages were released, eight of them dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including many convicted terrorists serving hefty jail sentences. Five Thai nationals held hostage in the Gaza Strip were freed during the same period under a separate arrangement. Under the ceasefire outline agreed to by Israel and Hamas on January 19, the remaining living hostages were to be released during the second stage of the deal, during which the IDF would complete a full withdrawal from Gaza. A third stage is also planned, during which the bodies of hostages held by Gazan terror groups would be released, the war would end, and the reconstruction of Gaza would begin. Senior Israeli officials, including Defense Minister Israel Katz, have said in recent days that the military was preparing for the option of the war resuming. Witkoff is expected to visit Israel soon, likely this coming week. The Ynet news site reported early Sunday, without citing sources, that Jerusalem would likely hold off on renewing the fighting until the visit. A trip to the region planned for last week was called off due to a lack of progress in the talks. An Israeli official told The Times of Israel that Witkoff would not travel to the region until late in the week at the earliest, as he plans to remain in the United States for Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday.","Israel halts aid into Gaza, citing Hamas refusal to extend first phase of truce","Lazar Berman, ToI Staff, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-03-02T11:58:51,2025-03-02T11:58:51,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-02-2025-99402570996dcf33239d0492d99909e4,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced sharp criticism as it stopped the entry of all food and other supplies into Gaza on Sunday and warned of “additional consequences” for Hamas if a fragile ceasefire isn’t extended. Mediators Egypt and Qatar accused Israel of violating humanitarian law by using starvation as a weapon. The ceasefire’s first phase saw a surge in humanitarian aid after months ofgrowing hunger. Hamas accused Israel of trying to derailthe next phaseSunday hours after its first phase had ended and called Israel’s decision to cut off aid “a war crime and a blatant attack” on a truce that took a year of negotiations before taking hold in January. In the second phase, Hamas would release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire. Negotiations on the second phase were meant to start a month ago but haven’t begun. Israel said Sunday that a new U.S. proposal calls for extending the ceasefire through Ramadan —the Muslim holy monththat began over the weekend — andthe Jewish Passover holiday, which ends April 20. Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid. The militants currently hold 59 hostages, 35 of them believed to be dead. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the United States would support whatever decision Israel makes, without commenting on the new proposal. Netanyahu said Israel is fully coordinated with the Trump administration and the ceasefire will only continue as long as Hamas keeps releasing hostages. Saying the ceasefire has saved countless lives, the International Committee of the Red Cross said that “any unraveling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair.” U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher called Israel’s decision “alarming,” noting that international humanitarian law makes clear that aid access must be allowed. U.N. Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres urged all parties to make every effort to prevent a return to hostilities in Gaza, and called for humanitarian aid to flow back into Gaza immediately and for the release of all hostages, said spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric. Five non-governmental groups asked Israel’s Supreme Court for an interim order barring the state from preventing aid from entering Gaza, claiming the move violates Israel’s obligations under international law: “These obligations cannot be condition on political considerations.” The war has left most of Gaza’s population of over 2 million dependent on international aid. About 600 aid trucks had entered daily since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, easing fears of famine raised by international experts. But residents said prices shot up as word of the closure spread. Fromthe heavily destroyedJabaliya urban refugee camp, Fayza Nassar said the closure would worsen dire conditions. “There will be famine and chaos,” she said. Hamas warned that any attempt to delay or cancel the ceasefire agreement would have “humanitarian consequences” for the hostages. The only way to free them is through the existing deal, the group said. Families of hostages again pressed Israel’s government. “Postponing the negotiation on the deal for everyone’s (release) can’t happen,” Lishay Miran-Lavi, wife of hostage Omri Miran, said in Tel Aviv. “Hostages don’t have time to wait for an ideal deal.” Israel imposed a siege on Gaza in the war’s opening days and only eased it under U.S. pressure. U.N. agencies and aid groups accused Israel ofnot facilitating enough aidduring 15 months of war. The International Criminal Court said there was reason to believe Israel had used “starvation as a method of warfare” when it issuedan arrest warrant for Netanyahulast year. The allegation is also central to South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justiceaccusing Israel of genocide. Israel has denied the accusations. It says it has allowed in enough aid and blamed shortages on what it called the U.N.’s inability to distribute it. It also accused Hamas of siphoning off aid — an allegation that Netanyahu repeated Sunday. Kenneth Roth, former head of Human Rights Watch, said Israel as an occupying power has an “absolute duty” to facilitate humanitarian aid under the Geneva Conventions, and called Israel’s decision “a resumption of the war-crime starvation strategy” that led to the ICC warrant. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. Israel’s offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It says more than half of those killed were women and children. It does not specify how many of the dead were combatants. Israeli bombardment pounded large areas of Gaza to rubble and displaced some 90% of the population. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 35 of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead, not 32. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-guyana-oil-exxonmobil-1142faf844adffab680b3b643bd27799,"GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali on Saturday denounced an incursion by an armed Venezuelan naval vessel in disputed waters that are home to a mammoth offshore oil deposit being developed by ExxonMobil. In a televised address, Ali said Guyana was hurriedly notifying all of its international allies, including the Trump administration, and had summoned Venezuela’s ambassador in the capital, Georgetown, to lodge a formal protest. “This incursion is a matter of grave concern,” he said. “Guyana’s maritime boundaries are recognized under international law. This is a serious development concerning our nation’s maritime territory. We will not tolerate threats to territorial integrity.” Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez disputed Ali’s claims and called ExxonMobil’s oil installations “illegal.” “He’s telling bald-faced lies,” she said in a statement, referring to Guyana’s president.  The Trump administration, which this week took swift action to tighten sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro ‘s government, echoed Ali’s concerns.  “Further provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime,” the U.S. State Department said on X.   Feud over land and maritime borders Ali said the Venezuelan vessel passed close to several huge vessels used to store oil being produced by three oilfields operated by Exxon and partners Hess Corp and CNOOC of China in the Stabroek Block containing an estimated 11 billion barrels of oil. He said several aircraft and marine vessels had been deployed to support the large number of drill ships, seismic vessels and support ships operating in the bloc. Saturday’s development came two weeks after armed men, suspected Venezuelan pirates operating in the border Cuyuni River, exchanged gunfire with a Guyanese military patrol, injuring six soldiers, two of them seriously.  Since ExxonMobil made its major oil discovery in Guyana in 2015, Venezuela has revived a century-old territorial dispute with Guyana and taken steps to annex the remote Essequibo region that comprises about two thirds of Guyana’s land mass. The two neighboring states have feuded over land and maritime borders for decades as Venezuela claims that an 1890s boundaries commission cheated it out of the oil rich region. The area was administered by Britain for more than a century, and it has been under Guyanese control since 1966, when the nation gained its independence from the United Kingdom.",Guyana's denounces Venezuelan naval incursion in oil field operated by ExxonMobil,,AP News,2025-03-01T12:52:59,2025-03-01T17:01:13,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-releases-video-of-hostage-pleading-to-be-freed-as-his-brother-is-separated-from-him/,"ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 573 Hamas published a propaganda video Saturday showing Iair Horn, 46, who was released from captivity two weeks ago, saying goodbye to his younger brother Eitan, 38, who is still being held in the Gaza Strip. After approving the publication of the video, the family of the captive demanded the government continue the hostage-ceasefire deal, the first phase of which is scheduled to end at midnight Saturday. Hamas hasrejectedan Israeli proposal to extend the first phase, insisting that the deal proceed to stage two, which Israel has largely refused to negotiate for the past month. The video begins with five hostages sitting on the floor â		 Sagui Dekel-Chen, and two more hostages whose faces Hamas blurred in the video â		 sitting in a room, preparing to eat. The father of hostage Nimrod Cohen later identified his son as one of the other hostages by the tattoo on his forearm. â		He got the tattoo a few days before he was kidnapped,â		 Yehuda Cohen told the Ynet news site. â		Iâ			Iâ			ms games.â		 The hostages embrace each other in the video ahead of the release of Iair and Dekel-Chen, which Eitan says in the video would be taking place the next day. Iair Horn, Dekel-Chen, and Sasha Troufanov werereleasedon February 15 as part of the first phase of the deal. The camera then pans to the face of a distraught Eitan, seemingly overwhelmed about being left behind. â		I am very happy that my brother will be released tomorrow, but it is not logical in any way that families are being separated,â		 Eitan says, his voice cracking. â		Get everyone out and stop [separating] families, and do not destroy our lives anymore,â		 he adds, before crying into the shoulder of his older brother Iair. â		Tell mom, dad and everyone to continue with the demonstrations [for a hostages deal], that they shouldnâ			should sign already onto the second and third phases of the deal to return all of us home,â		 Eitan tells his brother Iair. â		Do everything you can.â		 â		You are now forcing me to leave my little brother here to die,â		 Iair says into the camera, with his arm still around Eitanâ			 shoulder. Eitan expresses his disbelief and disgust that Israelâ			 government is not interested in moving forward with the dealâ			 second phase. â		Have you gone crazy?â		 he asks. â		My brother is leaving, and Iâ			 Eitan says that sometimes he receives food and sometimes he doesnâ			 sometimes heâ			 okay and sometimes heâ			 But here, Iâ			 okay,â		 he says, pointing to his head, apparently referring to the psychological effects of captivity. Eitan then addresses Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly and pleads with him to sign onto the second phase of the hostage deal. In their statement, the Horn family said, â		Our hearts break seeing Eitan in this difficult situation being separated from his brother to continue being held in Hamasâ			 hell for [what now is] 512 days.â		 â		You can see in Eitanâ			 eyes the despair and fear he is in. Since Iair returned to us, he has not stopped thinking and acting for Eitan and all hostages he met in captivity who remain in Gaza. â		We demand that the decision-makers look Eitan in the eye and continue the deal that has already returned dozens of hostages. They are running out of time! Bring everyone home â		 now â		 and in one fell swoop,â		 the family added. In a statement, the Prime Ministerâ			 Office called the video â		brutal propaganda.â		 â		The Hamas terrorist organization released another brutal propaganda video this evening, in which our hostages are forced to engage in psychological warfare,â		 the PMO said. Promising not to be deterred, Netanyahuâ			 office pledged to â		work tirelessly to return all of our hostages and meet all of Israelâ			 war goals.â		 Nimrod Cohenâ			 father Yehuda rejected Netanyahuâ			 branding of the video as â		psychological terrorâ		 and accused the premier of sacrificing the hostages in order to maintain his grip on power. Iair Horn was abducted from his home in Nir Oz on October 7 as Hamas terrorists swarmed through the kibbutz, killing or kidnapping a quarter of the southern communityâ			 residents. Israel says 251 people were kidnapped and some 1,200 killed during the massive Hamas-led onslaught across southern Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. His brother, Eitan, who was visiting from Kfar Saba for the holiday weekend, was also kidnapped and is still held in Gaza. He was not on the list of â		 cases â		 women, children, elderly individuals, and the infirm â		 slated for release in the first stage of the ceasefire. The first, 42-day phase of the agreement formally expires Saturday. Thirty-three Israeli hostages have been released â		 eight of them dead, along with five Thai nations. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners have been freed. Under the ceasefire outline, the remaining living hostages â		 believed to number 24 â		 are to be released during the second stage of the deal, during which the Israel Defense Forces would complete a full withdrawal from Gaza. A third stage is also planned, during which the bodies of hostages killed on October 7 or in captivity would be released, and the war would end permanently.

https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-london-bf158d8f9e10a7c049ea90f8fd917ab6,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the American people and leadership and voiced hope for “strong relations,” a day after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with U.S. President Donald Trump that left many uncertain where the once staunch allies stood. Zelenskyy on Saturday arrived in London ahead of a summit on Sunday organized by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer with other European leaders. The summit will also include leaders from France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Finland, Sweden, Czechia and Romania, as well as the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council. The meltdown that unfolded Friday in the final minutes of the highly anticipated meeting at the White House between Trump and Zelenskyy seemed to dash, at least for now, Ukrainian hopes that the United States could be locked in as a reliable partner in helping fend off, and conclude, Russia’s three-year onslaught. Here’s the latest: NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he had to “find a way to restore his relationship with the American president” after the two leaders engaged in an extraordinary meltdown at the White House on Friday. Rutte told the BBC on Saturday that he told Zelenskyy that “he really had to respect what President Trump has done so far for Ukraine.” He was referring to the first Trump administration’s decision in 2019 to supply Ukraine with Javelin antitank missiles that Ukraine used to deadly effect against Russian tanks in the first wave of the 2022 invasion. Calling the Friday meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy “unfortunate,” Rutte said he “knew as a fact that the American administration is extremely invested in making sure that Ukraine gets to a durable peace” with Russia. Rutte said he expected European leaders, who were meeting in London on Sunday, to help secure a future peace deal by providing Ukraine with security guarantees. Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski says she is “sick to her stomach” that the Trump administration “appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin.” Murkowski, a longtime senator from Alaska with an independent steak, has been one of the few Republicans in Congress willing to publicly break with Trump. Her statement Saturday was a lonely voice of support among Republicans in Washington. Even Republicans sympathetic to Ukraine, including Sen. Lindsey Graham and House Speaker Mike Johnson, have been critical of Zelenskyy following Friday’s contentious White House meeting. “This week started with administration officials refusing to acknowledge that Russia started the war in Ukraine,” Murkowski wrote on X. “It ends with a tense, regrettable conversation in the Oval Office and whispers from the White House that they may try to end all U.S. support for Ukraine.” French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with President Donald Trump and his Ukraine counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy after their stunning spat in the Oval Office on live television, the French presidency said. Macron had calls with Trump and Zelenskyy ahead of Sunday’s summit in London to discuss Ukraine. He also spoke with British Prime minister Keir Starmer, EU Council president Antonio Costa and NATO secretary general Mark Rutte, the Elysee Palace said. The phone calls were also aimed at preparing a summit of EU leaders next week in Brussels that will also focus on the future of Ukraine. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer embraced President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday and told him he had the nation’s unwavering support a day after the blowout at the White House with President Donald Trump. The Ukraine leader arrived in London to shouts of support from people who had gathered outside Starmer’s official residence where he was hugged by the British prime minister. “And as you heard from the cheers on the street outside, you have full backing across the United Kingdom,” Starmer told him. “We stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take.” Zelenskyy, who thanked Starmer and the people of the U.K. for their support and friendship, will meet with King Charles III on Sunday before attending the summit with European leaders. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says the European Union should follow “the example of the United States” and start “direct discussions with Russia on a ceasefire and sustainable peace in Ukraine.” Orban, considered the Kremlin’s closest partner among EU leaders, said in a letter to the president of the European Council that “this approach is not reconcilable” with the draft conclusions for an upcoming summit of EU leaders next week in Brussels. The draft conclusions state that there can be no negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine, and that a ceasefire can only take place as part of a comprehensive peace agreement. The letter from Orban was leaked Saturday and its authenticity was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person with knowledge of the document. The person requested to remain anonymous because the letter was not public. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala says “Europe faces a historic test” and has to be able to take care of itself. “Nobody else will do it.” Vice President JD Vance, right, speaks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, as President Donald Trump listens in the Oval Office at the White House, Friday, Feb. 28, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/ Mystyslav Chernov) Fila said Saturday that Europe has to increase its military support for Ukraine and European countries have to increase their arms spending to reach “at least” 3% of GDP. “If we don’t increase our effort fast enough and let the aggressor dictate its conditions, we won’t end up well,” he said. Slovak populist Prime Minister Robert Fico repeated his country won’t provide Ukraine any military or financial support that would help it fight Russia. Fico also demanded that an emergency EU summit in Brussels on Thursday agree to a call for an immediate ceasefire, “which is something that President Zelenskyy and a majority of EU member states refuse to do.” Fico said his country also wants the summit to specifically request Ukraine to reopen the transit of Russian gas to Europe. He warned that if the summit doesn’t respect the Slovak requests, “the European Council might not be able to agree on its position regarding Ukraine on Thursday.” President Donald Trump’s national security adviser says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “has not gotten the memo that this is a new sheriff in town.” Mike Waltz said Saturday on Fox News that the Ukrainian leader heard from former President Joe Biden, “as long as it takes, as much as it takes, blank check.” Waltz spoke a day after a White House blowout between Trump and Zelenskyy derailed plans to sign an economic agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine. He rejected suggestions among some Trump critics that the president and Vice President JD Vance “ambushed” Zelenskyy. “That is absolutely and categorically false,” Waltz said. Russian forces have captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed Saturday, as they continue a monthslong grinding offensive in what was once the country’s industrial heartland. If confirmed, the capture of Burlatske and Skudne would mark a further push northwest by Russia in the eastern Donetsk region. Ukraine did not immediately comment.

(AP Photo Klochko) An open-source Ukrainian map widely used by the military and analysts showed the pace of Russian advances appeared to be slowing for a third consecutive month. The team behind the map, Deepstate, attributed this slowdown to heavy casualties. But Russian troops continued to inch forward, in what appears to be a long-term bid by the Kremlin to wear down Ukraine’s defenses. Poland’s President Andrzej Duda has called on Zelenskyy to return to the negotiating table in order to ensure the security of his country, arguing that only the United States is able to stop Russian aggression. Duda is a strong supporter of Ukraine and has friendly ties with Trump. “Volodymyr Zelenskyy should return to this table, sit calmly at this table, remain calm, negotiate a solution that will make Ukraine safe,” Duda told reporters in Poland. He said that he sees no other force than the United States that could stop Russian aggression. Russia said on Saturday that it shot down three Ukrainian drones that targeted part of the infrastructure of the TurkStream gas pipeline, which transports Russian gas across the Black Sea to Turkey and Europe. The Russian defense ministry said the drones aimed to strike a compressor station in Russia’s southern Krasnodar region, in the latest of a series of similar attacks this year. Its claims could not be independently confirmed, and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Before its troops moved into Ukraine, Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union’s pipeline natural gas. Most of these flows have since halted, with exports from Norway and the U.S. filling the gap. The TurkStream pipeline continues to send gas to EU member Hungary, as well as Turkey and Serbia. The French minister of the armed forces says France’s nuclear deterrent will remain the prerogative of the country’s president as European leaders mull ways to bolster their security amid uncertainty over U.S. support. Sebastien Lecornu posted a clarification on the social network X on Saturday after French president Emmanuel Macron said he was ready to open discussions on a possible European nuclear deterrent. “Our nuclear deterrent is French, and it will remain so: from the design and production of our weapons, to their deployment on the decision of the President of the Republic,” Lecornu said. “It protects France’s vital interests, which the head of state alone is responsible for defining.” Future German leader Friedrich Merz has suggested that Britain and France could “share” their nuclear weapons in the future. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said “a new era of ruthlessness” had begun in the wake of Trump’s treatment of Zelenskyy at the White House, but vowed that it would only increase her country’s commitment to Ukraine. “Many of you will have slept fitfully tonight in the face of the unspeakable videos from the White House. Frankly, so did I. Unfortunately, this was not a bad dream, but a violent reality,” she told reporters on Saturday. “Our horror is greater today than before, but so is our commitment to the people of Ukraine, to our own security and to peace in Europe.” She described Ukraine as “part of free and democratic Europe” and said there is no question as to who is the aggressor and who is “the brave defender” in the war. A nighttime Russian drone strike on Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv wounded 12 civilians, including two children, the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine reported on Saturday. According to Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov, some of the drones hit a medical facility where inpatients were staying overnight, while others damaged residential buildings.

(AP Photo Marienko) A man walks inside a hospital damaged by a Russian strike, in Kharkiv, Ukraine, March 1, 2025. (AP Photo Marienko) Ukraine’s air force said Russia overnight launched a total of 154 attack drones at Ukrainian territory, 103 of which were shot down. Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson described Friday’s Oval Office blowout between Trump and Zelenskyy as a “complete political and diplomatic failure” for Kyiv. In a statement Saturday, Maria Zakharova also slammed the “political weakness and extreme moral degradation” of European leaders who continue to support Ukraine and its president. Zakharova said Russia’s war aims remain unchanged, implying Moscow will insist on a demilitarized Ukraine barred from NATO, and on annexing Ukrainian territories it controls. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier criticized Trump in unusually sharp terms for his behavior during the meeting with Zelenskyy at the Oval Office. “Diplomacy fails when negotiating partners are humiliated in front of the whole world,” Steinmeier told dpa, the German news agency, during a flight to Uruguay. “The scene in the White House yesterday took my breath away. I would never have believed that we would one day have to protect Ukraine from the USA.” French President Emmanuel Macron said if someone is gambling with World War III, it is not Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyybut more likely his Russian counterpart. Macron reacted to Friday’s heated exchange between U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpand Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, during which Trump accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with World War III.” “If anyone is gambling with World War III, his name is Vladimir Putin,” Macron told Portugal’s RTP news channel during a visit to Lisbon ahead of Sunday’s Ukraine summit of European leaders in London. Macron said he still hopes that the United States will remain committed to the defense of democracy. “My hope is that the United States of America will continue to stand by its history and its principles,” he said. “Whenever we have had major conflicts, the United States of America has been on the right side of history and freedom.” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Saturday spoke to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov about the war in Ukraine, officials said. The phone call came a day before Fidan is due to attend a London summit of European leaders to discuss bringing the three-year conflict to an end. Turkey, which has close ties to both Ukraine and Russia, has previously offered to mediate talks. It hosted unsuccessful peace talks in 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy voiced thanks to the “American people” and leadership, and hope for “strong relations,” less than a day after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with Trump that left many uncertain where the once staunch allies stood. Ukraine had walked into the meeting prepared to sign a mineral deal with the U.S., hoping it would be a step toward a just ceasefire, but left empty handed. Soon after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy left the White House on Friday after an astonishing Oval Office row with US President Donald Trump, Ukrainians rallied around Zelenskyy as a defender of his country’s interests. (AP video by Alex Babenko and produced by Dmytro Zhyhinas) In a series of posts on X on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukrainians are “very grateful to the United States for all the support,” and specifically thanked Trump and Congress alongside the “American people.” “Our relationship with the American President is more than just two leaders: It’s a historic and solid bond between our peoples. … American people helped save our people,” he said. “We want only strong relations with America and I really hope we will have them,” he added. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to meet Saturday afternoon with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the dramatic blowout withPresident Donald Trumpat the White House. Zelenskyy’s plane with the Ukrainian flag on its tail landed at London Stansted Airport the morning after the diplomatic spat on live TV. Zelenskyy had been due to meet with Starmer on Sunday, hours before taking part in a London summit of European leaders to discuss how to ensure a peaceful end to the war and provide security across the continent. But the timetable for their bilateral meeting was apparently sped up in the aftermath of the Washington visit.",The Latest: Most European leaders back Zelenskyy as he joins crisis talks in London,The Associated Press,AP News,2025-03-01T12:23:36,2025-03-01T17:57:09,gemini-2.0-flash

Starmer started off his Sunday by telling the BBC that the UK and France will work with Ukraine ""on a plan to stop the fighting"" with Russia - and will then ""discuss that plan with the United States"". After a swift stop at No10 tomeet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, he headed to Lancaster House to greet the 18 leaders â	“ mostly from Europe, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky â	“ for his Ukraine summit. A little over two hours later, Starmer was back in Downing Street warning that â	“we are at a crossroads in history todayâ	”. He said the UK would be allowing Ukraine access to Â£1.6bn of export finance to buy an additional 5,000 air defence missiles â	“ and the leaders had reached an understanding on four crucial steps needed to secure peace in Ukraine. As Starmer spoke, Zelensky flew to Sandringhamfor a meeting with King Charlesbefore a 90-minute chat with reporters ahead of his trip back to Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said he still wants ""the Ukrainian position to be heard"" while adding his country is stillprepared to go ahead with a rare minerals deal with the USdespite his heated confrontation with Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday. ""If we agreed to sign the minerals deal, weâ	’re ready to sign it,"" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. He also suggested that he's aware of a reported joint proposal by Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macronfor a one-month truce with Russia. ""I'm aware of everything,""he said in reply. We'll be pausing our coverage of the latest efforts to secure a diplomatic conclusion to the war in Ukraine. Thank you so much for sticking with us today - have a great evening. And here's our mini-photo gallery reflecting the highlights of what has proved to be a very busy news day in London. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer (front row, centre) hosted a crisis summit with key international leaders at London's Lancaster House to discuss urgent measures to help achieve a just peace in Ukraine, following a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (front row, second right) and his US counterpart Donald Trump Zelensky (second right) got a warm reception at the gathering - in what is seen as a public show of support for the leader of a war-torn country still struggling to repel a full-scale invasion Russia launched more than three years ago After the summit, Keir Starmer unveiled a four-step plan to guarantee peace in Ukraine, including the continuation of military aid to Kyiv and more economic pressure on Russia Later in the day, President Zelensky (right) met King Charles at his residence in Sandringham, Norfolk To cap the very busy day, Zelensky held a media briefing, telling the BBC that Ukraine remained ready to sign a major minerals deal with the US During his sit-down with the press earlier this evening, Zelensky was asked about accepting the current line of contact as Ukraine's de-facto new border. ""Today we are talking about the first steps,"" Zelensky says about today's meeting with fellow leaders, saying he doesn't want to talk about them until they are down on paper. He goes on to say that they are not talking about concessions of any kind before saying everyone needs to recognise that Ukraine will never recognise territories currently occupied by Russia as Russian land. Zelensky ends his answer by adding that Ukraine hopes that security guarantees will make it â	“100% impossibleâ	” for Russia to pursue further aggression - but saying he doesnâ	’t want to talk about the details until there are signatures on paper from Ukraineâ	’s partners. More now from French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmerand their reported proposed one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine. In an interview with France's Le Figaro newspaper, Macron says such a truce would not - initially, at least - cover ground fighting but would be ""in the air, at sea"". But he admits it would be very difficult to verify that the ceasefire was actually being respected on such a vast front line. Peacekeepers could be deployed at a later date, the French leader also suggests before adding: ""There won't be European troops on Ukrainian soil in the coming weeks."" He also suggests European countries should raise their defence spending to between 3 and 3.5 % of GDP to respond to Washington's shifting priorities and Russia's militarisation. We can bring you some more comments from Volodymyr Zelensky from his final media appearance before heading back to Ukraine. Asked for his thoughts on todayâ	’s summit and his security guarantees goals, he says Ukraine believes its best security guarantee â	“is a strong Ukrainian armyâ	” - something he says he's sure Sir Keir Starmer knows too. He says it's ""important"" European allies are not reconsidering Russia's role as the aggressor party, adding he's raised the issue of using frozen Russian assets to help with the reconstruction of his country again. Ukraineâ	’s relationship with the US will continue, Zelensky says, later adding that he doesn't think that Friday's scenes inside the Oval Office ""brought something positive or additional to us as partners"". He adds that he's ""sure that this situation will pass by"" and that in the future, if talks are ""constructive, a positive result will come"". James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent In recent weeks, diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in Ukraine have been led by Donald Trump, speaking to President Putin and, well, at President Zelensky. All the while, his administration has gone after its European allies; questioning their democracy, voting against them at the United Nations and today â	“ in the form of the presidentâ	’s chief enforcer, Elon Musk â	“ saying even the US should leave the Nato military alliance. This has left the transatlantic alliance on the brink. So todayâ	’s summit was an attempt by the prime minister both to calm diplomatic brows and stiffen diplomatic sinews. His plan, along with the French, is to explorea new way of finding a ceasefire in Ukraineand in so doing take some ownership of the process. Diplomats said there was clear resolve to support Ukraine but also to build on Trumpâ	’s desire to find a ceasefire. That included more countries offering Ukraine greater security guarantees to deter Russian aggression, turning the country into what the European Commission chiefUrsula von der Leyen described a steel porcupine. But Europe stepping up is only half of the story. The prime minister made clear the US has to be willing to play its part. And today there were mixed messages. The secretary of state Marco Rubio said America was ready to engage with Ukraine. But the US national security adviser Mike Waltz suggested Zelensky might have to resign as part of any ceasefire. We've reported a little earlier that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned a deal on minerals between the US and Ukrainecould not be signed ""without a peace deal"" with Russia. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg has quizzed Zelensky about the future of the agreement - noting the White House is now â	“making clear you need to budge somehowâ	”. Zelensky answers saying the minerals deal is ready for minister to sign. â	“It is our policy to continue what happened in the past, weâ	’re constructive,â	” he continues, â	“if we agreed to sign the minerals deal, weâ	’re ready to sign it.â	” â	“The agreement thatâ	’s on the table will be signed if the parties are ready,â	” he concludes. Kuenssberg also asks the Ukrainian president about comments from French President Emmanuel Macron about a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine. French national newspaper Le Figaro reports Macron said he and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have proposed the temporary cessation of the conflict ""in the air, at sea"". Asked whether he's aware of the plan, Zelensky says: ""I'm aware of everything."" This video can not be played Are you aware of truce reports, Zelensky? - asks Kuenssberg We can now bring you fresh remarks from Volodymyr Zelensky, who's sat down with members of the media before heading back to Ukraine. Are you willing in principle, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks, to talk about conceding territory as well as in principle expressing some regret to President Trump after your heated confrontation at the White House on Friday? While he doesn't directly address the question, he says: â	“I just want the Ukrainian position to be heard,â	” adding that he didnâ	’t want his countryâ	’s position to be ambiguous. But he says â	“we must all understand and know each other, and we must understand the red lines,â	” saying those red lines are not emotional, but they just happen to be there. We can now bring you Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's reaction to his meeting with fellow leaders in London earlier today. ""We feel strong support for Ukraine, our people: soldiers and civilians, our independence,"" he writes on Telegram. ""We are working together in Europe to create a solid foundation for cooperation with America for the sake of real peace and guaranteed security."" ""European unity is at an exceptionally high level, which has not been seen for a long time,"" he adds. A little earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was asked if aminerals deal between Ukraine and the USis still on the table. He tells the BBC's US partner CBS it's ""impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal"". Bessent says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ""thrown off the sequencing"" of how the minerals deal and peace deal were supposed to play out, and that it's unclear if he now wants to proceed. ""President Trump's idea for this economic arrangement was to further intertwine American and Ukrainian people and to show the Russian leadership that there was no daylight,"" says Bessent. He adds that Zelensky came to the Oval Office and ""tried to relitigate in front of the world"". ""The place to have done that would have been in the private lunch,"" he says. John CampbellBBC News NI economics and business editor During his speech, the prime minister said5,000 air defence missiles will be supplied to Ukraine. They will be manufactured in Belfast at a factory operated by Thales, a French arms manufacturer. The lightweight multirole missiles (LMMs) are intended to protect against Russian drone and missile attacks. Ukrainian forces are already using LMMs with an initial order delivered late last year. The order is much bigger, worth up to Â£1.6bn and will involve Thales hiring an additional 200 people in Belfast. More reaction from other European leaders now, firstly fromPoland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk. He has posted on X to say ""Europe has woken up"", alongside a photograph of the leaders at the summit earlier today. Tusk says those present ""all speak with one voice about helping Ukraine, the need for close transatlantic cooperation and strengthening the eastern border"". Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has given her reaction too, and says ""the one thing we absolutely cannot afford is a peace [in Ukraine] that does not last"". She continues: ""We must be very careful when assessing what is being proposed, particularly in response to this key question: could this peace be violated? Because, unfortunately, we have seen this happen in the past."" And there have been words on X too from outgoingGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who mentions that being ""transatlantic allies"" in Nato remains ""the key for security"" in the US, Canada and Europe. He says the alliance has been strengthened in recent years ""with new members and defence spending"" and that is ""the path we will continue to follow in the future as well"". Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, also on X, reiterates that Europe ""must take a greater role in ensuring safety for our continent"" and adds that ""good transatlantic relations are also indispensable"". Over the past 48 hours, we've seen several pro-Ukraine marches take place in Europe and the US - including today in London as leaders met to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Here are some pictures from the latest demonstrations: Demonstrators set up outside Downing Street as Starmer hosted close European allies and Volodymyr Zelensky at Lancaster House There was a demonstration on Avenue des Arts in front of the US embassy in Brussels A woman marches in support of Ukraine in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin yesterday A crowd of pro-Ukraine demonstrators also assembled in Turin, northern Italy, earlier today And people gather on the Boston Common in support of Ukraine and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Boston, Massachusetts Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring's Russia editor Zelensky not wearing a suit to a meeting with the King was always going to attract commentary, but the symbolism of his trademark informal shirt shot up following the spat in the Oval Office on Friday. Donald Trump â	“who had referred to himself as king,externalon social media days earlier - appeared to have an issue with it, and one conservative US reporter present at the tempestuous meeting accused the Ukrainian president of â	“not respecting the dignity of this officeâ	”. Looks like King Charles has no such problems with Zelenskyâ	’s attire. Before we heard from Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Nato chief Mark Rutte was speaking to reporters outside Lancaster House as he left this afternoon's summit and described the talks as ""really positive"". He said that ""more European countries will ramp up defence spendingâ	” but did not go into specifics. Rutte described increased defence spending as ""very good news"" and reiterated the need for ""more of a fair balance"" with the US. He also told reporters that the first step was to make sure there is a peace deal before there are discussions about how to guarantee it. We're seeing some more pictures now from the meeting at Sandringham Estate between King Charles and Zelensky. The pair's meeting was announced yesterday and Zelensky made his way to meet with the King after the summit of European leaders at Lancaster House, in central London. We've just heard from UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer following the summit in London where leaders from Europe, Canada and Turkey met to discuss working together for the security of Ukraine and the continent as a whole. Starmer said ""we are at a crossroads in history,"" and unveiled the following plans: We'll keep brining you analysis and reaction to the European leaders summit throughout the evening. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk for his meeting with King Charles. Local people, some holding Ukraine flags, gathered outside the estate to try to witness his arrival. Finally, Starmer is asked whether he fears that the West might split over its support for Ukraine - a reference to relations between Europe and the US. The question came after comments made earlier by Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, who said the West must ""avoid the risk"" of dividing. Starmer says that he and Meloni share ""a huge amount of common ground"" on feeling that Europe and the US have to stand together. He adds that it is important for the security of Europe that the continent works closely aligned with the US. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-directs-idf-to-prepare-to-defend-syrian-druze-village-under-attack-by-regime/,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have instructed the IDF to “prepare to defend” the Druze-majority city of Jaramana on the outskirts of Damascus in Syria. A statement issued by Katz’s office says the city is “currently under attack by the forces of the Syrian regime.” “We will not allow the extreme Islamic regime in Syria to harm the Druze. If the regime harms the Druze, it will be struck by us,” Katz says. “We are committed to our Druze brothers in Israel to do everything to prevent harm to their Druze brothers in Syria, and we will take all the steps required to maintain their safety,” he adds. According to reports from Syria, authorities have been clashing with local gunmen during a security campaign in Jaramana.","Netanyahu, Katz direct IDF to ‘prepare to defend’ Syrian Druze locale ‘under attack by regime’",Emanuel Fabian,The Times of Israel,2025-03-01T18:14:14,2025-03-01T18:23:56,gemini-2.0-flash

https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202503/01/content_WS67c3046cc6d0868f4e8f02fc.html,"BEIJING, March 1 -- China's national ""two sessions,"" a key political event shaping the country's policy direction, are set to convene in Beijing next week against the backdrop of a complex and challenging domestic and global environment. The annual session of the top political advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, will commence on Tuesday. The session of the top legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), will open on Wednesday. The Chinese premier, top legislator, top political advisor, chief justice, and top procurator will present work reports. Lawmakers will review the government's annual budget and development plan. They will deliberate an amendment to the law on deputies to the NPC and local people's congresses. On the sidelines of the event, ministers from various government departments will engage with the public through interviews and press conferences, clarifying policies and responding to pressing concerns. The ""two sessions"" serve as a critical window to observe China's development plan for the coming year. Decisions and policy announcements made here will not only affect the lives of 1.4 billion Chinese but also have an impact outside the country's borders. So, what can be expected from this year's ""two sessions""? GROWTH TARGET FOR 2025 Typically, the GDP growth target set in the government work report is one of the most closely watched figures. As China's economy shifts toward high-quality development, GDP is not the sole measure of the economy. But it remains an important indicator. In 2024, China achieved its growth target of around 5 percent, thanks in large part to a series of significant macroeconomic measures introduced to offset economic downturn pressure. GDP growth serves as a cornerstone metric with profound and wide-ranging significance. Despite the challenges China's economy has faced in recent years, it is projected to contribute about 30 percent of global economic growth in 2024, making it the largest source of growth for the world economy. INCREMENTAL POLICIES To achieve its growth target, China will roll out more targeted policies to stimulate economic activity. The government work report is expected to announce policy measures to ensure the goal is met. China has already signaled a shift in its macroeconomic stance. At the Central Economic Work Conference last December, policymakers pledged to roll out more proactive macro policies in 2025. Notably, they decided to adopt a ""moderately loose"" monetary policy, marking a significant departure from the ""prudent"" approach over the past 14 years. The meeting outlined nine key priorities, with boosting consumption at the forefront. This reflects China's emphasis on domestic demand as a top economic priority. In 2025, large-scale equipment upgrades and consumer goods trade-in programs are expected to be promoted with greater intensity and in a broader scope. According to Finance Minister Lan Fo'an, China in 2025 will actively use the room for a higher deficit, increase the issuance of local government special-purpose bonds, continue to issue ultra-long special treasury bonds, and increase transfer payments from the central government to local governments. The specifics of these plans will also be a key focus of this year's ""two sessions."" INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LEADERS, LEGISLATORS, ADVISORS During the ""two sessions,"" Chinese leaders, who are NPC deputies themselves, will interact with their fellow lawmakers at group deliberations. They will also interact with political advisors to discuss hotspot topics that matter most to state governance. These interactions serve as a window for observing how the central leadership stays informed about grassroots realities. This is a defining feature of Chinese democracy, often described in contemporary discourse as whole-process people's democracy. In recent years, President Xi Jinping, a deputy of Jiangsu Province's delegation to the 14th NPC, has typically participated in the delegation's deliberations. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, also attended the meetings of the NPC delegation of the armed forces and joined group discussions of political advisors from various sectors. During these interactions, Xi emphasized key priorities such as supporting the growth of the private sector and private enterprises, accelerating digital economy development, and advancing high-level opening-up -- all crucial to China's economic and social progress. FOREIGN POLICY The ""two sessions"" also shed light on China's foreign policy, as the foreign minister typically holds a press conference on the sidelines of the meetings. Last year, Foreign Minister Wang Yi answered 21 questions during a 90-minute press conference, with journalists from across the world participating. The foreign minister touched on various regional and international hotspot issues, such as the Ukraine crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He also expounded on China's foreign policies toward Russia, the United States, Europe, and Global South countries. During this year's ""two sessions,"" China's propositions on international relations are particularly noteworthy against the backdrop of a rapidly changing and turbulent global landscape. AI, INNOVATION Without a doubt, technological innovation will be a key focus during this year's ""two sessions,"" with the artificial intelligence (AI) industry very likely to take center stage. Over the past month, Chinese tech start-up DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the global AI industry and capital markets by introducing an open-source and popular chatbot. Domestically, companies such as Tencent, Baidu, and BYD have begun integrating DeepSeek into their products. Some local governments have also announced collaborations with the DeepSeek AI model to enhance public services, while others have organized training sessions to help officials and business professionals better understand the development and applications of DeepSeek and other AI technologies. In fact, AI has already emerged as one of the hottest topics at many of this year's provincial-level ""two sessions."" Many AI-related plans mentioned in provincial government work reports focus on building innovation platforms, promoting deeper industry integration, and improving policy frameworks. It's important to note that the rise of innovations like DeepSeek reflects China's commitment to taking the lead in technological advancements and its broader strategic focus on talent cultivation, innovation-friendly environment, business environment improvements, and the nurturing of non-public investments. These elements are expected to be underscored during the ""two sessions."" Additionally, the sessions provide a crucial platform for lawmakers and political advisors to offer suggestions and foster broad consensus on national development. Some of them are corporate executives and leading researchers. What AI-related proposals and suggestions they will present will be a major point of interest for China watchers.",Things to watch at China's 2025 'two sessions',Xinhua,www.gov.cn,2025-03-01T20:58,2025-03-01T20:58,gemini-2.0-flash

Outbound shipments came to US$52.6 billion last month, compared with $52.1 billion a year ago, according to data compiled by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. Imports rose 0.2 percent on-year to $48.3 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $4.3 billion. Exports returned to growth just a month after they decreased in January due to a fewer number of business days. This Feb. 19, 2025, file photo shows cars waiting to be exported near a port in Pyeongtaek, about 65 kilometers south of Seoul. (Yonhap) The ministry said the rise in exports came on the back of the robust performance of automobiles and computers, which includes solid-state drives (SSDs). Automobile exports jumped 17.8 percent on-year to $6.1 billion last month, snapping their three-month losing streak. In particular, overseas sales of hybrid cars soared 74.3 percent to $1.3 billion. Exports of computers, including SSDs, advanced 28.5 percent to $800 million to extend their on-year gains to the 14th consecutive month, and exports of wireless communication equipment surged 42.3 percent to $1.5 billion. Bio-health exports climbed 16.1 percent to $1.4 billion, with biopharmaceutical sales, in particular, shooting up 45.5 percent. Outbound shipments of chips, however, dropped 3 percent on-year to $9.6 billion last month, due to a steep fall in the price of memory chips. Exports of petroleum products decreased 12.2 percent to $3.9 billion due to a decline in gasoline and diesel prices. Exports of ships and rechargeable batteries also dipped 10.8 percent and 9.6 percent to $1.6 billion and $630 million, respectively. This file photo taken Feb. 12, 2025, shows a port in Busan, about 325 kilometers southeast of Seoul. (Yonhap) By destination, exports to China slipped 1.4 percent to $9.5 billion last month due to sluggish chip sales, while exports to the United States rose 1 percent to $9.9 billion, thanks to strong demand for chips and computers. Outbound shipments to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) gained 12.6 percent to $9.6 billion on the back of strong sales of chips and petroleum products, logging the second-largest export volume for any February. Exports to India expanded 18.6 percent to a record $1.7 billion for February, and outbound shipments to the Middle East increased 19.6 percent to $1.7 billion. Exports to the European Union shed 8.1 percent to $5.2 billion.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250301000351320?section=economy-finance/economy,"(ATTN: ADDS more info in paras 5-8, 11) SEOUL, March 1 (Yonhap) -- South Korean Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun has filed a request with the U.S. government to exclude South Korea from its new tariff plans while discussing expanding bilateral cooperation in various fields, Ahn's office said Saturday. Ahn made the request as he met with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer, U.S. Secretary of Interior and National Energy Dominance Council Chairman Doug Burgum, and other officials during his trip to Washington, D.C., this week, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. Ahn's trip came amid mounting concerns over the plan of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to impose 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, as well as to introduce reciprocal tariffs, and his consideration of new tariffs on cars, chips and pharmaceuticals. It marked the first visit to Washington by a ministerial official from Seoul since Trump took office last month. ""I have relayed South Korean businesses' concerns over tariff plans (to the U.S. side) and requested exemptions,"" Ahn said during a meeting with reporters near Washington. ""We plan to proceed with related discussions (with the U.S.) through working-level consultative bodies in a direction that minimizes potential damage to Korean enterprises."" Seoul is said to have underscored its position to the U.S. that it aims to secure tariff exemptions first and foremost, and that if it fails to get exemptions, it hopes to at least ensure that South Korea is not put at a disadvantage compared with other countries. In a meeting with Lutnick, Ahn conveyed Korean companies' concerns over Washington's tariff scheme, according to the industry ministry. Lutnick is said to have highlighted the need to address U.S. trade deficits and expressed hope for related cooperation with South Korea. The two sides also discussed bolstering their partnership in strategic industries, such as shipbuilding and advanced industries. To further discuss the issues, Ahn and Lutnick agreed to install respective working-level consultative bodies for talks on tariff plans and shipbuilding cooperation, the ministry said. Ahn is also said to have explained to the U.S. that when a Georgia factory of Hyundai Motor Co. starts its operation in earnest late next month, it could help substantially reduce U.S. trade deficits stemming from South Korean auto exports. In separate meetings with Greer and Burgum, the Korean industry minister discussed strengthening bilateral cooperation in energy and trade. The ministry said Ahn also met with Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who introduced a bill aimed at revitalizing the U.S. shipbuilding and maritime industries, to exchange views on bolstering cooperation in the sector. Ahn also met with Kevin D. Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation; John J. Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies; and Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, to discuss Seoul's strategy on U.S. trade policies. ""South Korea will work to earn the best results from systematic and earnest negotiations with the U.S. on new industry, trade and energy policies based on our experience of successfully responding to the U.S. CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act in the past,"" Ahn said in a press release. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) Industry minister asks U.S. to exclude S.

Negotiators from German election winner Friedrich Merz’s conservative bloc and the center-left Social Democrats started exploratory talks Friday on a possible coalition government, but were tightlipped on the details as they launched what could be a complicated process.Merz’s Union bloc, which has led the opposition since 2021, won Sunday’s election, in which the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany took second place. 

The only plausible choice of coalition partner for the Union — which like other mainstream parties rules out working with Alternative for Germany — is the Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. They slumped to third place and their worst post-World War II result in a German parliamentary election on Sunday.Between them, the Union and Social Democrats have 328 seats in the newly elected 630-seat parliament.

In a brief statement after a first round of talks on Friday, the two sides said the discussions “began in an open and constructive atmosphere.” They said that Finance Minister Jörg Kukies offered an overview of Germany’s budget situation and upcoming talks will discuss “the challenges.” 

Another round will be held next week, according to the statement, which gave no specific date. At some point, negotiators will have to decide whether to move on to formal coalition talks.The possible partners will have to reconcile contrasting proposals for revitalizing the economy, which has shrunk for the past two years, and for curbing irregular migration — an issue that Merz pushed hard during the election campaign. They will also need to overcome distrust generated during the campaign.

Merz has said he hopes to do a deal by Easter. That may be an optimistic timeframe, although other recent governments have been in place within two or three months of an election. 

There is no deadline for forming a government, and the record is much longer.

https://apnews.com/article/ontario-canada-election-doug-ford-d81f6b94cfbd3ad038362432cd8c3c53,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Ontario Premier Doug Ford won reelection to lead Canada’s most populous province on Thursday, giving him the mandate he wanted to fight tariffs threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump. “Donald Trump thinks he can break us,” Ford told a cheering crowd at a Toronto convention center. “He thinks he can divide and conquer, pit region against region. Donald Trump doesn’t know what we know. “Let me be clear. Canada will never, ever be the 51st state. Canada is not for sale.” Unofficial results from Elections Ontario showed Ford’s Progressive Conservative Party would win a majority, giving him his third term as premier. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal Party will choose a new leader March 9, congratulated Ford on his victory. “At this crucial time, we must work together to defend Canadian interests, protect workers and businesses, and grow our economy,” Trudeau said in a statement. Ford called the election on Jan. 29, more than a year early. The Conservatives already held a majority with 79 seats. At the time, Ford said he needed a four-year mandate to protect Ontario, Canada’s manufacturing and automobile hub. Trump has threatened to implement 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports, with a lower 10% levy on energy, beginning Tuesday. He has also angered Canadians by talking about Canada becoming the the 51st U.S. state. During his speech, Ford said during his time as premier he has shown he will work with anyone to achieve results. “As we stare down the threat of Donald Trump’s tariffs, I will continue to do just that,” he said. “I will work with every level of government and every political stripe. Fighting back against Donald Trump, standing up for Canada, will take a full Team Ontario effort. It will take a full Team Canada effort.” During the campaign Ford made two trips to Washington to speak to U.S. government and business leaders about the tariffs. Ford has said his government is prepared to spend “tens of billions of dollars” to protect jobs and the economy of Ontario, and he has mused about making Americans pay more for the electricity Ontario sends to the U.S. Opposition parties accuse Ford of calling an early election before any potential charges emerge from a police investigation into his now-scrapped plan to develop lands under environmental protection. They also said the cost of the election could have been better spent on health care and affordable housing. Jonathan Malloy, a political scientist at Carleton University in Ottawa, said the tariff threats gave Ford the excuse he needed to call an early election. “Canadians are concerned with the Trump tariffs,” Malloy said. “Mr. Ford is being seen as being out front, responding to them. That’s politically advantageous for him.” With a population of around 16 million, Ontario is the Canadian province with the most people and an economy that makes up 38% of Canadian GDP. Unofficial results from Elections Ontario showed the Progressive Conservatives winning 82 seats, the New Democratic Party 25, the Liberals 14 and the Greens two, while one seat was won by an independent. When the election was called, the NDP had 28 seats, the Liberals had nine and the Greens had two, with six independents. A majority government requires at least 63 seats. The NDP under leader Marit Stiles returned as the official opposition while Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie failed to be reelected. Stiles said the people had spoken. “They re-elected the government hoping they would protect them against tariffs,” she said. “The threat is real.” During the campaign, Crombie promised to connect every Ontarian to a family doctor while Stiles addressed health care and affordability. Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner made promises about building more housing, protecting farmland and improving affordability. “I think this had been a very low-profile election,” said Malloy. “When Canadians are asked about the number one public issue these days, I’m sure they would say the Trump tariffs. That has overshadowed the election.”",Doug Ford reelected as Ontario’s premier with mandate to fight Trump tariffs,Jim Morris,AP News,2025-02-27T03:40:34,2025-02-27T23:25:33,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250301001000320?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, March 1 (Yonhap) -- Acting President Choi Sang-mok on Saturday underscored the need for ""national unity,"" saying South Korea is facing deepening conflicts and divisions as the nation commemorated the anniversary of the 1919 independence movement against Japan's colonial rule. Choi made the remarks at a ceremony marking the March 1 Independence Movement in Seoul. He spoke on behalf of President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose official duties have been suspended following his brief imposition of martial law in December. This year marks the 106th anniversary of the nationwide uprising against Japanese colonial rule, a pivotal moment in Korea's fight for independence during Japan's 1910-45 occupation of the Korean Peninsula. ""Today, shadows of conflict and division are growing darker in our society,"" Choi said, apparently referring to weeks of protests and the growing divide between Yoon's supporters and opponents. He pointed to ideological, generational, regional and class-based divisions, warning the future of the nation could be at risk if such issues are not addressed. ""To overcome the crisis before us and build a nation that future generations can take pride in, national unity is more important than ever,"" he stressed. Choi, who also serves as finance minister, highlighted economic challenges following a downward revision of South Korea's growth outlook due to prolonged political uncertainty and rising global trade protectionism. ""Geopolitical risks are intensifying worldwide, economic and trade uncertainties are growing, and international relations are rapidly shifting,"" he said. He vowed that the government will accelerate economic recovery by revitalizing the livelihoods of ordinary citizens and creating more jobs. The acting president also emphasized the importance of ""sustainability,"" which he said could be achieved through reform measures in various sectors, as well as policies aimed at balanced regional development in a country where wealth and infrastructure are heavily concentrated in the greater Seoul area. Choi further expressed hope for a new chapter in South Korea-Japan relations as this year marks the 60th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two.

https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-zelenskyy-set-to-meet-at-white-house/7991244.html,"WHITE HOUSE —
 A White House meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy aimed at securing a deal that would allow the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare mineral rights turned into a heated exchange with the two leaders talking over each other and Trump telling Zelenskyy, ""You're either going to make a deal or we're out.""
In a statement on social media after the meeting, Trump indicated the proposed deal is off.
""I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,"" Trump wrote.
""He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.""
The heated exchange, witnessed by dozens of American and Ukrainian reporters in the Oval Office, took a combative tone about 40 minutes into the meeting when Zelenskyy raised Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea.
U.S. Vice President JD Vance immediately criticized Zelenskyy, accusing him of engaging in a ""propaganda tour.""
""I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,"" he told Zelenskyy.
Vance and Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of not being thankful for the assistance his country has received from Washington.
""You don't have the cards right now,"" Trump said, raising his voice as Zelenskyy tried to rebut him. ""You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III.""
Zelenskyy left the White House early, and a scheduled joint press conference was canceled.
Later Friday, Trump told reporters before leaving the White House that the talks ""didn't work out exactly great.""
Trump said that if the U.S. signs the mineral deal, it is his impression that Zelenskyy is ""looking to go on and fight, fight, fight.""
""We are not looking to go into a 10-year war and play games,"" Trump said.
When asked by a reporter what Zelenskyy needs to do to restart talks, Trump responded, 'He's got to say, 'I want to make peace.'""
Zelenskyy response
Despite the abrupt end to the meeting, the Ukrainian leader took to social media soon after it ended to address the American public and U.S. leadership.
""Thank you America,"" Zelenskyy posted on the X social media platform. ""Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.""
Later Friday, Zelenskyy told Fox News that he believes the relationship between Ukraine and the U.S. can be salvaged and said he does not want to lose the United States as a partner. He added, however, he wants Trump to be ""more on our side.""
When asked if he should apologize to Trump, Zelenskyy said, ""I think that we have to be very open and very honest, and I'm not sure that we did something bad.""
Rare minerals deal
Before the meeting devolved, Trump said he was close to signing the deal with Zelenskyy.
""We have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging, and working and getting some of the rare earth,"" Trump told a visibly uncomfortable Zelenskyy.
The proposed deal included provisions for the co-ownership and management of a postwar reconstruction fund for Ukraine, to which Ukraine would allocate 50% of future revenues from the country's natural resources.
But a White House spokesperson said the agreement was not signed.

Fallout
House Democratic leader Hakeem Jefferies said in a statement: ""For three years, President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people have stood on the side of democracy, freedom and truth. Their success is in the national security interests of the United States. We should stand with Ukraine until victory is won.""
Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson wrote on Facebook: ""Thanks to President Trump — the days of America being taken advantage of and disrespected are OVER,"" adding what was seen in the Oval Office was an ""American President putting America first.""
The public collapse of talks between Trump and Zelenskyy was met with cheers from some Russian officials.
""The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office,"" Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia's National Security Council, posted on X.
Medvedev added that Trump ""is right: The Kiev [sic] regime is 'gambling with WWIII.'""
Zelenskyy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, defended the Ukrainian leader.
""The President is fighting for our country, for everyone who stands for a just and lasting peace,"" Yermak posted on X. ""Without real guarantees, war will return.""
Responses from Europe
European officials, including from France, Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, also took to social media to voice support for Ukraine.
""Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine,"" said European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs Kaja Kallas, posting on X.
'We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the aggressor,"" Kallas said. ""Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.""
First White House meeting
Trump and Zelenskyy have had in-person engagements in the past, but Friday marks their first one at the White House. Earlier this month, the pair spoke by phone after Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Since coming to office, Trump has increased his pressure campaign on Ukraine, claiming that Kyiv started the war with Russia and calling Zelenskyy a ""dictator."" Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Trump also has repeated a claim that the U.S. has spent $350 billion on Ukraine's war — a figure that far eclipses the amount recorded by the Department of Defense and the interagency oversight group that tracks U.S. appropriations to Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Trump is pursuing direct negotiations with Russia without the involvement of Kyiv or European allies. He defended them during his Thursday press conference as ""common sense.""
He described the talks as ""very well advanced"" but cautioned that there is only a narrow window to secure a deal to end the war. He expressed confidence that Putin will ""keep his word"" and not launch further aggression on Ukraine should a peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv be reached.

https://www.jpost.com/international/internationalrussia-ukraine-war/article-844170,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky left the White House early on Friday after a contentious Oval Office meeting with US President Donald Trump, a White House official said. Minutes before Zelensky's premature departure, the US president and his Vice President JD Vance shared an explosive confrontation with the Ukrainian president, in which Trump accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for the support provided by the United States. Watch this carefully. Very important. Vance accused Zelensky of being “disrespectful” and demanded he thank Trump. Trump warned that failing to accept a US-led peace deal with Russia, which invaded Ukraine in 2022, would mean “gambling with World War III.” “You’re either going make a deal or we’re out,” Trump added. “And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out and I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.” ""You don't have the cards. Once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. But you're not acting at all thankful, and that's not a nice thing. I'll be honest. That's not a nice thing."" Zelensky openly challenged Trump over his softer approach toward Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to ""make no compromises with a killer."" He also pushed back on Trump's claims that Ukrainian cities have been reduced to rubble by three years of war. Trump stressed that Putin wants to make a deal. After the exchange, Trump posted on his Truth Social account that Zelensky was not ready to end the war but could ""come back when he is ready for peace."" “We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved,"" Trump wrote, ""because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.” Trump-Zelensky summit explodes: ""He can come back when he is ready for peace"" Trump later told reporters on Friday that  Zelensky did not look like a man who wanted peace. The agreement negotiated in recent days would open Ukraine's vast mineral wealth to the United States but does not include explicit American security guarantees for Ukraine, a disappointment for Kyiv. Trump says the presence of Americans in business would serve as a form of guarantee. How much the deal would be worth to the United States is not spelled out. Trump has said he expects to gain hundreds of billions of dollars. Zelensky has said he would not sign an agreement that would put his country in debt for generations. Ukraine would contribute 50% of ""all revenues earned from the future monetization of all relevant Ukrainian Government-owned natural resource assets"" to a reconstruction fund jointly owned and managed by the United States and Ukraine. The agreement does not specify how the funds would be spent, or identify specific assets it covers, though it says they would include deposits of minerals, oil and natural gas as well as infrastructure such as gas terminals and ports. The Washington talks are a diplomatic boost for Zelensky who has repeatedly spoken of the importance of meeting Trump in person before the US president holds talks with Putin. ""The Ukrainians have been quite savvy at turning it round, and using this (the minerals deal) as an opening to engage the US,"" said a senior Kyiv-based European diplomat, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Kyiv hopes the agreement will spur Trump to back Ukraine's war effort, and potentially even win support from Republicans in Congress for a new round of aid. Ukraine has rapidly expanded its defense industry production but remains heavily reliant on foreign military assistance, while also struggling to replenish manpower as it battles a much larger foe. While Ukraine repelled Russia's invasion from the outskirts of Kyiv and recaptured swathes of territory in 2022, Russia still controls around a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly taking ground since a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023. Kyiv's troops hold a chunk of land in Russia's western Kursk region after a 2024 incursion.",Zelensky leaves White House early as Trump claims he ‘disrespected US’ in Oval Office spat,"JERUSALEM POST STAFF, REUTERS",The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-28T18:50:28,2025-03-01T14:08:00,gemini-2.0-flash

The meeting with Donald Trump had been seen as a potential diplomatic win for Volodymyr Zelensky in his pursuit of a security guarantee from the United States in return for joint investment in Ukraine’s critical minerals – a move that could also counter Chinese dominance of the resources. However, the initially cordial meeting in the Oval Office devolved in front of US and international media as Zelensky – pressed by US Vice-President J.D. Vance for not trusting Russian President Vladimir Putin – questioned the virtues of diplomacy with Moscow and Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of being disrespectful. Zelensky challenged Trump over his approach towards Putin, urging him to make “no compromises with a killer”. Trump responded: “You don’t have the cards. Once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position. But you’re not acting at all thankful, and that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest.

The Channel 12 report comes soon after it is said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold consultations this evening with senior ministers and defense officials on the subject of the hostage-ceasefire deal. It is rare for the premier to hold such discussions on a Friday evening, the Jewish Sabbath. An Israeli delegation dispatched to Cairo yesterday for “intensive” talks on the future of the Gaza hostage-ceasefire deal with Hamas was said to have proposed the first phase extension. Hamas reportedly opposes the extension and insists on proceeding to the second phase of the deal as originally agreed. The second phase is meant to include steps leading to a permanent end to the war, including a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Strip. A diplomatic source said the Israeli delegation was to return from Cairo Friday night. Supporting The Times of Israel isn’t a transaction for an online service, like subscribing to Netflix.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/frontline-countries-pitch-e10-billion-defence-line-for-russia-belarus-border/,"In a document sent to the European Commission, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania outline details for the creation of a defence line on the border with Belarus and Russia, and put price tags on several continent-wide defence projects. The document is intended to influence the drafting of the White paper on the future of the bloc’s defence, which is expected to identify major defence projects in which Europeans should invest for the benefit of all, and where to find the money. The list of projects first reported by Euractiv, has been repeatedly confirmed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in recent weeks. The North-East Border Shield is under consideration, along with ammunition stockpiles, an air defence shield, or maritime domain awareness. It would bring together Poland's Eastern Shield, the Baltic states' Baltic Defence Line, and could include Finland's 1,340-kilometre-long border with Russia and countries to the south. According to the calculations of Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the investment needed for this project is around €8-10 billion for a long list of items. For the frontline states, protecting the border with Russia and Belarus is key to defending the European Union. It first became an obvious point of tension after Moscow and Minsk organised what the Europeans called “instrumentalised migration”, in an attempt to divide and destabilise the Europeans. Since Moscow attacked Ukraine three years ago, fortifying the border has only become a higher priority for the neighbouring countries. “We need to take urgent actions to increase counter-mobility, enhance air surveillance and air defence, electronic defence, and underwater security of our borders,” the countries write in a document seen by Euractiv. In their list, they propose that EU countries jointly invest in infrastructure with fortifications, high-tech border surveillance systems, electronic warfare capabilities, drones and counter-drone measures. It also includes warehouses to store equipment, fuel, ammunition and explosives, as well as logistics for transport and shelters. They are also asking for more regulation. Though they are calling for a ""robust line of defence covering land, air, sea and other relevant domains"" along the EU's border with Russia and Belarus, the countries do not include sophisticated air and missile defence systems, fighter jets or navel assets in their shopping list, which would add significantly to the price tag. For reference, a European air defence shield would amount to €500 billion, the European Commission estimates. Later in the document, they estimate that protecting the necessary underwater infrastructure from cyber-attacks, sabotage and other threats would cost at least €2 billion at EU level. With this pot of money, they recommend the creation of a ""modular and multi-layered underwater defence dome, including surveillance, monitoring and potential counter-defence capabilities"" and the establishment of an information exchange on threats and accidents. Improving the military mobility of troops and equipment on the continent should also benefit from €10 billion, they said. In total, the EU should provide €100 billion to boost the continent's defence capabilities by 2028, on top of national investments, they added. A total of €50 billion at EU level should be spent on stockpiling ammunition and missiles, in addition to national investments, the document says. This could help companies to stockpile essential components such as propellants, explosives and shells, the four countries write, highlighting a move foreseen in the EU Defence Industry Programme (EDIP) currently under negotiation. Ammunition and missiles have proved to be essential equipment in a war, alongside more advanced technologies. European munition stockpiles for Ukraine are security guarantees, France added. “Stocks of weapons in Europe, perhaps also paid for by Europeans for Ukraine” also count as “security guarantees,” French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu said on Thursday. When it comes to production and procurement, EU-level programmes for joint procurement (EDIRPA) and production (ASAP) of ammunition and missiles could be extended to include “battle-decisive munitions alongside 155mm artillery ammunition, notably anti-tank, loitering, and air defence munitions,” they also write. Widening the scope of the two initiatives to include more types of equipment could bring faster results, some diplomats have suggested, although their legal regimes would make it complicated, a Commission official said.",Frontline countries pitch €10 billion defence line for Russia-Belarus border,Aurélie Pugnet,EURACTIV,2025-02-28T13:01:15,2025-02-28T13:01:15,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-minister-anneliese-dodds-quit-keir-starmer-slashe-aid-boost-defense-spending/,"LONDON — Anneliese Dodds resigned as Britain's international development minister Friday after the government cut overseas aid contributions to fund increased defense spending. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Tuesday that international development funding would fall from 0.5 percent to 0.3 percent of  gross national income from 2027 in a bid to fund a defense spending increase. He insisted it was ""not an announcement I am happy to make” and that the U.K. would continue playing a humanitarian role in Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza. But Dodds, resigning Friday, warned it would be ""impossible to maintain these priorities given the depth of the cut"" and said the effect ""would be far greater than presented."" The former development minister, who previously served as Starmer's shadow chancellor, warned the move would likely lead to a British withdrawal from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations ""at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence."" She also claimed the U.K. would have a reduced voice in the G7, G20 and World Bank and be ""shut out"" of multiple  multilateral bodies. She earned against the decision being portrayed as following Trump's own ""slipstream of cuts"" to the U.S. Agency for International Development. Dodds said she had delayed her resignation until Starmer's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump Thursday was complete so you ""had a united Cabinet behind you."" But losing a close ally will be seen as a blow for the prime minister after his engagement with Trump went down positively. In a letter responding to Dodds Friday, Starmer praised her “hard work, deep commitment and friendship,” and left the door open to her return by saying she “will have more to contribute in the future.” But he mounted a robust defense of his move to cut aid, arguing it was not a decision taken without consideration of the consequences and insisting the government will try to find a path back to restoring development spending. “The decision I have taken on the impact on ODA was a difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly,” he said, according to a copy of the letter provided by No.10 Downing Street. “We will do everything we can to return to a world where that is not the case and to rebuild a capability on development. However, protecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government and I will always act in the best interests of the British people.” Former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, a Conservative, backed Dodds' decision to quit. ""Labour’s disgraceful and cynical actions demean the Labour Party ‘s reputation as they balance the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world,"" the Tory MP told POLITICO. ""Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle."" Development spending was previously cut by the Tories from 0.7 to 0.5 percent in 2021 in response to Covid-19. The party also scrapped Britain’s dedicated aid department under Boris Johnson.

https://apnews.com/article/india-eu-modi-ursula-von-der-leyen-309ab4795ad0206b66fe20bef5ca9a92,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India and the European Union have agreed to finalize a long-pending free trade agreement this year and boost cooperation in trade, technology, connectivity and defense, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the European Commission chief said Friday. Modi said after meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that the two sides have directed their teams to conclude the bilateral free trade deal by end of this year. Modi said many decisions were taken to “elevate and accelerate India-EU partnership” in the meeting. “India-EU strategic partnership is natural. Its core is trust and shared belief in democratic values,” Modi said. The European Commission chief said the “free trade agreement between the EU and India would be the largest deal of this kind anywhere in the world.” Brussels is ramping up efforts to seal with deal with New Delhi in the face of potential U.S. tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the EU with tariffs of 25%. “It is time to be pragmatic and ambitious. And to realign our priorities for today’s realities,” von der Leyen said at an address to a think tank in New Delhi before meeting with Modi. “You can count on my full commitment to make sure we can deliver.” Related Stories India will include caste details in its next census Rubio calls India and Pakistan in effort to defuse crisis over Kashmir attack Indian survivors of Kashmir attack say gunmen asked if they were Hindus and opened fire The European Commission chief is in India on a two-day visit from Thursday and is accompanied by top leaders of EU member nations. India and the EU relaunched talks on the bilateral agreement in 2021, but issues like market access for products such as cars and alcoholic beverages have been sticking points. The next round of negotiations is set to take place in March. India and the EU cooperate closely on issues including foreign policy, security and technology. The EU is India’s largest trading partner, ahead of the U.S. and China. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, exports and imports to the European bloc accounted for more than $130 billion, marking an increase of about 90% over the past decade. Over 6,000 European companies are also present in India. Von der Leyen said the EU and India have the potential to be one of the defining partnerships of this century. “I want this visit to be the start of this new era. Prime Minister Modi and I share the same view. It is time to take our EU-India Strategic Partnership to the next level,” she said. For New Delhi, the trade talks have renewed significance after Trump’s decision to impose reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from countries including India. Last year India signed a trade agreement with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, who comprise the European Free Trade Association, that includes a commitment of $100 billion in investments.

https://apnews.com/article/senegal-casamance-rebels-peace-47df8201d4be0259309b8497b5996e91,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — A new peace deal between Senegal and a separatist rebel group in the country’s southern region has been touted by the government as a key step in ending one of Africa’s longest conflicts. Analysts, however, say it did not involve all the rebels and fails to address the root causes of the conflict. The deal, signed by the government and the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance was announced by Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko during a visit to neighboring Guinea-Bissau on Monday. Past peace deals have failed to end the fighting in the Casamance region, which is separated from the rest of Senegal by the nation of Gambia and has historically suffered from lower development rates and access to markets in the more prosperous north. The rebels have been fighting for Casamance’s independence since the early 1980s, arguing that the region has suffered neglect by the government. Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko touted the latest peace agreement as an important step in ensuring lasting peace in Casamance, home to some 1.6 million people. The deal offered a presidential pardon for imprisoned rebels as well as amnesty and a social reintegration path for other rebels, according to Vincent Foucher, a political scientist at the France-based National Center for Scientific Research, with knowledge of the agreement. However, it involves only a faction of the rebel group that is less potent than two others and excludes the hardline faction led by Salif Sadio, the most powerful of the rebel leaders, said Foucher. “I don’t see a solution yet. It’s a continuation of endless discussions with a divided movement,” he said. “The Senegalese state is not prepared to make the political or administrative concessions demanded by the other factions that have not signed the peace agreement.” Senegal’s government did not immediately respond to AP’s inquiry for comments about the claims. The rebels’ calls for the region’s independence will be difficult to neglect despite the new deal, said Mohamed Traoré, a doctoral researcher at the Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar. “Casamance nationals, especially the young, are proud to belong to the Senegalese state today, but the MFDC’s hard wing continues to call for independence,” said Traoré. The rebels have not publicly spoken about the deal.  However, Amidou Djiba, a spokesman for one of the factions not involved in the peace deal, earlier this year accused Senegal’s government of “choosing the people it talks to,” a trend he said would not help the return of peace in the region. ___ Ahmed reported from Bamako, Mali.",Senegal has signed a deal with separatist rebels.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-02-27-2025-cfcdd8786afe4bc73ae79b3e0e4ccb3b,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Negotiations between Israel and Hamas on the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire began Thursday, Egypt said, averting a collapse ahead of Saturday’s expiration of the agreement’s first phase. Officials from Israel, Qatar and the United States started “intensive discussions” on the ceasefire’s second phase in Cairo, Egypt‘s state information service said. “The mediators are also discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region,” its statement said. Phase 2 talks are meant to negotiate an end to the war, including the return of all remaining hostages in Gaza who are alive, and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the territory. Return of remaining deceased hostages would happen in Phase 3. According to Israel, there are 59 remaining hostages — 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. It will be difficult to reconcile a deal with the war objectives of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has called for dismantling Hamas’ governing and military capabilities. After suffering heavy losses in the war, Hamas has nonetheless emerged intact during the ceasefire, and the group says it will not give up its weapons. Hours before talks began, an Israeli official said the country would not withdraw from a strategic corridor in the Gaza Strip as called for under the ceasefire, a refusal that could severely complicate negotiations with Hamas and key mediator Egypt at a sensitive moment for the fragile truce. Overnight, Hamas released the remains of four hostages in exchange for over 600 Palestinian prisoners, the last planned swap of the ceasefire’s first phase. U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, was expected in the region in the coming days.  An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the army needed to remain in the so-called Philadelphi corridor, on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, to prevent weapons smuggling. Separately, Defense Minister Israel Katz said at a meeting with local leaders that he had seen tunnels penetrating the border on a recent visit to the corridor, without providing evidence or elaborating on Israel’s plans. Egypt says it destroyed the smuggling tunnels from its side years ago and set up a military buffer zone to halt smuggling. Hamas said any Israeli attempt to maintain a buffer zone in the corridor would be a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire agreement. The militant group says that sticking to the agreement is the only way for Israel to secure the release of dozens of hostages still held in Gaza. Israel was supposed to begin withdrawing from the Philadelphi corridor on Saturday, the last day of the first phase, and complete it within eight days. There was no immediate comment about the corridor from Egypt, which is opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of its border. The remains released Thursday were confirmed to be those of Ohad Yahalomi, Itzhak Elgarat, Shlomo Mantzur and Tsachi Idan, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents families of the captives. Mantzur, 85, was killed in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, and his body was taken into the territory. Israel said the other three were killed in captivity, without elaborating. “Our hearts ache upon receiving the bitter news,” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said. “In this painful moment, there is some solace in knowing that they will be laid to rest in dignity in Israel.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he shared the “immense pain” of the family and loved ones of Yahalomi, who had French citizenship. Hamas confirmed that over 600 prisoners had been released overnight. Most were detainees returned to Gaza, where they had been rounded up after the Oct. 7 attack and held without charge on security suspicions. Dozens of Palestinian teenagers as well as women detained by Israel in Gaza were released Thursday back to hugs and tears from their loved ones. The teenagers looked gaunt and skinny as they disembarked from Red Cross buses in the southern town of Khan Younis. Many fell into the arms of relatives, who spent days waiting for them after Israel held up their release last weekend to protest what it called cruel treatment of hostages by Hamas during their releases. Women cried and hugged the boys. The Palestinian prisoners club, a group representing current and former prisoners, said those released into Gaza Thursday were 44 male teenagers aged 15-19 and two women. In a separate prisoner release overnight, some fell to their knees in gratitude after disembarking in Khan Younis. In the West Bank town of Beitunia, dozens of prisoners were welcomed by crowds of relatives and well-wishers. Israel had delayed the release of the prisoners on Saturday over Hamas’ practice of parading hostages before crowds and cameras during their release. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have called the ceremonies humiliating for the hostages. Hamas released the four bodies to the Red Cross in Gaza overnight without a public ceremony. The prisoners released Thursday included 445 men, 21 teenagers and one woman, according to lists shared by Palestinian officials that did not specify their ages. Only around 50 Palestinians were released into the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem in this round, while dozens sentenced to life over deadly attacks against Israelis were exiled. The latest handover was the final one planned under the ceasefire’s first six-week phase, which expires this weekend. Hamas has returned 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to return all the hostages and destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas, which remains in control of Gaza. The Trump administration has endorsed both goals.  But it’s unclear how Israel would destroy Hamas without resuming the war, and Hamas is unlikely to release the remaining hostages — its main bargaining chips — without a lasting ceasefire. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of war that erupted after Hamas’ 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. About 250 people were taken hostage.  Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say over half the dead have been women and children. The fighting displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population and decimated the territory’s infrastructure and health system. In northern Israel, police said a driver rammed his car into people at a highway bus stop, wounding at least eight Thursday in what authorities believe was a militant attack. Police said they had “neutralized” the suspect, who they described as a 53-year-old Palestinian from the northern West Bank who lived in Israel and was married to an Israeli citizen. Medical workers said the ramming injured at least eight people, two in serious condition, who they evacuated to the hospital. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip and Melzer from Nahariya, Israel.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250227000400315,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 (Yonhap) -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday the United States will not ""abandon"" relations with its two East Asian treaty allies, South Korea and Japan, as he addressed a question over America's defense commitment to Taiwan. Rubio made the remarks in a Fox News interview, amid lingering concerns that under President Donald Trump's America First credo and his perceived transactional foreign policy approach, the U.S.' security commitments to allies could weaken. ""We have to be present in the Indo-Pacific. They're trying to drive us out,"" he said, apparently referring to his view on China's intentions. ""We are a Pacific nation ... So, we have relationships in the Pacific, and we're not going to abandon those -- Japan, South Korea."" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio looks on as he meets with Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, and Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya at the State Department in Washington on Jan. 21, 2025 in this file photo released by Reuters. (Yonhap) The secretary also affirmed the U.S.' ""longstanding"" position on Taiwan that America is ""against any forced, compelled, coercive change in the status of Taiwan."" ""That's been our position since the late 1970s, and that continues to be our position, and that's not going to change,"" he said. On China, Rubio said that the U.S. has to deal with the reality that China will be a ""rich and powerful"" country, but stressed that the U.S. cannot allow for a world in which ""China is so powerful that we (have to) depend on them."" ""That's right now where we're headed, unfortunately. That's going to change under President Trump,"" the secretary said. He underlined the need for the U.S. to have its own domestic capabilities to ensure it does not have to rely on China. ""We've allowed way too many industries to fall into the hands of the Chinese, everything from rare earth minerals to pharmaceuticals,"" he said. ""We have to have a domestic capacity, and it's one of the ideas behind the tariffs that the President is pursuing writ large."" He also pointed out that the U.S. is lagging behind China's shipbuilding capacity, which he said amounts to a ""very serious vulnerability."" ""We have our aircraft manufacturing, our ship manufacturers. They are not keeping pace. China can build 10 ships before we can build one,"" he said. ""That's a very serious vulnerability that cannot continue. And obviously, I know (Defense Secretary) Pete has a plan for that, and the President has a plan for that, and they're working on it."" Optimism for shipbuilding cooperation between South Korea and the U.S. has risen as Trump mentioned his intent to work with Korea in the shipbuilding industry during a call with President Yoon Suk Yeol in November. During a radio interview last month, Trump also said that the U.S. may use allies in its efforts to build naval vessels. sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)","Rubio says U.S. will not 'abandon' relations with S.

""Following about a monthlong lull, North Korean troops were placed back in the frontline region of Kursk starting in the first week of February,"" the National Intelligence Service (NIS) said in a note to the press. ""It appears that there has been a deployment of additional troops, but their size is still being examined,"" the NIS said. The assessment follows a news report that between 1,000 and 3,000 North Korean troops were newly transported to Kursk via Russian cargo ships and military airplanes between January and February in the second round of such troop deployment. Following the report, South Korean military officials said signs of North Korea dispatching more than 1,000 additional troops to Russia this year have been detected. North Korea is believed to have deployed approximately 11,000 troops to Russia's western frontline region of Kursk last year. The NIS has earlier assessed that North Korean troops deployed to Russia had been absent from combat in the Kursk region since mid-January, likely due to heavy casualties among them. The agency estimated that about 300 were killed and some 2,700 others were wounded. pbr@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) N. Korea appears to have deployed additional troops to Russia: S.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250227010000315,"SEOUL, Feb. 27 (Yonhap) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin has held a meeting with the leader of a high-ranking North Korean party delegation visiting Moscow, a report showed Thursday. Putin met with Ri Hi-yong, a member of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party's Central Committee Politburo and secretary of the party's Central Committee, Russian news agency Ria Novosti said, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Ri arrived in Moscow on Monday for a visit at the invitation of Russia's ruling United Russia Party, according to the North's state media. No further details on the talks were immediately available. The North Korean delegation's visit came as the United States has begun negotiations to end Russia's war against Ukraine, for which North Korea dispatched thousands of troops to the Russian side. Since forging a mutual defense treaty last year, Pyongyang and Moscow have strengthened bilateral cooperation in defense, economy, sports and various other areas. mlee@yna.co.kr(END)",Putin holds talks with N.K.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-844014,"The Israeli and Qatari delegations arrived in Cairo to continue negotiations regarding the Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal, the Egyptian Information Ministry announced on Thursday night, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the hostage-ceasefire deal delegation to leave for the Egyptian capital. An American delegation is also participating in the talks regarding the ceasefire agreement, the Egyptian ministry said. The delegation will be led by Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Persons, Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch, as well as ""M,"" an anonymous officer from the Shin Bet. M is the former deputy of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, who is reportedly no longer part of the hostage deal negotiating team. In a Thursday meeting with Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský in Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said, ""Our delegation will depart for Cairo to assess whether there is common ground for extending the framework in exchange for the return of more hostages."" Israeli officials told The Jerusalem Post that Israel wants and is willing to continue phase one of the deal. This would mean that three hostages would continue to be released each week in return for humanitarian aid and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Hamas has also recently stated that the only way the remaining hostages will be freed is through a commitment to a ceasefire deal. Israel aspires to have the next hostages released as early as Saturday, an Israeli source stated, stressing that no agreement has yet been reached. The decision to send the negotiating team to Cairo was made during a telephone security consultation led by the Prime Minister and attended by Ministers Israel Katz, Ron Dermer, Gideon Sa'ar and Bezalel Smotrich, and Shas Chairman Arye Deri. Earlier on Thursday, Defense Minister Katz saidÂ	""Israel is prepared to extend the ceasefire to bring back more hostagesâall of them. The most effective way to achieve this goal is a real and credible military threatâand that is the strategy."" However, he alsoÂ	 said that ""Phase one has ended; we have brought back 25 hostages alive, including the female soldiers. This was not at all the case in some of the earlier stages of the negotiations, where the discussion was about 10 or 12 hostages. We also brought back 8 who are no longer alive.""",Benjamin Netanyahu sends Gaza hostage deal team to Cairo for talks,"AMICHAI STEIN, JERUSALEM POST STAFF",The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-27T10:10:00,2025-02-27T17:59:00,gemini-2.0-flash

We will not allow the Hamas murderers to again roam our borders with pickup trucks and guns, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling,” the Israeli official says, maintaining that Hamas had been using the route to sneak weapons into Gaza. In July, when Israel’s hostage negotiating team believed that it was on the verge of a hostage deal with Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added new conditions aimed at maintaining Israel’s presence in the Philadelphi Corridor, thereby scuttling the talks, Israeli and Arab officials have told The Times of Israel. Ultimately, though, the deal Netanyahu accepted six months later still requires Israel to begin completing its withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor on the 42nd day of phase one — this coming Saturday — and to finish that pull-out by the 50th day of the ceasefire (March 9). The Israeli official’s announcement comes shortly after Israeli authorities finished identifying the last four bodies of hostages released in phase one.

https://apnews.com/article/haiti-un-gangs-c8864c7f813cd47e92d4b2f29ad7eeff,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres is proposing opening a U.N. office that would provide drones, fuel, ground and air transportation and other non-lethal support to a Kenyan-led mission in Haiti struggling to fight gangs, according to a letter obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press. The letter was sent to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday night and provides the first details for a proposal that Guterres announced last week at a summit with Caribbean leaders. At the time, Guterres said he would request that the U.N. assume funding for the mission’s structural and logistical expenses but did not provide further information. The main goal of taking over that funding would be to encourage countries to boost the mission’s numbers; it currently has some 1,000 personnel out of the 2,500 envisioned. In his letter, Guterres assessed the situation in Haiti and warned it was running out of time. “We must act quickly,” he wrote. “I am convinced that the phased approach of the United Nations’ support… can reverse the shocking and rising trend in gang violence.” Guterres said his proposal is a “realistic option,” adding that “at this stage, transitioning to a U.N. peacekeeping operation is not…a feasible option.” The proposal comes as gangs that already control 85% of Haiti’s capital seized new neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince in recent weeks. The attacks have left more than 6,000 people homeless in the past month, according to the U.N. “Entire families were killed in their homes, while others, including children and babies, were shot dead as they tried to escape,” the U.N. said in a statement Tuesday. Guterres said in the letter that the U.N. office he proposes could help strengthen Haiti’s National Police and help gather, store and share sensitive information related to operations, as well as provide a joint operations center, data mapping support and surveillance via drones. In turn, Guterres said BINUH, the latest U.N. political mission in Haiti, could focus on priorities including designing programs to help children and women forced to join gangs defect from them, as well as support authorities in the arrests and prosecutions of “high-risk individuals.” The Security Council previously extended the U.N.-backed mission in Haiti led by Kenyan police to October of this year even as the U.S. and other countries warn it is lacking personnel and funding. Guterres noted in his letter that while the mission has reached 1,000 personnel, the vast majority of them Kenyan police, it still only represents 40% of the 2,500 personnel envisioned. In addition, a U.N. trust fund that relies on voluntary contributions and helps fund the mission has only $110.8 million. “Much more is needed,” Guterres wrote. He proposes that the U.N.'s peacekeeping budget pay for the mission’s equipment and logistical support and that voluntary donations keep financing the salaries of the mission’s personnel. Guterres noted that “many” of the mission’s armored vehicles are ill-equipped for the urban environment in Port-au-Prince and that a lack of spare parts has rendered half of all its combat vehicles inoperable. Last year, more than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti, 1,000 more deaths than reported the previous year. Gang violence also has left more than one million people homeless in recent years, according to the U.N. As gang violence surges across Haiti’s capital and beyond, the international community is pushing the troubled Caribbean country to hold elections. Diego Da Rin, an analyst with International Crisis Group, opposed the idea in an online symposium on Wednesday. “It would be a mistake to think that having elections in chaotic conditions without resolving…the security issue first would, by miracle, completely change the situation,” he said. “The situation is extremely dire.” ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at ",AP obtains letter detailing UN chief's proposal to help mission in Haiti,Dánica Coto,AP News,2025-02-26T18:58:07,2025-02-26T17:23:56,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/china-new-zealand-peters-drills-1b222c1a5f0bc519551ab8c95035d3ec,"BEIJING (AP) — China has agreed to consider concerns that its military did not give enough notice before staging live-fire exercises in the waters between New Zealand and Australia last week, the foreign minister of New Zealand said Wednesday. The drills prompted passenger flights between the two countries to divert in midflight after Chinese naval vessels warned pilots they were flying above a live-fire exercise. “I think it would be true to say that he took our concerns on board,” Foreign Minister Winston Peters said after meeting and having dinner with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in the Chinese capital. Peters said he put the issue in the context of the close ties that the two countries have developed since 2008. China is the biggest export destination for New Zealand and Australia. “We’re in the second decade of this arrangement, and this is a failure in it at this time, and we’d like to have it corrected in the future,” he said. He added, “That is something which we believe is under consideration.” Australia has complained more vociferously about the lack of notification. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she sought an explanation from China’s Wang Yi when the two met in Johannesburg last Saturday following a gathering of foreign ministers from the Group of 20 nations. At issue is how much in advance militaries should issue such warnings. China only gave “a couple of hours’ notice,” New Zealand’s Defense Minister Judith Collins told Radio New Zealand, rather than the expected 12 to 24 hours. A longer lead time would give airlines time to plan alternate routes. Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. China’s official Xinhua News Agency made no mention of the issue in an initial report on Peters’ meeting earlier in the day with Chinese Vice President Han Zheng. A Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson defended China’s actions on Sunday, saying the drills were in compliance with international law and did not affect aviation safety. Peters, who also is the deputy prime minister, is in the middle of an 11-day trip that began with stops in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After Beijing, he is visiting Mongolia and South Korea before his return to New Zealand on Monday. In his talks in Beijing, Peters said the return of President Donald Trump to the White House came up more than he had expected. He didn’t provide any details, but said that both sides agreed that “perhaps we should just wait and see what happens when the dust settles.” Peters said he also explained the unique relationship his country has with Cook Islands, which signed a series of agreements with China earlier this month that have raised concern in New Zealand. The government was angered when Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown refused to share the text of a draft cooperation agreement with China ahead of its signing. Citizens of Cook Islands have New Zealand passports, and New Zealand helps the small Pacific nation with its military and foreign affairs. In return, the Cook Islands government is required to consult New Zealand on matters that could affect the latter. “They need to understand the constitutional arrangement, which they said they did now,” Peters said of China.",New Zealand says China has agreed to consider concerns about its recent military drills,KEN MORITSUGU,AP News,2025-02-26T06:04:05,2025-02-26T13:53:58,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/un-latvia-russia-ukraine-war-putin-trump-ed920ae9ff7fc3570018bf5ba8b3edaa,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Latvia’s foreign minister warns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will try to achieve in peace talks what he hasn’t been able to accomplish in his war against Ukraine — weaken the United States and restore control over his smaller neighbor. Baiba Braže spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday during a week of intense diplomacy between Europe and the United States following President Donald Trump’s upending of U.S. policy with his decision to hold direct talks with Russia, while excluding Ukraine and its European allies from the initial discussions. Braže notes that Russia, with a population of 140 million, has managed to gain control of less than 20% of Ukraine, population 40 million, since it seized Crimea in 2014 and launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has failed to weaken the U.S. and the NATO military alliance it leads, or to oust the democratic government in Kyiv. So, when it comes to seeking peace, “I think the difficulty is with the Russians, because Russians are the ones who want to weaken U.S. power, and who want to weaken the U.S. in the world overall,” Braže said. What the world is seeing, she said, is that when Putin interferes in other countries he wants to control both territory and the political choices of their governments. In Syria, for example, he supported the authoritarian regime of Bashar Assad and got military bases on the Mediterranean. But Putin hasn’t gotten what he wanted during the three-year war in Ukraine and “he will try to get it through the peace talks,” Braže said. “So, it’s important to clearly remember that perspective in whatever deal we negotiate or strike.” She said although only U.S. and Russian officials took part in last week’s talks in Saudi Arabia, “Europe is included” in the peace discussions because of constant communications with both the Ukrainians and the Americans. She has been in Washington three times since mid-December and said she was heading there later Tuesday for talks with lawmakers and administration officials. French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House on Monday, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was due to meet with him on Thursday. Braže stressed that Europe’s task now is to strengthen the transatlantic alliance and build up its own militaries and defense industries. Last week, Latvia announced it will increase defense spending to 4% of GDP next year and continue to move toward 5%. NATO members have agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. “We are investing in our own capability,” she said. “We wish all Europeans would do that. That’s one of the issues we are discussing.” As NATO members, Braže said, Latvia and the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia and Lithuania need to make sure they are prepared for any future aggression from Russia. She said their focus is on deterrence — early warning, rapid response, military capability and political will. The three Baltic states were occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II and fell under Soviet control after the war. Like Ukraine, they became independent countries with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Braže stressed Monday to the U.N. Security Council that “only Ukraine’s victory can ensure lasting security and put an end to Russia’s imperialist aggression.” “We strongly believe that a rushed ceasefire will not lead to sustainable peace; instead, it will only embolden Russia, encouraging further expansion and putting global security at grave risk,” she said. Macron said he had spoken to 30 European and allied leaders, with some saying they are willing to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine in a peace deal. Braže said that while there have been preliminary discussions, there is no peace process yet. When there is, she said, “We will be guided very much by the needs of Ukraine.” “For any security force, we need military guidance,” Latvia’s top diplomat said. “We need military advice. What type of force is there? Where? Are the troops withdrawn on the Russian side from the contact line? How far? What is the location of any security force?” But Braže said the most important thing is peace must be long-lasting, not just a ceasefire where war can restart again. “Nobody wants that,” she said.",Latvia FM: Putin will try to achieve in peace talks what he couldn't in Ukraine war — weaken the US,Edith M.

Lee of the Democratic Party (DP) is considered the presidential frontrunner in the event President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment is upheld, but confirmation of his lower court sentence of one year in prison, suspended for two years, would bar him from running in the next presidential election in 2027. The opposition leader is accused of lying during a media interview in December 2021 that he did not know the late Kim Moon-ki, a former executive of Seongnam Development Corp., which was behind a corruption-ridden development project in Seongnam, south of Seoul, when Lee was the city's mayor. During the final hearing of his appellate trial in the day, the prosecution said Lee deserves ""a heavy punishment for distorting voters' choices by telling a lie."" The court said it plans to reach a verdict on March 26. Lee Jae-myung (C), the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, arrives at the Seoul High Court on Feb. 26, 2025, to attend the final hearing of his appellate trial on election law violation charges. (Yonhap) Upon arrival at the Seoul High Court for the session, Lee told reporters: ""The court will make the right judgment ... In the ways of the world, everything is bound to flow in the direction of common sense and principles."" Lee is also accused of lying during a parliamentary audit of the Gyeonggi provincial government in October 2021 that he was under pressure from the land ministry to rezone the former site of the Korea Food Research Institute in Seongnam. The site was later developed into apartment complexes by a private developer, and allegations were raised that Lee rezoned the land to give preferential treatment to the company. In November, a lower court found him guilty of making false statements in violation of the Public Official Election Act and sentenced him to a suspended one-year prison term. hague@yna.co.kr(END)",(2nd LD) Prosecutors demand 2-yr prison term for opposition leader in election law violation case,Chang Dong-woo,Yonhap News Agency,2025-02-26T19:54:54,2025-02-26T19:54:54,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-843841,"Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said that Israel was looking to US President Donald Trump to pressure Iran into ending its efforts to gain nuclear weapons, warning that a “military option” may still be required, in an interview with Politico published on Wednesday. Sa’ar warned that time was running out to prevent Tehran from accessing nuclear weapons, and the Islamic regime had already enriched uranium capable of producing a “couple of bombs.” If efforts to stop the regime do not succeed, it would trigger a “nuclear race in the Middle East with Egypt, Saudis, Turkey,” he said. A quarterly UN nuclear watchdog report showed on Wednesday that Iran’s stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% of weapons-grade, has jumped since Iran announced a dramatic acceleration in enrichment in December. Two quarterly reports sent by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) to member states showed that while the stock of 60% material has grown by around half, there has been no real progress on resolving long-running outstanding issues with Iran, including the unexplained presence of uranium traces found at undeclared sites. “The significantly increased production and accumulation of highly enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon state to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,” the IAEA said in a passage that, unusually, was included in both reports. The stock of uranium refined to up to 60% in the form of uranium hexafluoride grew by 92.5 kg. in the past quarter to 274.8 kg, one of two confidential IAEA reports said. That is enough, in principle, if enriched further, for six nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick. One of the reports also spelled out the lack of progress on the outstanding issues, such as explaining the uranium traces, which the IAEA has been asking the Islamic Republic to do for years. “Iran states that it has declared all of the nuclear material, activities, and locations required under its Safeguards Agreement. This is inconsistent with the agency’s assessments of the unexplained nuclear-related activities that took place at all four of the undeclared locations in Iran referred to above,” the report said. “The agency is, therefore, at an impasse with regard to resolving these outstanding safeguards issues.” Stressing the need to halt Tehran, which has issued multiple anti-America statements and threats to Israel, Sa’ar said the regime would destabilize the entire Middle East region. Sa’ar noted that Tehran had already dedicated a number of resources to destabilizing the region, noting Iran had already trafficked weapons and money into the West Bank. A diplomatic path is still being pursued, he said while emphasizing that he did not believe such efforts would be fruitful. “I think that in order to stop a nuclear Iranian program before it will be weaponized, a reliable military option should be on the table,” he said.","'Military option' on table to halt Tehran's nuclear threat, Sa'ar warns",JERUSALEM POST STAFF,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-26T12:18:10,2025-02-26T15:55:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250226006400315?section=national/diplomacy,"SEOUL, Feb. 26 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's top diplomat said Wednesday that confirming the captured North Korean soldiers' intentions is the key factor before allowing them to defect to the South, reaffirming Seoul's willingness to bring them here. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul made the remarks after a North Korean soldier held by Ukraine said in an interview with a South Korean daily last week that he wants to go to South Korea and that he was about ""80 percent sure"" of it. He was one of the two wounded North Korean soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces last month during combat in Russia's western Kursk border region. North Korea has sent around 11,000 troops in support of Moscow's war against Kyiv. ""If their intention to defect is clear, we must, of course, accept them as South Korean nationals and take necessary steps in accordance with the constitutional provisions,"" Cho said during a parliamentary session in response to a question by Rep. Kim Gi-hyeon of the ruling People Power Party. ""However, their personal intentions appear to be the most important factor,"" Cho said. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul speaks during a parliamentary session at the National Assembly in western Seoul on Feb. 26, 2025. (Yonhap) Cho said the government has been working to confirm their intentions through ""various contacts,"" without disclosing details. ""Since their decisions are not yet 100 percent certain, we believe it will gradually become clearer,"" he said. Following the media report, the foreign ministry said the government is willing to provide protection and support if the North Korean soldiers express a desire to come to the South, in line with the principles and relevant laws regarding all North Korean individuals as its own. On relations with the United States under the second Donald Trump administration, Cho reiterated the pledge to work with Washington in areas that strategically matter to both countries, including shipbuilding and artificial intelligence, to explore the potential for further economic cooperation.

https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-impossible-choice-which-industries-should-survive-the-green-transition/,"NEUSS, Germany — On the left bank of the Rhine, the European Union’s third-largest aluminum smelter sits idle. No smoke rises from its four spindly chimneys; the giant pots, once filled to the brim with molten silvery liquid, have long cooled. They won’t fire up again.  When the Rheinwerk plant stopped smelting in 2023, citing exorbitant energy prices, it sent shockwaves through a country haunted by the threat of deindustrialization. The shutdown meant job losses and ended a 60-year tradition in Neuss, a midsized German city halfway between Cologne and the Dutch border. But behind three silent production halls, the factory now hums with round-the-clock activity. Furnaces roar, shredders rumble and electric trucks zip around the foundry. The Rheinwerk is still producing aluminum ingots the length of a minibus.  There’s just one difference: These metal blocks are made from trash — making them less energy-intensive and more sustainable than the freshly smelted stuff, known as primary aluminum. “We’re building one recycling furnace after another,” said Volker Backs, managing director of Speira, the company running the Rheinwerk. “We take the green transition seriously here.” It wasn’t an easy decision, said Backs, but a necessary one — for both profit and planet. “We were of course sorry that we couldn’t maintain primary production of aluminum here,” he added, “but we see recycling as our future.”  One of the Rheinwerk’s giant furnaces is used for re-melting aluminium waste. | Zia Weise The same hard choice awaits companies and governments across the continent: Prop up products and practices that are no longer competitive, or abandon them. Complicating the matter are soaring costs, fierce competition from China and a looming trade war with the United States. 	 Companies need to decide whether to ditch or pour money into parts of their businesses whose green transition will cost billions. And governments need to decide how — and whom — they help. Do they bet on future-oriented enterprises or retain creaky industrial sites? Europe’s strained public purses won’t subsidize it all.  On Wednesday, the European Commission will offer an initial answer with its Clean Industrial Deal. The EU executive’s plan will propose much-needed measures to slash energy prices and stimulate investment. But it will sidestep the thorniest question: Which sectors and products can and should the EU save — and which should it let die? Brussels can’t avoid this question forever. The response will determine not only what the EU’s industry and job market look like in the coming decades but also the bloc’s autonomy: Where it gets the aluminum for its wind turbines, the cement for its buildings or the steel for its weapons.  “It’s something I don’t see enough in the discourse — a transition means you need to make choices, and those choices need to be strategic and explicit,” said Domien Vangenechten, who researches European industrial policy at environmental think tank E3G. “And you cannot save everyone.”  The choices facing Europe  Europe has to make those choices now.  Skyrocketing energy prices hammered the continent’s long-struggling manufacturing industry after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Some companies, notably in the steel sector, say irreversible decline can only be staved off with immediate political and financial support.  Backs recalls that as electricity costs quadrupled in 2022, the power price to produce one metric ton of primary aluminum suddenly hit more than €5,000 — double the metal’s price on the global market. “You don't have to think very long about whether it's still worth it,” he said.  The price shock came at the worst possible time.  One of Speira’s employees painted this mural in the Rheinwerk’s sorting hall. | Zia Weise Unlike previous industrial transformations, the green transition has a deadline thanks to planetary physics: The faster we stop pumping carbon dioxide into the air, the less severe climate change will be. Scientists say that zeroing out global net emissions by 2050 will prevent the worst, and the EU has enshrined this target date in law.  Energy-intensive manufacturing sectors — a category including steel, cement, aluminum, chemicals and more — account for more than a fifth of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, and their transition will be lengthy and expensive. They’ll have to change their production processes, use clean energy, source more recycled materials and capture the remaining CO2. As modernizing a factory takes years, companies need to know now what’s worth investing in. They want certainty about the conditions they’ll face and what support they’ll receive. The Commission’s Clean Industrial Deal seeks to address many of the manufacturers’ concerns, proposing made-in-EU quotas to stimulate demand and new measures to upgrade power grids and lower prices.  At the same time, the EU executive steers well clear of picking winners and losers in the green transition.  Yet there are urgent decisions to be made about which industries the EU wants to retain, and where it’s cheaper and more effective to rely on imports. Former European Central Bank leader Mario Draghi spelled it out in his sweeping report on boosting the bloc’s competitiveness. “There are some technologies, like solar panels, where foreign producers are too far ahead and attempting to capture production in Europe will only set back decarbonization,” he said in a speech presenting the report to the European Parliament last year.  But, he added, there are other sectors “where we do not want to be fully dependent on foreign technology for strategic reasons, and so it is key to keep the know-how in Europe.” Aluminum’s role Where on that divide primary aluminum production will land is an open question. The metal is in everything from soda cans and window frames to military aircraft and missiles. Demand is also expected to soar in the coming decades given the importance of the lightweight material for climate-friendly technologies like wind turbines and electric vehicles.  The EU has recognized its strategic role, adding aluminum to its critical raw materials list. NATO followed suit last year, warning that the alliance’s supply of the metal is at “very high risk” of disruption.  Yet manufacturing fresh aluminum requires more electricity than any other industrial production method — more than double the average German’s annual power consumption for each ton of metal. (At the Rheinwerk, a massive connection cable allowed the factory to use as much power as Neuss’ 150,000 inhabitants combined.) Once the EU’s power grids are fully decarbonized, this process could run on 100 percent green energy. Plus, once expensive fossil fuels are out of the system, power prices should go down.  Manufacturers can’t wait for that. EU companies pay two or three times as much for electricity as their Chinese and American rivals, and the 2022 price shock was the final straw for many.  Speira was only one of many smelters across Europe that curtailed operations during the energy crisis. Within two years, the continent’s primary aluminum production halved.  By contrast, Europe’s production of so-called secondary aluminum, manufactured using recycled metal, has steadily increased. Its advantages are obvious: Secondary production requires 95 percent less energy than primary production — making for a significantly lower carbon footprint. One ton of European-produced primary aluminum emits 6.7 tons of CO2 during manufacturing. That drops to as little as 0.5 tons for aluminum made entirely from remelted waste. And in theory, aluminum is infinitely recyclable.  That isn’t to say secondary aluminum producers don’t face challenges. Key EU aluminum buyers — such as carmakers — are in trouble, affecting short-term demand. The sector is also facing low-cost competition from China, which has accelerated aluminum production. Plus, U.S. President Donald Trump just announced 25 percent tariffs on aluminum, hitting EU companies’ exports.  But production costs, particularly for energy, are the top problem for European industry — and some argue the price of keeping primary production afloat just isn’t worth it.  Industry associations and trade unions, however, warn against abandoning domestic primary production.  For now, the EU cannot cover its demand with recycled aluminum alone, said Rob van Gils, president of Germany’s aluminum association. One day that might be possible, given all the metal in use. But while the average soda can ends up back at a recycling facility within a few months, the material in window frames or wind turbines won’t become scrap for decades.  Investments in recycling capacity “will pay off over time,” van Gils said. “But we still have to keep this primary process in Europe, because otherwise we will be completely dependent on imports.”  That’s bad for Europe’s self-sufficiency — and the planet: Primary aluminum produced outside of Europe tends to be far more carbon-intensive. Chinese aluminum spews around twice the emissions of EU-made metal. Brussels faces choice Whether it’s worth keeping primary aluminum production in the EU is ultimately a political choice of the sort Brussels is rather bad at.  The entrance to the Rheinwerk aluminium factory. | Zia Weise The Commission’s power to make strategic decisions about the future of industry is limited. And even where the EU executive can make decisions, it needs buy-in from a majority of national governments.   “Trying to come up with a holistic vision is challenging,” Vangenechten said. “Trying to come up with a holistic vision and get 27 member states to implement that and work together is even trickier.”  When the Commission suggested banning sales of new combustion-engine cars after 2035 — deciding to bet on electric vehicles for the future — a massive backlash followed.  Carmakers, fuel producers and engine-manufacturing countries successfully lobbied for a loophole for cars running on synthetic fuels, giving combustion technology another lease on life — even though such fuels are expected to be scarce, expensive and inefficient.  Since the 2035 debate, Brussels has faced calls to ensure “technological neutrality” in all its policymaking and let the market alone decide what’s viable.  But industry isn’t a monolith, and the Commission faces competing demands.  Clean technology manufacturers — which Brussels also wants to support with its Clean Industrial Deal — are pressuring the EU not to walk back its ambitions, warning that zig-zagging on already-passed climate legislation risks undermining the political predictability they need.  Or take recycling: The aluminum and steel sectors are asking the EU to restrict exports of scrap metal to ensure a steady supply of recycled material. But Europe’s recycling industry — which derives significant income from exports — warns that this would damage them.  Brussels won’t be able to make everyone happy. But the sooner it makes those decisions, the smoother the transition will be.  “The last thing we want is for a bunch of old manufacturing industries to just milk out their old assets and try to get as much revenue out of them [as possible] and then just close things down,” Vangenechten said. “That way we’re just extending the problem, and in 20 years’ time there will be zero jobs.”  The future of aluminum Back at the Rheinwerk, workforce levels are expected to return soon to 2023 numbers as the company adds more recycling capacity. The factory is unionized and workers’ representatives were involved in Speira’s plan to stop smelting.  While some European smelters are restarting primary production now that power prices have fallen to pre-crisis levels, there is no going back for Speira. The Rheinwerk is already producing as much aluminum from recycled cans as it used to smelt from scratch. Now, instead of power-intensive electrolysis, the Rheinwerk process starts with sorting through a sea of used drink cans.  In the sorting hall, Speira’s employees set up a cabinet of curiosities they find — coins, license plates, a disturbing amount of yellow Minion keychains, decommissioned military munitions — and decorated a wall with a painting of planet Earth, flanked by two cans.  “A colleague asked if he could paint that,” said Marcel Tappert, deputy head of the Rheinwerk’s recycling and casting operations. “The staff here are very much aware that they are part of the circular economy. You see what goes in, and what comes out is a new can from which you’ll drink your beer in the summer.”  After sorting, the cans are shredded, filtered for impurities, softened in huge ovens and sent for remelting. The last two stages run on fossil gas, though Speira has started mixing in oxygen to lower emissions. Eventually, Tappert said, the Rheinwerk furnaces could run on hydrogen. But that depends on sufficient investments in pipelines to transport the clean-burning gas. “If we relied on trucks, we’d have a truck coming in here every five minutes.”  Speira is prepared to achieve climate neutrality across its entire value chain by 2045, but the company can’t go it alone, Backs said. The EU and national governments have to ensure the necessary infrastructure gets built.  If decision-makers in Brussels and EU capitals don’t do their part, there won’t be any companies left to decarbonize, he warned: “Policies that protect only the climate and don’t future-proof the economy are pointless. What’s supposed to become climate-neutral if there is nothing left?” Lucia Mackenzie contributed to this story. ",Europe’s impossible choice: Which industries should survive the green transition?,Zia Weise,POLITICO,2025-02-26T03:26:00,2025-02-26T08:06:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rferl.org/a/kremlin-putin-trump-european-troops-ukraine/33327524.html,"The Kremlin has declined to confirm a statement by U.S. President Donald Trump saying Russia is ready to ""accept"" European troops in Ukraine as part of a peace deal, although it left room for a potential agreement. Trump made his comments after meeting French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at the White House, responding to a question about a deployment. ""I have specifically asked [Russian President Vladimir Putin] that question. He has no problem with it,"" Trump said on February 24. This led to a question at a regular media briefing held by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov in Moscow on February 25. His answer? There was, he said, ""nothing to add"" to an earlier statement that the deployment of peacekeepers from NATO countries in Ukraine was unacceptable to Moscow. ""There is a position on this matter that was expressed by the Russian foreign minister, [Sergei] Lavrov. I have nothing to add to this,"" Peskov said. While this appears to cast doubt on Trump's comments, it also does not directly contradict it. A mission led by European NATO countries is not the same as an international contingent of peacekeepers from around the world that includes European forces. All sides have said talks are at an early stage, and Peskov may have been aiming for deliberate ambiguity. He may also have been saving this as something that can be presented later as a Russian concession, to be sold at the highest possible price. In any case, an idea that gained little traction when Macron first proposed it a year ago is now being discussed in earnest. Military Considerations Nicu Popescu, at the European Council on Foreign Relations, raises the distinction between a peacekeeping force and what has been called a ""reassurance force"" designed to fight if Ukraine is attacked again. ""The problem with traditional peacekeeping missions is that they are bound by UN decisions, meaning Russia could veto it or terminate the mission at any time,"" Popescu, who was Moldovan foreign minister from 2021 to 2024, told RFE last month. Jamie Shea, who served in various senior NATO roles before retiring in 2018, agrees and raises two further issues. ""Do we use NATO forces currently defending NATO borders in Central and Eastern Europe? Poland is opposed to this. And do we focus more on building up the Ukrainian Army as the main deterrent force and spend our money on this rather than on the European reassurance force (as Denmark is advocating)?"" he asked. We could learn more when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets with Trump in Washington on February 26. Starmer has said Britain would be willing to put boots on the ground in a mission with a U.S. ""backstop"" such as air power. ""Europeans will be mindful of the Bosnian fiasco of the early 1990s when the Europeans were on the ground and being criticized all the time by the Americans who were safely in the air,"" said Shea, who became prominent as NATO spokesman during the 1990s Balkan wars. Starmer's remarks on being willing to send troops grabbed headlines, but so did serious voices pointing out that Britain's military capabilities are limited. Chief among them was Richard Dannatt, the former head of the British Army, who said it was ""so run down"" it could not lead the mission. Britain's military has been largely focused on anti-terror and counterinsurgency operations since the September 11 attacks in the United States. It has been through cuts in the last decade and a parliamentary report in September 2024 titled Ukraine: A Wakeup Call said Britain was ""underprepared"" to counter the Russian threat. In July, Starmer himself said that Britain's armed forces were ""hollowed out."" Political Factors Europe's other military big-hitter is France. The French Army has greater numbers than the British but has also been stretched by years-long combat deployments across Africa. French experts have voiced doubts about its capacity for a higher-intensity conflict such as Ukraine. ""We only have six long-range rocket launchers left; we do not have any real means of combating drones,"" noted Leo Peria Peigne from the French Institute of International Relations in November. Sweden and the Netherlands indicated they could be willing to provide troops under certain conditions. But Poland, which has a large army, said it would not. Germany is currently going through a political transition following elections at the weekend. Both outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his likely successor, election winner Friedrich Merz, have been lukewarm on sending German troops. But neither has ruled it out, and there have been signals from within both men's parties that things may change. Once again, it's early days. Another key component from Europe could come from some Nordic and Baltic nations, which have been bullish in their support of Ukraine. Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden issued a joint statement on February 24 marking the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine promising large and ongoing military support. It did not mention sending troops, although Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen indicated she had an open mind on the matter. Political considerations also still weigh heavily. Polling in Western Europe has consistently shown low levels of support for sending troops to Ukraine. The risks of sending such a contingent even in a noncombat role would be enormous.

Pro-Ukrainian activists claim the barriers, which can close the harbor to marine drones, are the latest evidence that a long-mothballed submarine base, once known as Object 825 GTS, is being returned to service. ""The [Russian] occupiers are again using an old underground submarine base, which previously functioned as a museum, for military purposes,"" the Crimean Tatar guerilla group Atesh recently posted on Telegram. The group believes the anti-drone barriers indicate the submarine base is being used for military purposes since no other sensitive facilities currently exist in the bay. Balaklava harbor was demilitarized by Ukraine in 2008, then had extensive marina facilities for pleasure craft built beginning in 2016 while under Russian control. The Balaklava submarine base was completed in 1961 when Crimea was a key Soviet naval hub. Balaklava's unique landscape allowed Soviet planners to tunnel straight from the sea some 600 meters through a mountain bulky enough to protect people and vessels inside from a direct nuclear strike. The secret facility contained shelter for up to nine submarines and their crews, as well as a dry dock in which vessels could be repaired and chambers where nuclear weapons could be stored and prepared for deployment. Secrecy around the Soviet base led to Balaklava's harbor becoming a ""closed"" area in which only those with special permits were able to enter. During the Cold War, submarines slipped in and out of the underground base only under the cover of darkness. After the breakup of the Soviet Union the base came under Ukrainian control but was left unguarded. A visitor in 1994 recalled entering the once-secret site that appeared as if ""it had been abandoned as a result of some sudden catastrophe,"" adding, ""Chernobyl involuntarily comes to mind."" Much of the interior was stripped by thieves in the 1990s before Ukraine reopened the facility as a museum in 2003. After the annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia in 2014, the base came under Russian control but continued operation as a museum. Recent reports that the base is being returned to military use is only the latest such claim. In October 2022, the Ukrainian Army pointed to apparent construction taking place near an entrance to the submarine base as evidence it was being returned to military duties. The museum, however, appears to remain open to the public. John C.K. Daly, a defense expert for The Jamestown Foundation, told RFE that if the facility is currently being used by the Russian Navy it would be for ships rather than submarines. ""Given size constraints of the Black Sea Fleet's Kilo-class submarines (their beam is too broad for Balaklava's current configuration), its use at present before renovation would necessarily be for surface ships."" With Russian naval ports being targeted by Ukraine's rapidly evolving marine drones, it is possible Russian ships are being sheltered in sections of the base, including vessels previously berthed at the nearby Sevastopol Naval Base, which has repeatedly been hit by Ukrainian sea drones and missiles. Daly says the rapidly evolving marine drone technology being deployed by Ukraine has been ""one of the most unexpected and significant developments"" of the Russian invasion.

https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-united-states-germany-merz-duda-trump-soldiers-nato-troops-defense-ukraine-war-russia/,"Polish President Andrzej Duda said Tuesday that if Germany doesn't want American troops on its soil, Poland would be happy to take them. Duda was responding to remarks by Germany’s election winner Friedrich Merz, who said that U.S. President Donald Trump doesn't care about Europe and that the continent urgently needs to strengthen its own defenses. “If Germany does not want American troops, does not want partnership with the United States, we will very willingly accept partnership with the United States,” the Polish president said in an interview with Polsat News.  “I am interested in transferring all the cooperation that Germany has with the United States to Poland. Very willingly,” Duda added. The Polish president was also skeptical about Merz's other suggestion that Europe might have to find a replacement for NATO. “NATO without the United States? ... Everything is possible, but what's the point? If there is a security alliance without the United States, then its guarantees without the world's strongest power would simply be illusory,” Duda said.  “A reliable ally is, above all, the United States, which has repeatedly shown over the last hundred years that when they return to the game, they are able to interrupt any armed conflict, to end it. We saw this during World War I, we saw this during World War II, right here in Europe,” the president said.  Under the Polish political system, the government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk — a Duda opponent — takes the lead in foreign and military policy. Tusk is also strongly pro-American, but has been taking the lead in meetings of European leaders to figure out the continent's security policy in light of what is happening in the United States. Duda has reached out to Trump, traveling to the U.S. over the weekend to the conservative CPAC conference, where he met briefly with the U.S. president. In the interview, Duda said he's not afraid that Trump would “sell Ukraine"" — a reaction to the U.S. president's closer ties with Russia's Vladimir Putin and sharp denunciations of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump is also demanding a minerals deal with Ukraine to repay what he incorrectly says was $500 billion in U.S. aid for Kyiv.  “America has invested a huge amount of money in Ukraine,"" Duda said, adding: ""He has the right to expect that the U.S. will get something out of it. In this sense, Donald Trump is more concerned about Ukraine not being sold into Russian hands,” Duda says.","Poland is ready to host US troops if Germany doesn’t want them, president says",Csongor Körömi,POLITICO,2025-02-25T14:35:50,2025-02-25T14:37:58,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.dw.com/en/venezuela-iran-forge-anti-western-partnership-of-necessity/a-71735747,"In February, two planes operated by the Venezuelan airline Conviasa left the Mexican city of El Paso for Venezuela. On board were Venezuelan migrants, including members of the criminal gang Tren de Agua. These flights were the result of earlier talks between US special envoy Richard Grenell and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Following their meeting in Caracas, Grenell returned to the US with six imprisoned American citizens. This meeting highlights one aspect in particular: The US and Venezuela are once again talking to each other. In Iran, however, the situation is somewhat different. As of now, US President Donald Trump has not sent a representative to Tehran. Currently, contact with the Iranian government is mainly based on political pressure. In February, Trump signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum to restore maximum pressure on the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, denying Iran all paths to a nuclear weapon, and countering Iran's malign influence abroad. Accordingto the White House, Iran's terrorist network should be neutralized and Iran's aggressive development of missiles, as well as other asymmetric and conventional weapons capabilities, should be countered. Following the announcements, the Iranian Foreign Minister expressed his willingness to talk. ""It is not difficult to reach practical assurances that Iran will not have nuclear weapons, provided that objective guarantees are also provided that hostile measures against Iran — including economic pressures and sanctions — will be effectively terminated,"" Abbas Araghchi stated on X. The question now remains as to how the Trump government's decisive course towards Venezuela and Iran will affect the relationship between the two countries. Until now, they had fostered close political ties and collaborated closely on economic matters. Last November, the excellent connection between the two countries went so far that the government in Caracas offered asylum to the political leadership in Tehran in the event of a coup in Iran. It seems that these plans are well advanced: According to the Chilean newspaper La Tercera, members of the Iranian leadership have already acquired real estate in Venezuela. Both countries face high economic pressure, largely due to severe Western sanctions, particularly from the US, the European Union and several Western countries, including the UK and Canada. These sanctions are justified on the grounds of human and civil rights violations, in Venezuela as well as in Iran. Iran is also sanctioned because of its nuclear program. In addition, both countries are very isolated in their respective regions. ""Iran lacks an allied government in the Middle East, and relies on non-state actors such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shiite militias in Iran and the Houthi militia in Yemen,"" Sara Bazoobandi of the Institute for Security Policy at the University of Kiel told DW. ""However, since the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, their significance has dwindled massively,"" she added. ""The situation is similar in Venezuela,"" Sabine Kurtenbach, Interim President of the German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA) in Hamburg, told DW. ""In the end, the country only has backing in Latin America from Nicaragua, Cuba and parts of the opposition in Bolivia,"" she said. This is why cooperation between the two countries makes economic sense, Kurtenbach added. ""Both are interested in circumventing the sanctions as far as possible, or at least mitigating their effects,"" she said. Iran exports refined oil products to Venezuela, as Venezuelan crude oil often cannot be processed due to a lack of infrastructure. Iran also supports Venezuela in building refineries, infrastructure and industry. According to La Tercera, weapons such as drones also find their way from Iran to Venezuela. For its part, Venezuela supplies Iran with crude oil and petroleum products as well as agricultural products such as coffee, cocoa and tropical fruit. The government in Caracas also pays for Iran's technical services with Venezuelan gold. ""The basis of the close relationship between the two states is also their ideological affinity,"" says Ibero-Americanist Sabine Kurtenbach. ""Both states are linked by their ideology of the so-called 'anti-imperialist struggle' against the US,"" she added. ""In Iran, it started with the revolution in 1979, in Venezuela with the beginning of the presidency of Hugo Chávez in 1999,"" she stated. In Kurtenbach's view, this has prompted Venezuela to present itself as a pioneer of a multipolar world order. ""The Maduro government is aiming for a constellation in which the US has less global power and less influence as only in such a constellation can the Maduro government survive in the long term."" As a result, verbal attacks on the US are part of Maduro's ideological inventory. Iran shares a common world view not only with Venezuela, but also with China, Russia and North Korea. ""This is based on the decline of the current liberal order and the decline of the global power of the West, led by the US,"" Sara Bazoobandi said, adding that ""the rhetoric cultivated by the country's leadership reflects this."" In November 2020, shortly after the US presidential elections at the time Iran's religious and political leader Ali Khamenei said that ""no matter who comes to power in the US, their policy towards Iran is the same: Hostility, arrogance, hypocrisy. They are the true face of evil."" ""Accordingly, Iran shares Venezuela's ambitions"" Sara Bazoobandi told DW. ""These countries trust each other and their actual cooperation is based on trust,"" she said. And yet, it remains to be seen how the relationship between the two countries will develop in light of the Trump administration. ""Iran's strategic course is at a turning point,"" Sara Bazoobandi highlights. Trump wants Tehran to give up its nuclear ambitions. Otherwise, the risk of a military strike by Israel against the nuclear facility increases. ""If Iran accepts this condition, sanctions are likely to be eased, opening up more opportunities for Iran to reintegrate into the global economy,"" she said, adding that ""in this case, Venezuela might not be an attractive partner."" However, if Iran decides to reject the US condition and continue its nuclear program, countries like Venezuela could become more economically important for Iran, according to Bazoobandi. Sabine Kurzenbach takes a similar view. ""If the US were to cooperate with Venezuelan oil production in the future, that would certainly be interesting for the Maduro government,"" she said.

<p>The Rwanda-backed M23 has in recent weeks seized two major cities in the region, giving the armed group a major foothold since taking up arms again in late 2021.<>
<p>According to UN experts, the M23 is supported by around 4,000 Rwandan soldiers.<>
<p>According to DR Congo Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka, more than 7,000 people have been killed in the region since January. The numbers could not be independently verified.<>

<p>As a result of the M23 offensive, the UK government said that it was suspending most direct bilateral aid to Rwanda.<>
<p>""Rwanda may have security concerns but it is unacceptable to resolve these militarily,"" a government spokesperson said, adding that the aid would be suspended ""until significant progress"" was made in reducing the fighting.<>

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0de4wpvlo,"A dramatic day of high stakes diplomacy at the United Nations has exposed growing cracks in the transatlantic alliance since President Donald Trump returned to the global stage and massively shifted US foreign policy. When Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, Europe had no stronger partner than the United States. But this week, in the halls of the General Assembly and at the Security Council, the US worked against its closest allies and sided with Russia, Belarus and North Korea to pass resolutions on the conflict in Ukraine. To mark the third anniversary of Moscow's invasion, Ukraine sought a symbolic General Assembly resolution that would require the 193-member body to reaffirm Kyiv's territorial integrity and call for Russia to withdraw its forces in line with the UN charter. That resolution did pass on Monday, but with less support than in past years. Many members abstained to avoid a tricky tension created by the US. Washington's diplomats had urged other countries to vote against the measure and to instead support their ""forward looking resolution"" that was only three short paragraphs. It took a neutral stance on the war, without blaming Russia, and called for a swift end with a lasting peace to follow. Washington not only introduced their measure in the General Assembly where every nation's vote is equal, but also in the more powerful Security Council. Resolutions there are legally binding - though sometimes hard to enforce - and there had never been council action on Ukraine because of Russia's veto power as a permanent member. The move caught Europe off guard. One European diplomat told the BBC that the US behaved like a bully and did not take into account their stance on their continent's security. Another who sits on the Security Council, Slovenia's ambassador Samuel Zbogar, told the BBC that Europe is struggling to adjust to the 180-degree change in the US position - and the speed at which Washington is moving. He said the European Union will need to do some reflecting at the body's council meeting next week. ""Leaders will have to develop a plan on how the EU can actively be involved in finding peace, rather than reacting to what others are doing. It's up to us now in Europe to come forward,"" he told the BBC. There were plenty of reactions in the halls of UN headquarters in New York, as European leaders worked to reconcile with the latest US position. The UK's ambassador, Dame Barbara Woodward, and French UN Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere attempted to have the Security Council vote postponed, arguing that council members needed more time to consider the text and negotiate. Interestingly, the Chinese were willing to give more time for discussions, but the US and Russia, who are usually on opposite sides of issues on the council, both were against postponement. European members of the council then tried to introduce amendments, as they had successfully done earlier in the General Assembly resolution which led to the US abstaining on its own resolution. In the Security Council, the US threatened to block the proposed amendments to name Russia as the aggressor, reaffirm Ukraine's borders and call for a just peace. They said that it detracted from what Washington was trying to achieve and pursued a war of words rather than an end to the conflict. In the end, the US didn't have to use its veto because Russia voted to block the amended language. The US's neutral resolution then ultimately passed, breaking through three years of Security Council paralysis on the topic of Ukraine because of Russia's veto power. Just months ago, it would have seemed unthinkable that the first resolution adopted regarding the conflict would be one with such limited language - let alone that a resolution like this would be proposed by the US, condoned by Russia and passed without the full support of Europe's five council members. But the US hailed the development, the first action by the council to call for an end to the war. Others were not so celebratory. Richard Gowan, UN Director of the Crisis Group, said after three years of deepening animosity between Russia and the US at the UN, the sight of the two powers coordinating to embarrass Europe was pretty stunning. He said while everyone expected President Trump to be disruptive at the UN, this went beyond most people's expectations. ""The US lobbying against the European-Ukrainian resolution was very crude. US officials were reportedly threatening to cut aid to non-compliant states. This has left a nasty taste among many UN members,"" Mr Gowan said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv4m4npnedo,"Syria's interim president has told a national dialogue conference that the country has a ""historic"" opportunity to rebuild after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. Ahmed al-Sharaa also stressed the need for armed groups to integrate into the military and for the state to have a monopoly on weapons, saying Syria's ""strength lies in its unity"". The 600 delegates have been asked to provide recommendations on transitional justice, the economy, the new constitution and other topics to guide a new transitional government. But there has been criticism that the process has been rushed, and the Kurdish-led militia alliance and autonomous administration which control north-eastern Syria were not invited. The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years with an iron fist, with Bashar becoming president in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez. In 2011, Bashar brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes. On 8 December, he fled to Russia after a rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept down from north-western Syria and entered Damascus in the space of only 12 days. Seven weeks later, Sharaa was named president for the ""transitional period"" by his fellow rebel commanders. They also announced the cancellation of the 2012 constitution, the dissolution of the parliament, army and security agencies, and the integration of all rebel groups into the new state institutions replacing them. Sharaa promised to hold a national dialogue conference to discuss Syria's future, which he said would be followed by a ""constitutional declaration"" to serve during the transition. ""Syria liberated itself on its own, and it suits it to build itself on its own,"" Sharaa said in a speech at the national dialogue conference in Damascus on Tuesday. ""What we are living today is an exceptional, historic and rare opportunity. We must take advantage of every moment of it to serve the interests of our people and our country."" The organising committee said six working groups would be formed to discuss a transitional justice system, the new constitution, reforming and building state institutions, personal freedoms, the role of civil society, and the country's future economic model. The groups would agree non-binding recommendations, which would be presented to the new transitional government set to take power on Saturday and help shape the constitutional declaration, according to the committee. Sharaa said a transitional justice body would soon be formed to ""restore people's rights"" and start holding to account those who committed crimes against Syrians during the civil war. He also reiterated that non-state armed groups had to disarm and hand over their territory. ""The unity of arms and their monopoly by the state is not a luxury but a duty and an obligation,"" he said. ""Syria is indivisible; it is a complete whole, and its strength lies in its unity."" The interim government's forces control Syria's biggest cities, but large parts of the country are still held by various armed groups. They include the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia alliance supported by the US, which controls most of the north-east and serves as the armed forces of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES). The SDF has so far refused to integrate its forces into the new Syrian army, although negotiations have been taking place in recent weeks. Organisers of the conference said the SDF and AANES had not been invited because of that refusal, and that Kurds would be represented in Damascus even if they were not. However, SDF spokesman Farhad Shami told AFP news agency that ""the exclusion of the SDF and large sections of Syrian society confirm that the conference serves to please the outside world and not to seek a better future"". Thirty-five parties in the AANES also criticised what they claimed was the ""token representation"" of Kurds and other minorities, saying such events were ""meaningless, worthless, and will not contribute to finding real solutions to the country's ongoing crisis"". Moutasem Sioufi of The Day After, an independent civil society group that is participating in the conference, told the BBC that it was important that all groups were involved. ""We need to have dialogue with all the Syrian groups, with all Syrian powers, especially those who have great influence on the ground. Without that Syria would face a very hard time maintaining itself together,"" he said. The outcomes of the conference will be closely watched by the international community, which has called for an inclusive political process that represents the country's many ethnic and religious communities. During the civil war, the US, the UK, and the European Union imposed a wide range of sanctions on Syria targeting Assad's government and its allies in response to atrocities committed during the civil war. They have lifted some of the sanctions that crippled the Syrian economy since Assad's fall, but made further steps dependent on Syria's new leaders keeping promises to respect minority rights and move towards democracy. On Monday, the EU announced that it was suspending sanctions on its energy, transport and banking sectors to facilitate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani welcomed that decision, but he criticised the international sanctions still in place in a speech to the national dialogue conference. ""These sanctions are illegitimate and are not based on any legal or moral foundations,"" he said. ""They are being used as a means of pressure on the will of the Syrian people."" HTS, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, is subject to separate sanctions because it continues to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK. The sectarian violence involving Islamist factions, security forces and Druze gunmen is another sign of the fragile security situation. The strikes were south of Damascus, where Syrian security forces say they are battling gunmen from the religious minority. Ghayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election. Restrictions are also being eased on the financial services and energy sectors to help investment. There are concerns around what democracy could look like and the role of Islam in the new regime.

https://apnews.com/article/chile-blackout-power-outage-south-america-failure-electricity-8224a4cbcfc98c4f17e7d1e3b00936b5,"SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Electricity providers across Chile scrambled to restore service Tuesday after a sweeping blackout plunged 90% of the country into darkness, stranding commuters, knocking cell service offline and paralyzing businesses and daily life. The scale of the power outage appeared to take authorities off guard. The government declared a state of emergency alongside a mandatory nighttime curfew that will last until 6 a.m. Wednesday. “Our first concern, and the reason for this announcement, is to ensure people’s safety,” Interior Minister Carolina Tohá said in announcing the exceptional measures. The ministry deployed thousands of soldiers across the country to help maintain order and enforce the curfew. Mobile phone services blinkered offline. The world’s largest copper mine suspended operations. People complained of water shortages as pumps running on electricity stopped working. Emergency generators helped hospitals and government offices continue operating. But the lights — and, on a hot summer night in the Southern Hemisphere, the air conditioning and fans that keep people cool — began to return in spurts seven hours after the electric failure first struck. Cheers rung out on the streets where lights flickered back on. At around 11 p.m., power was restored to around half of the 8 million affected households, said President Gabriel Boric. “What happened today is outrageous,” Boric said in a late-night televised address. “It’s unacceptable that one or several companies impact the everyday life of millions of Chileans.” The National Electrical Coordinator, Chile’s grid operator, said a disruption had occurred in a high-voltage backbone transmission line that carries power from the Atacama Desert of northern Chile to the capital of Santiago in the country’s central valley. The operator’s president, Juan Carlos Olmedo, said that the regional problem started a long-distance chain reaction of overloads and plant shutdowns until it became a giant blackout that hit 90% of Chile’s 19 million people, from the northernmost Chilean port of Arica to the southern Los Lagos agricultural region. “The electric system did not operate the way it should have,” he said. The specific cause of the failure remains under investigation. Officials have ruled out a cyberattack or any kind of criminal activity. All over Chile, traffic lights darkened, trains stopped and ATMs shut down. Soccer matches were called off, classes were canceled and concerts postponed. Police officers and civilians worked together to direct traffic. Petrol stations were left unable to pump. Businesses, from restaurants and bars to movie theaters, lost money. Frantic crowds became stranded in stalled subway cars. Older adults fretted they would not be able to leave apartment buildings because elevators were out of order. “Everything has stopped, there’s chaos,” said Jorge Calderón, a writer and resident of Santiago. Chile’s national disaster response service, Senapred, said the disruption in the power supply caused an outage across 14 of the country’s 16 regions, including Santiago, a city of some 8.4 million people, where authorities said there would be no subway service until further notice. Tohá said hospitals, prisons and government buildings were using backup generators to keep essential equipment operating. Officials evacuated passengers from darkened tunnels and subway stations in Santiago and elsewhere in the country, including the coastal tourist hotspot of Valparaiso. Videos on social media shared from across Chile, a long ribbon of a country stretching 4,300 kilometers (over 2,600 miles) along the southern Pacific coast, showed mass confusion at intersections as traffic lights failed, people having to use their mobile phones as torches in the underground metro and police dispatched to help evacuate buildings. Transport Minister Juan Carlos Muñoz urged people to stay home, saying it’s “not a good time to go out since we have a transport system that is not operating normally” with just a fraction of the traffic lights functioning nationwide. Authorities at Santiago International Airport said terminals had switched to emergency power but warned that “some flights could be impacted.” Some copper mines in the Andean nation shut down for lack of electricity while others used auxiliary power to continue operations. The world’s biggest copper producer, state-owned mining company Codelco, said the power outage had “affected all operations,” without elaborating. ___ Batschke reported from Sao Paulo.

https://www.latintimes.com/chapitos-leader-ivan-archivaldo-guzman-reportedly-managed-escape-ambush-through-tunnel-576600,"It has been a turbulent few days for residents of Culiacán as government officials and law enforcement agencies continue to look for Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, one of Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán's sons and the alleged leader of ""Los Chapitos,"" a faction of the Sinaloa Cartel. Secret operations in the state last week led to the arrest of four high-profile members of the criminal organization, including the security chief of Iván Archivaldo Guzmán and his financial operator. Among those arrested by members of the Mexican Army and the National Guard were José Ángel Canobbio Inzunza, alias ""El Güerito,"" Kevin Alonso Gil Acosta, a.k.a. ""El 200,"" José Alonso Acosta López ""El Gusi,"" and Gustavo Acosta López. Authorities detailed that ""El 200"" served as the security chief for Los Chapitos before his arrest, while El Güerito served as the financial mastermind behind the organization's fentanyl distribution. But according tolocal reports, operations were also meant to arrest Archivaldo Guzmán, who allegedly managed to escape via a tunnel, just like his father did during his second escape from a maximum security prison in 2015. According to the journalist José Luis Montenegro, who claims to have sources inside the Los Chapitos camp, Archivaldo Guzmán was at a home in the Tierra Blanca neighborhood when the operations took place. He detailed that the property counts with an underground tunnel, which Iván Archivaldo allegedly used to get away. ""According to my sources, he escaped just like his father did in order to avoid being captured,"" Montenegro said in an interview. He added that Archivaldo Guzmán was with Eric Bastidas, alias ""El 09,"" at the moment of his escape, a close confidant and ally of his. Although he managed to escape, reports suggest the leader of Los Chapitos suffered an injury. It was not confirmed if it was a gunshot wound as authorities did not report any violent clashes during the operations. Mexican authorities have not released any official information about the incident, but according to a report by the outletAdiscusión, the clandestine tunnel was found by members of Mexico's Attorney General's Office between Feb. 21 and Feb. 23. The tunnel reportedly has a length of more than 2,600 feet and connects the two properties through an exit built in the bathroom. While investigating the scene, authorities found shovels and buckets that were allegedly used for its construction as well as some ventilation devices, which facilitated air circulation throughout the slim tunnel. One of El Chapo's sons, Archivaldo Guzmán was born on August 15, 1983 in Culiacán, Sinaloa. Due to his prominent role in the cartel, the U.S. Department of State is offering a reward up to $10 million for information leading to his arrest. According to U.S. authorities, Archivaldo alongside his brother Jesús Alfredo and his half-brothers Ovidio and Joaquín Guzmán López formed the criminal group known as Los Chapitos, who is largely responsible for the massive influx of fentanyl into the U.S. over the past several years. All four brothers have been indicted across several judicial districts over the years for major violations of U.S. drug laws. © 2025 Latin Times. All rights reserved.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250225001155315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, Feb. 25 (Yonhap) -- Impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol said Tuesday he will focus on revising the Constitution if reinstated, suggesting he could step down before the end of his single, five-year term. Yoon made the remark in his final statement before the Constitutional Court, which is expected to deliver a ruling by mid-March on whether to uphold or dismiss his impeachment over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December. ""I will gather the will of the people and swiftly push for a constitutional amendment, doing my best to produce a Constitution and political structure that fit the changes in our society,"" he said during the final hearing of his impeachment trial at the court. ""If a constitutional amendment and political reform are pursued correctly, I believe the separated and divided people will unite in the process,"" he said. ""If that happens, there will be no reason to cling to the remainder of my term as guaranteed under the Constitution, and if anything, it will be a great honor,"" he added. South Korea's Constitution limits presidents to a single, five-year term, but Yoon's remark suggests he could accept calls to change the limit to two four-year terms and apply the rule to himself. Yoon also said he plans to focus on foreign relations based on his experience of strengthening the South Korea-U.S. alliance and establishing trilateral cooperation among South Korea, the United States and Japan, while shifting authority over domestic issues to the prime minister. In his 67-minute statement, Yoon repeatedly denied the charges of insurrection leveled at him over his surprise declaration of martial law Dec. 3, citing what he described as a small number of troops that entered the National Assembly compound that night and the short amount of time -- two hours -- they were deployed there. He also dismissed as ""absurd"" claims that he ordered the arrest of politicians or the removal of lawmakers from the National Assembly building. Still, he offered an apology to the nation for the ""confusion and inconvenience"" caused by his martial law bid. ""I want to first say that I am sorry and thankful to the people,"" he said. ""While feeling thankful, the reality of not being able to do my work in the time given to me by the people made me sorry and caused my heart to ache."" The National Assembly's impeachment motion against Yoon accuses the president of violating the Constitution and laws by declaring martial law in the absence of a national emergency and ignoring due procedures, such as holding a Cabinet meeting and notifying parliament. Yoon has argued his declaration of martial law was an act of governance meant to send a warning to the opposition party over its repeated impeachments of government officials and attempts to cut the government budget. Legal experts anticipate the court will deliver its verdict on whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate him within two weeks after Tuesday's hearing, citing the precedents of former Presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Park Geun-hye. If he is ousted, the country will be required to hold a snap presidential within 60 days. If reinstated, he will serve out the remainder of his term through May 2027. The court did not schedule a date for the verdict Tuesday. Earlier during the proceeding, the legal teams of both Yoon and the National Assembly, which is the prosecution in the case, delivered their final arguments. Yoon's team called for the dismissal of his impeachment, saying the opposition party's unilateral actions necessitated his short-lived imposition of martial law. ""The emergency martial law ended after two hours, and not a single citizen was injured in the process of declaring and lifting the decree,"" Chah Kee-whahn, one of the lawyers, said. Lee Dong-chan, another lawyer, said the opposition party's policy obstructions, railroading of legislation and unilateral cuts of the government budget were to blame for the president's action. ""It cannot be denied that the state created by the opposition party is a state of national emergency,"" he said. The National Assembly's legal team demanded the court uphold the impeachment and remove Yoon from office. ""It became clear through evidence examination during the impeachment trial and the related investigation that (Yoon) violated the Constitution and laws through a series of insurrection actions,"" Song Doo-hwan, one of the National Assembly's lawyers, said. ""It is hard to imagine a graver reason than the reasons of unconstitutionality and illegality in this case in the past or in the future,"" he said. Rep. Jung Chung-rai of the main opposition Democratic Party, the head of the Assembly's impeachment panel, also delivered his final statement before Yoon.

Authorities suspect theNortheast Cartel (CDN), a violent criminal group operating in northern Mexico, was responsible. Tamez García was reportedly driving a black Dodge Ram 1500 TRX to Monterrey to visit his family when he was abducted. He was allegedly intercepted on the Monterrey-Reynosa highway passing the San Juan Bridge–an area disputed by CDN and the Gulf Cartel. Tamez García was on a call with his family when armed men, allegedly posing as law enforcement, stopped him. Relatives alerted authorities after losing contact with him near a toll booth. His case is being widely discussed on social media, with some reports suggesting that his captors initially intended to steal his truck, and the situation escalated into a kidnapping. Leaked cartelaudio recordingscircling online suggest that a CDN leader, ""El Chamuko,"" ordered the abduction. Nuevo León authorities launched an operation, dismantling a cartel camp and engaging in armed clashes, with no success. As of Sunday evening, authorities have yet to locate Tamez García and his vehicle. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has designated the Northeast Cartel and five other Mexican cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, allowing for stronger sanctions and law enforcement actions. U.S. officials argue that these groups pose a national security threat, comparing them to al-Qaeda and ISIS. © 2025 Latin Times. All rights reserved.

Un tercer vuelo con 242 migrantes venezolanos, el primero con mujeres y niños, llegó a Caracas este lunes en un avión de la aerolínea estatal de Venezuela procedente de México, tras las conversaciones entre el gobierno de Nicolás Maduro y la administración del presidente Donald Trump. El ministro venezolano de Interior y Justicia, Diosdado Cabello, indicó que desconocen si el grupo fue enviado desde EEUU a territorio mexicano o si se encontraban ya allí. Precisó que está conformado por 94 hombres, 74 mujeres y 74 menores de edad, entre ellos una adolescente de 16 años sin acompañante. Cabello especificó que muchos de los menores llegaron sin ""ningún tipo de identificación"" venezolana porque nacieron en el exterior ""y no han sido registrados"" en el país, aseguró. Todos, agregó, serán sometidos a exámenes médicos y psicológicos. También recibirán los documentos de identidad que correspondan. El funcionario subrayó que todavía quedan muchos niños solos en el exterior y que sólo trajeron a una menor de edad sin representantes porque su padre aseguró que la buscaría en el aeropuerto. “Luego viene la revisión del expediente policial de cada uno de los adultos. Esto lo hacemos con una rigurosidad necesaria porque la primera información es que desde Estados Unidos venían delincuentes de todo tipo y cuando llegamos aquí la realidad no es esa, la realidad es que son una minoría”, dijo el ministro venezolano de Interior y Justicia antes de recibir a los recién llegados en el Aeropuerto Internacional Simón Bolívar. Cabello insistió en que ninguno de los venezolanos que han regresado tiene vínculos con la banda criminal Tren de Aragua, que el gobierno del país suramericano asegura haber desmantelado. De acuerdo con el ministro, es posible que esta semana llegue otro vuelo con repatriados. El 10 de febrero, fue trasladado a Venezuela un primer grupo de 190 migrantes irregulares venezolanos deportados desde Estados Unidos. El jueves de la semana pasada llegaron 177 migrantes venezolanos que estaban detenidos en la base naval de Guantánamo. En este caso, Cabello precisó que 8 de ellos están a la orden de la justicia por delitos “graves”, específicamente homicidio. Los vuelos de repatriación reiniciaron 10 días después de un encuentro en Caracas entre el gobernante Nicolás Maduro y Richard Grenell, enviado especial del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump. En esa reunión, según se anunció, Venezuela aceptó recibir a todos los inmigrantes irregulares venezolanos capturados en Estados Unidos.

https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-usmca-deal-tariff-deadline-monday-mananera-recap/,"United States President Donald Trump said Monday that his planned 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian exports to the U.S. “are going ahead on time, on schedule,” meaning the duties would take effect on March 4 at the conclusion of a one-month suspension. “This is an abuse that took place for many, many years,” Trump said in justification of the decision to impose tariffs on the United States’ neighbors and North American trade partners. “And I’m not even blaming the other countries that did this, I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen. I mean who can blame them if they made these great deals with the United States, took advantage of the United States on manufacturing, on just about everything,” he said at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. Earlier on Monday, President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed confidence that Mexico would in fact reach an agreement with the United States to stave off Trump’s proposed tariffs for a second time. At her morning press conference, Sheinbaum also spoke about the possibility of Mexico imposing additional tariffs on imports from countries with which it doesn’t have free trade agreements, most notably China. ‘If necessary,’ Sheinbaum will seek call with Trump Trump has said he plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for three reasons: On Monday, Sheinbaum reiterated Mexico’s commitment to “helping the United States” solve the “humanitarian crisis” caused by illicit fentanyl in the U.S. On actions to combat drug trafficking and other problems Mexico will need to reach “important agreements” with the United States this Friday, she said, noting that the tariffs are scheduled to take effect early next week. “If it is necessary I will be seeking another telephone call with President Trump — whatever is needed to reach an agreement,” Sheinbaum said. She noted that Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard traveled to Washington for tariff talks last week, and declared there is communication between Mexico and the United States “on all issues.” “What we need is to close this agreement” to ward off the tariffs,” said Sheinbaum, who earlier this month achieved a one-month pause on the proposed duties after agreeing to deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to Mexico’s northern border. “… I believe we’re in a position to do so,” she said. Ebrard has said that the United States would be shooting itself in the foot if it imposes a 25% tariff on Mexican exports, asserting that 400,000 jobs would be lost in the U.S. and prices would rise for U.S. consumers. He said earlier this month that 25% tariffs the United States intends to impose on all steel and aluminum imports are illogical and a “bad idea” with regard to Mexico, given that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Mexico on the trade of those metals. The steel and aluminum tariffs are scheduled to take effect on March 12. USMCA the priority, says Sheinbaum, and therefore additional tariffs on China are an option
Sheinbaum noted that an Economy Ministry team is still in Washington as Mexico seeks to reach a new deal to stop Trump’s proposed tariffs taking effect next week. “What we’ve established — I’ve said it from the beginning — is that the relationship and trade agreement with the United States has to be prioritized,” she said. “And we ask the United States to prioritize its trade agreement with Mexico and Canada,” Sheinbaum said. She said that imposing tariffs on imports from countries with which Mexico doesn’t have free trade agreements, such as China, is an option. “[Former] president López Obrador even did it, he put tariffs on countries with which we don’t have trade agreements,” said Sheinbaum, whose administration recently imposed tariffs on Chinese clothing and textiles. “… With China, for example, we don’t have a trade agreement. … So it’s part of what this [Economy Ministry] group is working on,” she said, alluding to additional tariffs on Chinese exports to Mexico. Bloomberg, citing “people familiar with the matter,” reported on Saturday that “the Trump administration told Mexican officials” including Minister Ebrard “that they should put their own duties on Chinese imports as part of their efforts to avoid tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.” However, Sheinbaum said that the implementation of tariffs on Chinese exports to Mexico wasn’t a “condition” that had been set by the United States. “The issue is to reach an agreement that allows us … to guarantee that there are no tariffs between our countries [and] that the trade agreement continues,” she said. “… [We have to] give priority to this trade agreement and see how the three [USMCA] countries can strengthen ourselves compared to other regions of the world,” Sheinbaum said. “… In that sense, we’re not suggesting [tariffs] in particular on China, but rather on those countries with which we don’t have trade agreements,” she said. “It’s something that I even put forward in the conversation I had with the president of China at the G20 [Summit in Brazil]. Of course with China there is a cultural relationship, … and [a relationship spanning] many other issues. On the issue of trade I told [President Xi Jinping] that we have the trade agreement with the United States and that is one of our priorities,” Sheinbaum said.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250225001100315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, Feb. 25 (Yonhap) -- The Constitutional Court is set to hold the final hearing of President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment trial Tuesday as attention focuses on how the president will defend his short-lived imposition of martial law. The hearing will open at 2 p.m. and begin with an examination of evidence and the final arguments of the legal teams of both Yoon and the National Assembly, which is the prosecution in the case. Yoon and Rep. Jung Chung-rai of the main opposition Democratic Party, the head of the Assembly's impeachment panel, will then be given unlimited time to present their final arguments. The president is expected to use his statement to explain the circumstances that led to his surprise declaration of martial law Dec. 3 and assert the illegality of his investigation by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) and the prosecution. Also in focus is whether the president will issue an apology to the nation for the political turmoil caused by his martial law declaration and subsequent impeachment. Jung has said he will use his final arguments to explain why Yoon should be removed from office, how his claims are different from the truth and how the nation should overcome the current crisis. The National Assembly's impeachment motion against Yoon accuses the president of violating the Constitution and laws by declaring martial law in the absence of a national emergency and ignoring due procedures, such as holding a Cabinet meeting and notifying parliament. Yoon has argued his declaration of martial law was an act of governance meant to send a warning to the opposition party over its repeated impeachments of government officials and attempts to cut the government budget. Legal experts anticipate the court will deliver its verdict on whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate him within two weeks after Tuesday's hearing, citing the precedents of former Presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Park Geun-hye. hague@yna.co.kr(END)",Court set to hold final hearing of Yoon's impeachment trial,Lee Haye-ah,Yonhap News Agency,2025-02-25T08:12:25,2025-02-25T09:25:22,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/morocco-says-it-foiled-major-islamic-state-plot/,"Moroccan authorities say they arrested a dozen people this month allegedly planning attacks on behalf of the Islamic State in the Sahel, a region south of the Sahara Desert. The discovery of the terrorist cell and what authorities called an “imminent dangerous terrorist plot” reflect the expanding ambitions of extremist groups in the region. Authorities do not provide details of the suspects’ motives or their plot, beyond saying they planned to set off bombs remotely. They release photographs and videos showing officers raiding terrorist cells throughout the country. The images show weapons stockpiles found during police raids, Islamic State flags drawn on walls, and thousands of dollars of cash. The revelation of the plot comes days after Morocco hosted Israeli Transportation Minister Miri Regev for a traffic safety conference. Regev cut her visit short last week after bombs exploded on empty buses near Tel Aviv Thursday. “Morocco remains a major target in the agenda of all terrorist organizations operating in the Sahel,” Habboub Cherkaoui, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations, says at a news conference. Authorities say the Morocco-based cell called itself “the Lions of the Caliphate in the Maghreb” and took direction from Islamic State in the Sahel commanders. The weapons found include materials to make explosives including nail bombs, dynamite and gas cylinders as well as knives, rifles and handguns whose serial numbers had been filed off. Investigators say the 12 men arrested ranged from 18 to 40 years old and were apprehended in nine different cities, including Casablanca, Fez and Tangier. The majority were unmarried and had not finished high school. They have not yet been charged under Morocco’s anti-terrorism laws. Based on materials gathered in raids last week, authorities were able to locate a cache of weapons in the desert near Morocco’s border with Algeria, including firearms and ammunition wrapped in newspapers printed in Mali in late January.",Morocco says it foiled major Islamic State plot,AP,The Times of Israel,2025-02-24T22:34:49,2025-02-24T22:34:49,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.timesofisrael.com/senior-hamas-official-i-wouldnt-have-backed-oct-7-if-id-known-outcome-for-gaza/,"Senior Hamas politburo member Moussa Abu Marzouk said he would not have backed the October 7, 2023, invasion and onslaught in southern Israel if he had known what the consequences would be for the Gaza Strip, in an interview with The New York Times that was conducted on Friday and published on Monday. The October 7 attack — in which thousands of Hamas-led terrorists burst across the Gaza-Israel border, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages, amid rampant acts of brutality and sexual assault — sparked the subsequent war in Gaza, which has devastated the enclave, seen tens of thousands killed, and prompted the US president to call for the forced relocation of the more than 2 million residents of the Strip. The war has also, through fighting on other fronts, significantly weakened Iran’s so-called “Axis of Resistance,” devastating the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon, and indirectly contributing to the collapse of the Iran-backed Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. “If it was expected that what happened would happen, there wouldn’t have been October 7,” Abu Marzouk said, asserting that — though he claimed to not have been privy to the exact details of the planned assault — he could not have brought himself to approve it, knowing what he knows now. The statement of regret marked a departure from previous statements by Hamas officials. A few weeks after the invasion, for example, politburo member Ghazi Hamad publicly declared that October 7 was “just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth,” saying, “we are ready to pay” the price, and vowing to continue until Israel was totally annihilated. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories In the weeks since a hostage release-ceasefire deal was reached last month, Hamas and its allies have also repeatedly called the war a “victory” for their cause. Palestinians live among the rubble of their homes, which were destroyed in the war between Israel and Hamas, in the city of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on February 23, 2025. (Abed Rahim Khatib) Indeed, Abu Marzouk’s remarks were quickly countered by Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem, who said: “The occupation’s aggressive and destructive behavior is the cause of the destruction in Gaza. The October 7 epic marks a strategic turning point in the Palestinian national struggle.” In a statement issued a short while later by the group itself, Hamas claimed Abu Marzouk’s comments were “incorrect and taken out of context.” “The interview was conducted a few days ago and the published statements did not reflect the full content of the answers,” the terror group contended. In the interview, Abu Marzouk said Hamas’s survival, despite Israel’s campaign in Gaza, constituted a “kind of victory.” He compared the terror group, which has been the de facto government of Gaza since ousting the Palestinian Authority’s main Fatah faction in a 2007 coup, to a regular person who has survived a boxing match with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. But he said that in absolute terms, it would be “unacceptable” to call the war a win for the terror group. “We’re talking about a party [Israel] that lost control of itself and took revenge against everything,” Abu Marzouk claimed. “That is not a victory under any circumstances.” Abu Marzouk says open to talking disarmament In the interview, Abu Marzouk also said he was open to discussing the potential disarmament of the terror group in Gaza, saying that, “We are ready to speak about every issue,” and, “Any issue that is put on the table, we need to speak about it.” He declined, however, to answer specific questions about what a compromise on disarmament might look like. The comments seemed to contradict more hardline statements from other public leaders of late, such as politburo member Osama Hamdan, who said this month that “the weapons of the resistance” were non-negotiable. Gazans, including young children, and Hamas gunmen, gather shortly before the release of three Israeli hostages in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip on February 22, 2025. (Eyad BABA / AFP) Asked about Hamdan’s remarks, Abu Marzouk told The New York Times that no one leader could set the organization’s agenda. Qassem, the Hamas spokesman, also rejected the idea of disarmament, saying: “We hold onto our resistance weapon as a legitimate right, and what was attributed to Moussa Abu Marzouk does not represent the movement’s stance. Resistance in all its forms is a legitimate right for our people until liberation and return.” Asked about the ongoing, fragile hostage release-ceasefire deal, which has paused fighting in the Strip as Hamas has freed captives who were mostly abducted on October 7 and Israel has set free over a thousand Palestinian security prisoners, including many terror convicts, Abu Marzouk said he was open to extending the three-part deal’s first phase, which is currently slated to end on Saturday. He said, however, that the group would demand far more security prisoners released in exchange for each of the remaining hostages than it had for those released in the past, noting that Hamas considers all the remaining living captives — including those who are in fact civilians — to be soldiers. Abu Marzouk suggested 500-to-1 and 1,000-to-1 as possible prisoner-to-hostage ratios for the remaining captives, which are likely to be rejected out of hand by Israel.

(AP Photo Alshrafi) The interview was conducted before Israel’s decision on Saturday to freeze the release of 602 security inmates in exchange for six living hostages, after five of those hostages were released in propaganda ceremonies that the state called “humiliations.” Abu Marzouk added that Hamas is also open to releasing all the hostages at once, in exchange for an end to the war and the release of all Palestinian prisoners — terms which Israel has rejected. IDF responds to rocket fire, as ceasefire up in the air With the first phase of the deal set to end Saturday, negotiations are ongoing for the second phase, which envisions Hamas releasing all remaining living hostages — believed to be at least 24 of the 63 captives — in exchange for several thousand Palestinian security prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a permanent end to the war.

(Menahem KAHANA / AFP) US President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday that, “We will get to phase two… I think it’s going to happen,” but called any Hamas role in the postwar government of the Strip a “red line.” Israeli leaders have repeatedly stressed in recent days that there are battle plans ready in the event that the deal should collapse and fighting resume. On Monday, the Israel Defense Forces struck a rocket launching site in Gaza, from which a rocket had been fired at Israel but fell short in the Strip, the military said. It added that a second rocket launch site in the area was also targeted.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4lp2pw9pko,"The Taliban has told the BBC it will endeavour to release two British nationals who have been arrested and held in Afghanistan ""as soon as possible"". Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were arrested on 1 February while returning to their home in the country's Bamiyan province. An American national and an Afghan were also arrested alongside the couple, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Affairs said. The UK Foreign Office said on Monday it was supporting their family. In a statement, Taliban official Abdul Mateen Qani said: ""A series of considerations is being taken into account, and after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible."" All three foreign nationals had Afghan passports and national ID cards, he added. The reason for Mr and Mrs Reynolds's arrest has not been confirmed. The couple had been running training projects in Afghanistan for 18 years, including one that involved training mothers and children. Their work had apparently been approved by the local authorities, despite the Taliban banning education for girls over the age of 12 and not allowing women to work. The Taliban announced women would be banned from working for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in 2022. Last December, it said it would close any NGOs employing women. The pair married in Kabul in 1970. They remained in Afghanistan after the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, which saw most westerners leave the country. Their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, told the BBC she had not heard from her parents in more than two weeks. They had communicated by text after the pair were initially arrested, but contact stopped after three days. Ms Entwistle and her siblings wrote to the Taliban to plead for their parents' release. ""We recognise that there have been instances where exchanges have been beneficial for your government and western nations,"" they wrote. ""However, our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded."" On Monday, Ms Entwistle said they had wanted to give the Taliban an opportunity ""to explain their reasons,"" because Mr and Mrs Reynolds had ""always sought to honour"" the group. But she said they could no longer wait, telling Times Radio: ""We are now urgently calling on the British consulate to do everything in their power to get us answers and to put as much pressure as they can on the Taliban for their release"". The UK shut its embassy in Kabul and withdrew its diplomats from the country after the Taliban returned to power. The Foreign Office says support for British nationals in Afghanistan is therefore ""severely limited"" and advises against all travel to the country.

China’s Maritime Safety Administration said the exercises would be focused on the Beibu Gulf area, closer to the Chinese side of the Gulf of Tonkin, and would run through Thursday evening. It gave no further details, but the drills follow an announcement last week by Vietnam establishing a baseline used to calculate the width of its territorial waters in the Gulf of Tonkin. State-run Vietnam News reported that the baseline was in compliance with the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea and would provide “a robust legal basis for safeguarding and exercising Vietnam’s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction.” Vietnam has not publicly responded to the Chinese drills. China and Vietnam have long had a maritime agreement governing the Gulf of Tonkin, but have been locked in competing claims in the nearby South China Sea over the Spratly and Paracel Islands and maritime areas. China has been been growing aggressive in pursuing those claims, and in October assaulted 10 Vietnamese fishermen near the Paracel Islands, three of whom suffered broken limbs. Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. China claims almost the entire South China Sea as its own, though it has not publicly released exact coordinates of its claim other than a map with 10 dashed lines broadly demarcating what it calls its territory. In addition to Vietnam, China’s claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan, while Indonesia has also figured in violent confrontations with the Chinese coast guard and fishing fleets in the waters around the Natuna Islands. Tensions have been particularly high with the Philippines, with regular confrontations between the two countries. Most recently, a Chinese navy helicopter flew within 10 feet (3 meters) of a Philippine patrol plane last week over the South China Sea, near the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal off the northwestern Philippines. Leaders in Australia and New Zealand also said China should have given more warning before its navy conducted an unusual series of live-fire exercises in the seas between the two countries, forcing flights on Friday and Saturday to divert on short notice. Political leaders from both countries emphasized that China didn’t breach international law, but said they had only been given “a couple hours notice” rather than the usual 12 to 24 hours.",China holds live-fire exercises in Gulf of Tonkin after Vietnam marks its territorial claims,DAVID RISING,AP News,2025-02-24T05:56:38,2025-02-24T21:14:13,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250224000800315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, Feb. 24 (Yonhap) -- North Korea threatened Monday to take ""resolute"" action after a South Korea-led monitoring group implementing U.N. sanctions against the North over its nuclear and missile programs has launched official activities. The North's threat came as the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT), established by South Korea and 10 other countries in October, pledged to ensure the full implementation of U.N. sanctions against North Korea at the inaugural meeting of its steering committee last week. Calling the MSMT an ""illegal and criminal ghost group,"" the chief of the external policy office at North Korea's foreign ministry warned that hostile forces will have to ""pay a steep price"" for their attempt to block the exercising of North Korea's sovereign rights, according to the Korean Central News Agency. ""The DPRK will never thirst for a lifting of sanctions but will never overlook the provocations of the U.S. and its followers to encroach upon the legitimate sovereignty of the DPRK under the pretext of implementing sanctions and strongly counter them with resolute actions,"" the official said. DPRK stands for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ""Sanctions waiver through negotiations is not a matter of concern from long ago for the DPRK, which has no sanctions to be canceled and to be added, and it is not on the agenda of the DPRK,"" the official noted. With Seoul's initiative, the 11 countries, including the United States and Japan, established the MSMT last October to continue the sanctions monitoring against North Korea following the disbandment of the U.N. monitoring panel in April last year due to Russia's veto.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx2vwg8gq1o,"Indian authorities have banned two highly-addictive opioids in response to a BBC investigation which found they were fuelling a public health crisis in parts of West Africa. In a letter seen by the BBC from India's Drugs Controller General, Dr Rajeev Singh Raghuvanshi said permission to manufacture and export the drugs had been withdrawn BBC Eye found one pharmaceutical company, Aveo, had been illegally exporting a harmful mix of tapentadol and carisoprodol in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire. India's Food and Drug Administration said the company's factory in Mumbai had since been raided and its entire stock seized. The circular from Dr Raghuvanshi, dated to Friday, cited the BBC investigation in his decision to ban all combinations of tapentadol and carisoprodol, which was to be implemented with immediate effect. He said this also came after officials had looked into ""the potential of drug abuse and its harmful impact on population"". Tapentadol is a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant so addictive it is banned in Europe. Carisoprodol is approved for use in the US, but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia and hallucinations. The combination of the two drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world as they can cause breathing difficulties and seizures and an overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, has shipped millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. The BBC World Service also found packets of these pills with the Aveo logo for sale on the streets of Nigeria, and in Ivoirian towns and cities. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to the nation's National Bureau of Statistics. As part of the investigation, the BBC also sent an undercover operative - posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria - inside one of Aveo's factories in India, where they filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria ""who all love this product"". Sharma in response replies ""OK,"" before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can ""relax"" and agrees they can get ""high"". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: ""This is very harmful for the health,"" adding that ""nowadays, this is business"". Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals did not respond to a request for comment when the BBC's initial investigation was published. India's Food and Drug Administration said a sting operation saw Aveo's entire stock seized and further production halted in a statement on Friday. Further legal action will be taken against the company, it added. The agency said it was ""fully prepared"" to take action against anyone involved in ""illegal activities that tarnish the reputation of the country"". The FDA has been instructed to carry out further inspections to prevent the supply of the drugs, it said. It is unclear how they died - the police had referred to a possible kidnapping but now suggest an accident. The attack on a Catholic priest comes amid rising political tensions ahead of October's elections. He is accused of backing M23 rebels in the east but he has previously denied links to the group. The opposition legislator had just left parliament when he was attacked by gunmen on a motorcycle, police say. Members of a group who threatened and manipulated children into distributing drugs are sentenced. Copyright 2025 BBC.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0xnnwkppo,"Sir Keir Starmer has announced a further £200m investment in the Grangemouth site. The prime minister called the announcement an ""investment in Scotland's industrial future"" when he addressed Scottish Labour's conference in Glasgow. The money will go towards creating a new industrial purpose for the site. The oil refinery, owned by Petroineos, is set to close by the summer with the loss of more than 400 jobs. Scotland's first minister, John Swinney, announced £25m of new funding in a statement to Holyrood last week and called for the UK government to invest more in the site. Petroineos announced the refinery at the central Scotland facility would close and transition to become an import terminal after reporting massive losses last year. Redundancy letters were sent out to staff at the refinery earlier this month, with just 65 of 500 jobs expected to be retained. Approximately 2,000 people are directly employed at the site - 500 at the refinery, 450 on the Forties pipeline from the North Sea and a further 1,000 in the Ineos petrochemicals business. A £1.5m report into the feasibility of Grangemouth becoming a low-carbon energy hub, known as Project Willow, is due to be published by the end of the month. Addressing the party's Scottish conference, Sir Keir said oil and gas would be part of Scotland's future for decades to come to protect the country's energy security. But he said the UK had to be at the forefront of clean energy and that the Grangemouth site presented a ""huge opportunity for renewal"". He said the site could have a future in bioengineering, biofuels, or Hydrogen energy. He told the conference: ""We will grasp the opportunities at Grangemouth, work alongside partners to develop viable proposals, team up with business to get new industries off the ground. ""And to attract private investors into the partnership we need, we will allocate £200m from the National Wealth Fund, for investment in Grangemouth, investment in Scotland's industrial future. ""That is the difference a Labour government can make."" The PM added that working people had to be protected, and that every worker made redundant would get 18 months full pay. He said there would be a £10m skills and training offer backed by the UK government and any businesses within the Grangemouth Freeport area that takes on the refinery workers would get national insurance relief. Sir Keir said a £100m growth deal was already in place for the area, supported by both the Scottish and UK governments. The Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar told the BBC's Sunday Showthe investment would pave the way for a ""clean and secure energy future"". Sarwar previously admittedthere had been ""nowhere near enough progress"" on effortsto support workers. However, he said his party was ""determined to deliver a just transition"". He said: ""We werepromised the 'Saudi Arabia of renewables' by the SNP government, we were promised a transition by a previous Tory government that was going to be fair. ""But it has not felt fair when you looked at what is happening in Grangemouth and this is a demonstration that this UK Labour government and a Scottish Labour government too, post 2026, will be absolutely determined to deliver a genuine just transition."" He added: ""That means thousands more jobs, billions of pounds worth of inward investment and the clean energy future, and security that our country needs."" The £200m investment will come from the National Wealth Fund. The fund is publicly-owned and backed by the Treasury, and invests alongside the private sector in projects across the UK - primarily focusing on initiatives that support clean energy. The UK government said its aim was to direct ""tens of billions of pounds"" of private investment to decarbonise the British economy. An initial £5.8bn injection was earmarked for green projects including ""carbon capture, green hydrogen, ports, gigafactories and green steel,"" according to UK government documents. On Tuesday, Scotland's first minister said his government would commit £25m to establish a ""just transition"" fund for Grangemouth. This money would expedite any proposals which come from Project Willow, which is examining other industries which could exist on the site such as plastics recycling, hydrogen production and sustainable aviation fuel. John Swinney said the additional £25m would take the Scottish government's total investment for the site to £87m. He also urged the UK government to at least match the Scottish government's just transition fund. Reacting to Sunday's announcment, the first minister said the funding was a ""step in the right direction,"" but called for it to made available ""immediately"". ""I welcome this response from the prime minister to my call earlier this week for the UK government to provide its fair share of support for Grangemouth,"" he said. ""Everyone working at Grangemouth's refinery is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland's net zero future. ""We will continue to work constructively with the UK government to secure the site's future."" Unite is the sole union representing workers at the plant. It has led a campaign for the refinery to be transitioned into a production hub for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The union praised the funding but warned the ""devil would be in the detail"". General secretary Sharon Graham said the deal was ""welcome news"" but stressed it was only the start of securing the facility for future generations. She said: ""This needs to be the start not the end in delivering a real workers' transition for Grangemouth. ""It is essential that all stakeholders come together to put the meat on the bones and that this investment counts for jobs and our security. Clear timescales will be important as well as details on jobs."" Roz Foyer, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC), said securing the jobs and futures of the workforce ""must be the priority"". She added: ""This announcement cannot be dismissed lightly. However, this funding will only have a transformative impact if used correctly and is accompanied by even further investment from both governments."" Iain Hardie, of Petroineos, said: ""The prime minister's commitment to Project Willow is very welcome and reflects the quality of the work done in the initial phase of the project. ""We look forward to continuing to support both governments in the next phase as the project develops to bring together a collation of parties interested in the development of a new low-carbon future for Scotland's largest industrial cluster.""",PM announces £200m Grangemouth site support fund,James Delaney,BBC News,2025-02-23T07:38:16,2025-02-23T11:53:58,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-843394,"Israel assumes that Hamas will agree to release additional hostages as part of the current phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, two Israeli officials told The Jerusalem Post. Extending the first phase of the deal after its 42 days are up is being considered. An extension would involve the release of four male hostages – who are all fathers – and others who are critically wounded, in exchange for prolonging the ceasefire during Ramadan, according to an official. The holy month is expected to begin on Friday evening. The first phase of the deal expires on March 1, at which point Israel and Hamas would return to war. “Hamas, for now, wants the deal to continue,” the officials told the Post following a four-hour meeting on Saturday night. “It’s in their interests. They want more convoys and heavy equipment to enter Gaza, and they don’t want to be the side – at this point – that causes the deal to collapse.” US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday that the US expects the second phase to advance. Witkoff made the comment in a CNN interview when asked about Israel’s decision to postpone the release of Palestinian prisoners. “We have to get an extension of phase one,” he said. “I’ll be going to the region this week, probably Wednesday, to negotiate that.” In a later interview with CBS News, Witkoff said the second phase means ending the war and excluding Hamas from any future government. The agreement was already signed at the end of last May, he said. He added that everything is still under discussion. Witkoff said he would be in the Middle East for five days. He will travel to Qatar, Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. He also mentioned American hostage Edan Alexander in his interview with CBS, saying the US administration is in “frequent contact” with his family. He said he believes the Trump administration will succeed in releasing Alexander from captivity. Hostage deal Since the beginning of phase one, 29 Israeli hostages have been released, as well as an additional five Thai hostages. On Saturday night, the Prime Minister’s Office announced that Israel will postpone the release of Palestinian prisoners until more Israeli hostages are freed, citing Hamas’s repeated violations of the deal. Hamas on Sunday condemned Israel’s decision, saying its claim that the hostages’ handover ceremonies are “humiliating” was false and a pretext to evade Israel’s obligations under the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Hamas stated, “We will not engage in talks with Israel until it releases the 600 Palestinian terrorists from prison.”",Hamas likely to agree to release more hostages in phase one,"AMICHAI STEIN, REUTERS, JERUSALEM POST STAFF",The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-23T11:20:34,2025-02-23T17:28:00,gemini-2.0-flash

Israel launched a broad offensive on the northern West Bank on Jan. 21 — two days after the ceasefire that paused the war in Gaza took hold — and then expanded it to include other nearby areas. Israel says it is determined to stamp out militancy in the territory, but Palestinians view such raids as part of an effort to cement Israeli control over the territory, where 3 million Palestinians live under military rule. The raids have been deadly and caused destruction to urban areas and displaced tens of thousands.
Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he had instructed the military to prepare to remain in some of the West Bank's refugee camps, from where he said some 40,000 Palestinians had fled — a figure confirmed by the United Nations — leaving the areas “emptied of residents.” He said in a statement he had ordered the military to “prepare for an extended stay in the camps that were cleared for the coming year and to not allow the return of residents or for terror to grow again.""
The military said it was expanding the raid in the West Bank to other areas and, in a rare move, was sending tanks to Jenin, long a bastion of armed struggle against Israel.

Under interim peace agreements from the early 1990s, Israel maintains control over large parts of the West Bank while the Palestinian Authority administers other areas. Israel regularly sends troops into Palestinian zones but it typically withdraws them once forces complete their missions.
The UN says the current operation is the longest since the early 2000s when Israel regularly raided the West Bank in response to a deadly Palestinian uprising.
Violence has surged in the West Bank throughout the Israel-Hamas war. Israel has carried out repeated raids during that time, but with fighting in Gaza and in Lebanon on hold, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under pressure from his far-right governing partners to crack down on militancy in the West Bank.
More than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel says most of those were militants, but stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions as well as people not involved in confrontations have also been killed. In the most recent operation, a pregnant Palestinian woman was killed.
Jewish settlers have also carried out repeated rampages throughout Palestinian areas in the territory. There has also been a spike in Palestinian attacks emanating from the West Bank and late Thursday, blasts rocked three empty parked buses in Israel, what police are viewing as a suspected militant attack.
The raid’s intensification comes at a sensitive time, as the truce between Israel and Hamas holds yet remains tenuous. Israel said it was delaying the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners until it gets assurances that Hamas stops what Israel says are “humiliating” handovers of hostages being freed. The sides do not yet appear to have begun negotiations on extending the ceasefire and its collapse could lead to renewed fighting in war-torn Gaza.
Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and Palestinians want all three territories for their future independent state.

https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3299680/india-scrambles-secure-its-place-us-china-ai-race-post-deepseek?module=top_story&pgtype=homepage,"For decades, India’s IT powerhouses have churned out code and talent that fuelled the world’s technological revolution. But with artificial intelligence poised to upend the very foundation of software services, can the world’s largest outsourcing hub pivot to an AI-driven future before it’s too late? The challenge is urgent. Chinese start-up DeepSeek has emerged as a formidable competitor to Western tech dominance with its cost-effective, open-source AI models. Industry voices say India must now seize this moment to reimagine its technological ecosystem or risk being left in the United States and China’s wake. “While software services have long been the backbone of digital transformation, AI’s ability to automate complex processes, enhance decision-making and create new revenue streams, among a host of other benefits, is compelling forward-looking organisations to recalibrate their focus,” said Raj Kapoor, founder and chairman of India Blockchain Alliance. A recent International Monetary Fund report warned that nearly 40 per cent jobs worldwide could be affected by AI. Meanwhile, the global software-services market – in which India holds a commanding 44 per cent share, according to New Delhi – faces slowing growth, with an annual expansion rate projected at 11.9 per cent through 2028. By contrast, AI is set to grow at a staggering 37.3 per cent annually between 2024 and 2030, according to data cited by Kapoor. India’s leaders are aware of the stakes. Last March, the government launched the US$1.25 billion “IndiaAI Mission” to nurture start-ups and build infrastructure. A modest US$575,000 allocation in the latest federal budget is also aimed at establishing three AI education centres focused on research. And IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in January that India’s foundational AI model, customised for its diverse cultural and linguistic needs, could be ready within months.","India scrambles to secure its place in US-China AI race, post-DeepSeek",Biman Mukherji,South China Morning Post,2025-02-23T09:00:14,2025-02-23T09:00:14,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazils-oil-and-gas-sector-to-attract-over-120-billion-in-investments-by-2029/,"Brazil’s oil and gas industry is set for a major boost, with investments projected to surpass R$ 609 billion ($122 billion) between 2025 and 2029, according to data from the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP). These funds will largely focus on offshore production in Brazil’s Campos and Santos Basins, which will receive nearly 90% of the total investment. The Campos Basin will secure R$ 195.8 billion, or 32.2% of the total, while the Santos Basin will attract R$ 347 billion, representing 57.1%. These two basins are essential to Brazil’s energy output due to their pre-salt reserves, which rank among the most productive deepwater oil fields globally. Offshore operations dominate Brazil’s oil strategy, with R$ 587.7 billion (96.7%) allocated to maritime activities, leaving just R$ 20 billion (3.3%) for onshore fields. TheANPprojects that Brazil will produce 4.28 million barrels of oil and 221 million cubic meters of natural gas daily during this period. In 2025 alone, investments are expected to reach R$ 139.5 billion, with the Campos and Santos Basins accounting for an overwhelming 95.85% of this amount. Petrobras, Brazil’s state-controlled oil giant, plays a central role in this expansion. The company plans to invest $77 billion in exploration and production as part of its $111 billion business plan for 2025–2029. This includes revitalizing mature fields in the Campos Basin and deploying advanced technologies to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Petrobras aims to maintain its position as a low-cost producer while addressing environmental concerns through $16.3 billion in low-carbon initiatives. Brazil’s focus on offshore production reflects its strategic advantage in pre-salt reserves, where breakeven costs remain below $40 per barrel. As one of the world’s largest crude exporters—shipping an average of 1.6 million barrels daily—Brazil continues to play a critical role in global energy markets. Thisinvestmentsurge highlights Brazil’s dual approach: expanding fossil fuel production while investing in renewable energy and emissions reduction technologies. Oil remains a cornerstone of Brazil’s economy, contributing over $33 billion annually in trade surpluses, even as the country aligns with global sustainability trends.

Nasrallah died after Israel’s air force dropped more than 80 bombs on the militant group’s main operations room in a southern suburb of the Lebanese capital, dealing a major blow to the Iran-backed group and political party that he had transformed into a potent force in the Middle East. He was one of Hezbollah’s founders and led it for more than 30 years, enjoying wide influence among the so-called Iran-led “axis of resistance” that also included Iraqi, Yemeni and Palestinian factions. Nasrallah also became an icon in other parts of the Arab world after Hezbollah fought Israel to a draw in a brutal monthlong war in 2006, but the group’s image suffered after it intervened on the side of former President Bashar Assad in Syria’s civil war. Hezbollah called on its supporters to attend the funeral in large numbers in what appears to be a move to show that it remains powerful even after suffering significant setbacks in a 14-month war with Israel that left many of its senior political and military officials dead. A Lebanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, estimated the crowd size at 450,000. Others gave higher estimates. The pro-Hezbollah pan-Arab TV channel Al-Mayadeen reported a figure of 1.4 million. “This massive crowd confirms that Hezbollah is still the most popular party at the Lebanese level, and as a result, all the talk that Hezbollah is weak or degraded is out of place,” said Ali Fayyad, a lawmaker with the group’s political wing, who attended the funeral. Sahar al-Attar, a mourner who traveled from Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley for the funeral said, “We would have come even under bullets” to attend Nasrallah’s burial. Nasrallah shared the funeral with his cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later. Nasrallah was laid to rest Sunday in Beirut after the funeral procession, while Safieddine will be buried in his hometown in southern Lebanon. Both had temporarily been buried in secret locations. As the coffins were paraded before the huge crowd, men riding on the platforms with them tossed flowers. Some in the crowd threw clothing articles in the hope they would come in contact with the coffins, believing it would bless them. Outside of the stadium, giant screens were placed along the road leading to the airport, titling the funeral: “We are committed to the covenant.” Senior Hezbollah official Ali Daamoush told reporters Saturday that about 800 prominent figures from 65 countries would attend the funeral in addition to thousands of individuals and activists from around the world. Iranian parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi were among the officials who arrived at the Lebanese capital’s main sports stadium. Lebanon’s parliament speaker and representatives of the president and prime minister were also in attendance. The funeral also drew non-official participants from outside of Lebanon, including some from Western countries. Irish activist Tara O’Grady waved the flag of her country and said that she came to Beirut “to stand with the people of Lebanon and their resistance against the Zionist regime who are brutally continuing to bomb the south of Lebanon.” She likened Nasrallah to Irish early-20th century revolutionary Michael Collins. As O’Grady spoke with The Associated Press, four Israeli warplanes flew at low altitude over Beirut while Nasrallah’s coffin was paraded into the stadium. The crowd chanted: “Death to Israel” and “At your service, Nasrallah.” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that the fighter jets flying over the funeral “send a clear message: Whoever threatens to annihilate Israel and strike Israel — that will be his end.” Hours before and during the funeral, the Israeli military also launched a series of strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. Also on Sunday, the Israeli military released a video that said it shows the airstrike that killed Nasrallah and some of the group’s top military officials on Sept. 27, 2024. As part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that ended the war with Israel on Nov. 27, Hezbollah is not supposed to have an armed presence along the border with Israel. The group was dealt another blow with the fall of the Assad family’s five-decade rule in Syria in early December, which blocked a main route for the flow of weapons and money from Iran. Its rivals have been calling on it to lay down its weapons all over Lebanon and become a political faction. Nasrallah’s successor, Hezbollah’s current Secretary-General Naim Kassem, said in a televised speech played at the funeral that “the resistance is still present and strong in numbers and weapons, and the inevitable victory is coming.” He was not at the stadium. Kassem added that “Israel must withdraw from the areas it still occupies” in southern Lebanon, referring to five strategic border points where Israeli forces remain.",Nasrallah: Thousands attend the funeral of Hezbollah leader,"Bassem Mroue, Abby Sewell, Sally Abou Aljoud",AP News,2025-02-23T05:20:33,2025-02-22T20:34:31,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250222-sudan-recalls-ambassador-from-kenya-as-nairobi-hosts-meeting-with-rivals-rsf,"Sudan's military-led government has recalled its ambassador from Kenya, in protest at Nairobi's hosting of meetingsÂ
aimed at forming a rival Sudanese government backed by the Rapid Support Forces. Issued on:22 - 17:26 The Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced via the state-run Sudan News Agency (SUNA) that theSudaneseauthorities recalled their ambassador from Kenya on Thursday. The diplomatic row began when the Founding Alliance for SudanÂ
was created in the Kenyan capital on Tuesday. This coalition is built around General Hemedtiâ

s Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and aims to establish a parallel government to the one in Port Sudan, which is led by the Sudanese army. The move came despite Hemedti being under United States sanctions, as he and his soldiers are accused of committing genocide in Darfur. In Kenya, members of the political sphere and civil society have struggled to understand how Kenyan President William Ruto could have allowed such an event to take place inNairobi. Sudan war is world's 'worst humanitarian crisis', the African Union says Former vice-president Rigathi Gachagua posted on social media: ""We are welcoming warlords. We are making headlines for discovering a new way to embarrass the nation."" And lawyer and activist Willis Evans Otieno wrote: ""Kenya cannot afford to become a breeding ground for foreign insurgencies."" In a statement, Sudan's foreign ministry accused Ruto of adopting a ""disgraceful position by embracing and encouraging a conspiracy"" that it says violates Sudan's sovereignty. The ministry summoned its envoy ""for consultations in protest against Kenya hosting the meetings of the rebel militia and its allies in another hostile move against Sudan,"" SUNA reported on Thursday. The paramilitary RSF, which has been at war with the army in Sudan for nearly two years, said at the event in Nairobi this week that they would sign a founding charter that would lead to the formation of a ""peace and unity government"". A source close to the organisers of the RSF meeting told news agencies that the signing of the charter, originally planned for Tuesday, had been postponed until the weekend. The war between the army and the RSF broke out in April 2023 and has killed tens of thousands of people, and uprooted more than 12 million. It has torn the country in two, with the army in control of the north and east, while the RSF holds nearly all of the west and large areas of the south. In a series of offensives this year, the army has retaken parts of greater Khartoum as well as the Al Jazirah state to its south. The RSF's preparations to form a rival government in territories it controls come as it seeks to consolidate its hold on the Darfur region of western Sudan, where only the city of Al-Fashir and its environs are held by the army. A spokesman forUnited Nationschief Antonio Guterres warned on Wednesday that the move could ""increase the fragmentation of the country and risk making this crisis even worse"". On Thursday, the Arab League condemned ""any steps that would undermine the unity of Sudan or expose it to division or fragmentation"". Drone strike on Darfur hospital kills 30 as Sudan conflict persists The Kenyan foreign ministry defended its hosting of the RSF event, saying this was ""compatible with Kenya's role in peace negotiations"". The Sudanese military-led government responded by accusing President Ruto of acting on ""his commercial and personal interests with the militia's regional sponsors"" â

 alluding to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has been widely accused of arming the RSF, despite its repeated denials. Last month, Kenya and theUAEsigned an economic agreement, which Ruto's office hailed as ""a historic milestone"" and ""the first agreement of its kind"". In December 2024, theÂ
UAE became the largest backer of new business projects in Africa, raising concerns about human rights and environmental protection. The positioning of Kenya's officials continues to cause concern. Martin Mavenjina of theKenya Human Rights Commissionsaid: ""Nairobi has not only become a haven for persona non grata but also the capital of transnational oppression."" Kenya probes alleged police involvement in abduction of government critics The abduction of foreign political opponents appears to be on the rise in Kenya. In November,Uganda's opposition figure Kizza Besigye was kidnapped in Nairobi and reappeared a few days later before a military court in his home country. Otsieno Namwaya ofHuman Rights Watchquestioned the country's future standing on the regional and international stage, as he believes: ""The Kenyan government no longer respects any international law.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8yvg5359po,"Health officials in two US states are tracking measles outbreaks as cases rise to nearly 100 people. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported on Friday that it was aware of 90 cases diagnosed in the last month in the South Plains area, in the north-west part of the state. At least 77 of them were reported in children and teens under 17. In New Mexico, officials said nine people had become sick in Lea County, along the state's eastern border with Texas. Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly. The outbreaks come amid a rise in US anti-vaccine sentiment, including towards the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab that is typically given during childhood. Health officials in Texas say their figures are likely to be an underestimate, as some parents may not report infections or may not realise their child has the disease. ""It is troubling, because this was completely preventable,"" Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner. ""It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans,"" he added. Symptoms of the highly-infectious illness include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a rash. A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death. Survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Most US children receive two shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates - generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the vaccine. But vaccination rates have dropped in some communities in recent decades as a loose network of vaccine sceptics have, without evidence, questioned the safety and efficacy of the shots. Robert F Kennedy Jr, recently confirmed as US President Donald Trump's health secretary, has faced strong criticism for his ties to these groups. Most states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption - a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement. In Texas, federal data shows that the state achieved a 94.3% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2023-2024 school year, while New Mexico reached 95%. But a state survey of Texas schools found that rates of exemptions were ticking upwards for MMR and other required vaccines. In Gaines County, where 57 of the Texas cases were reported, exemptions have surged over the last decade. State data shows 17.62% of students had a conscientious exemption to at least one required vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, up from 7.45% in the 2013-2014 year. Neighbouring Terry County, home to 20 cases, saw exemption rates go from zero to 3.73% in the same time period. Texas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unclear. CBS reports that the area is home to a large Mennonite community, which typically have low vaccination rates due to the group's religious beliefs. Some officials are reluctant to intervene. ""We respect everyone's right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated,"" Albert Pilkington, CEO of the nearby Seminole Hospital District, told the Texas Standard. ""That's just what it means to be an American, right?"" US children have been vaccinated against measles since 1963. The jab was improved and combined with vaccines for the mumps and rubella viruses about a decade later, and is widely considered to be safe. Prior to the vaccine's introduction, around 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles each year and 400–500 people died. In 2024, the US reported 285 cases with 114 hospitalisations. Health officials in New Mexico are offering a free vaccine clinic this week in an effort to boost protection. Texas also directed residents to contact their doctors or visit a clinic to get vaccinated if they have not previously received a shot.",US measles outbreak leaves nearly 100 ill in Texas and New Mexico,Laura Blasey,BBC News,2025-02-22T19:24:18,2025-02-22T19:24:18,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250222001500315,"KYIV, Feb. 22 (Yonhap) -- A Ukrainian defense intelligence official has mentioned the possibility of sending North Korean soldiers captured during combat to South Korea, in the first such acknowledgment by Kyiv. Andriy Chernyak, the representative of defense intelligence of Ukraine, made the remark in an exclusive interview with Yonhap News Agency in Kyiv on Friday (local time) when asked about the two North Korean soldiers held in Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. ""Everything is possible,"" Chernyak said in the interview conducted in Ukrainian. ""Nowadays, we cooperate with the South Korean government very closely. We have tight connections with your defense intelligence and special forces. So we think that such a situation may happen."" One of the two North Korean soldiers expressed his intention to defect to the South in a recent interview with the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo. The South Korean government has since said it is willing to provide protection and support if the soldiers request to come to the South, treating them as South Korean citizens, as guaranteed under the country's Constitution. Chernyak, who works for the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, the military intelligence agency of the Ministry of Defense, said he cannot disclose the location where the North Korean prisoners are being held. ""But all their needs are covered, they have everything necessary and they are situated in a protected, safe place,"" he said. Chernyak said the 11,000 North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia are posing a ""real problem"" for not only Ukraine but also the Asia-Pacific region. Around 4,000 of them have already been killed or seriously wounded, he said, but some could return to the battlefield after recovering. ""In this way, the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is prolonging,"" Chernyak said. ""Why I say it's a danger not only for Ukraine is because if those soldiers are injured, they will come back home and they are those people who have studied in real war conditions. This knowledge includes UAV tactics and small infantry group tactics."" Chernyak added, ""Right now in the world, only the Ukrainian and Russian armies have such experience, and North Korea is getting it too."" When asked about reports that North Korean troops had disappeared from the front lines since mid-January, Chernyak dismissed them as untrue. ""Actually they didn't disappear,"" he said. ""They were just taken back â	 because of the huge losses. They were completed and returned back to the battlefield."" He also said by Ukraine's estimates, North Korea could send an additional 150,000 troops in support of Russia's invasion. ""In the beginning, the North Korean soldiers didn't understand what to do,"" Chernyak said. ""They had used the wrong tactics. That's why they had so many losses. But they learn very fast. And now they have become quite skillful and professional. They have no fear of death and fight bravely."" Russian soldiers, however, ""undervalue them and act like North Korean soldiers are lower class,"" he said. ""But honestly, we have to note their skills."" On the negotiations between the United States and Russia to end the war, Chernyak said Moscow will try to prove Ukraine's armed forces are unable to protect the country. ""Russia is trying to activate their efforts along the whole front line. Even though there are no active hostilities, they enhance their intelligence operations,"" he said. ""No doubt they are going to use that for influencing the negotiation process."" Chernyak added, ""We shouldn't undervalue the enemy ... But on the other hand we have seen that the Russian Army is not so scary as they wanted to show."" The official stressed Ukraine ""can still hold the front line and fight"" and Russians have paid ""a high cost with the great human resource losses."" hague@yna.co.kr(END)",(Yonhap Interview) Ukraine official says sending of N.K.

https://apnews.com/article/panama-boat-capsize-migrants-fdf203b07bd521e60a3e3d1336441edd,"PANAMA CITY (AP) — A boat carrying 19 migrants — part of a “reverse flow” of migrants who once hoped to reach the United States — capsized off the Caribbean coast of Panama on Saturday, claiming the life of an 8-year-old Venezuelan boy, border authorities said. The boat, full of mostly Venezuelans and Colombians, carried 21 people in total, including two Indigenous Panamanians in charge of maneuvering the vessel headed toward Colombia. Authorities say the accident happened because of choppy sea conditions, which discouraged two other boats from making the trip. Twenty people were rescued, Panamanian border police confirmed, adding they “are deeply sorry about the death of the minor.” A growing number of migrants who once hoped to reach the U.S. have begun a “reverse flow” back to their countries of origin due to a tightening of immigration policy under U.S. President Donald Trump. Many of those migrants waited for months, sometimes more than a year, to apply for formal asylum in the U.S. using the Biden-era CBP One app. Those hopes were washed away when Trump took office and immediately closed down the app. Panama has not shared figures on how many migrants in the “reverse flow” pass through the country per day, but in neighboring Costa Rica, an official told The Associated Press this week they were seeing between 50 and 75 new migrants traveling south daily. With few resources or ways to get home, many South American migrants have started to travel home to their Andean countries with the help of smugglers. They often use small, motorized boats that travel through the Guna Yala, an archipelago with hundreds of small islands in the Caribbean. The boats often make trips between nearby coastal communities in Colombia and Panama. One pair of migrants who spoke to AP said they wanted to take the marine route because it was safer than traveling through the perilous jungled trenches of the Darien Gap, which divides Panama and Colombia. Smugglers once raked in money when migration flows north were heavy more than a year ago, and continue to make a smaller profit on migrants traveling back. Panama’s National Coastal Service said in a statement that Saturday’s boat capsizing was due to heavy swells in the archipelago. Border police and villagers were carrying out search and rescue efforts. Meanwhile, dozens of other migrants were being transported on Saturday to Guna Yala to begin their return by sea.",8-year-old boy dies as boat carrying 'reverse flow' of migrants capsizes off Panama coast,,AP News,2025-02-22T22:06:42,2025-02-22T17:06:42,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250222000700315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, Feb. 22 (Yonhap) -- North Korea warned Saturday it will mobilize ""strategic means"" against what it called strategic threats from the United States and other adversaries, in response to a joint military exercise between South Korea and the U.S. involving a U.S. strategic bomber. The chief of the press office at North Korea's defense ministry issued a statement after Seoul and Washington staged combined air drills, involving at least one B-1B bomber, on Thursday for the first time since the launch of the Trump administration. ""The DPRK will counter the strategic threat of the U.S. and other enemies with strategic means and continue its responsible military activities to control and manage the unstable security environment on the Korean Peninsula with powerful deterrence,"" the official was quoted as saying by the Korean Central News Agency. DPRK stands for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. North Korea claimed that since the Trump administration took office last month, the U.S. has been intensifying its military provocations threatening the security of the North. North Korea's rapid and accelerating move to bolster its nuclear force is a ""realistic requirement for coping with the military threat from the U.S. and its satellite countries which are getting more rampant recently,"" the official argued. North Korea has long denounced a joint military exercise between South Korea and the U.S. as a rehearsal for invasion though the allies said such drills are defensive in nature. The North has used Seoul-Washington's military drills as a pretext for provocations.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-843234,"Six hostages were released from Hamas captivity Saturday, as Tal Shoham, Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert, and Eliya Cohen returned to Israel after 505 days, and Avera Mengistu and Hisham Al-Sayed returned after being held by Hamas since 2014 and 2015, respectively.  Mengistu and Shoham were released in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, while Shem Tov, Wenkert, and Cohen were released from the Nuseirat refugee camp shortly after. Al-Sayed was then released from captivity in Gaza City. This marks the first time in the deal that hostages were released in Nuseirat and in Rafah. Saturday's transfer was the seventh wave of releases in the hostage deal. Like in previous hostage releases, the Hamas terrorist organization set up a propaganda ceremony by setting up a stage in Rafah decorated with provoking images and captions. Saturday morning's caption read, ""The land distinguishes its people from the dual nationality figures.” Hamas terrorists were filmed standing in a line in the pouring rain, armed with long rifles, according to Ynet. Shoham was forced to make a speech on Hamas's makeshift stage before he and Mengistu were handed to the Red Cross. Shoham appeared pale and underweight, while Mengistu appeared relatively stable and retained a similar body weight to when he was kidnapped. Red Cross vehicles arrived in Rafah on Saturday morning to collect Mengitsu and Shoham, after which they were transferred to Israeli forces and then to the Re'im base in Israel, where they reunited with their families. Shoham was then taken to Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva for treatment, while Mengistu was treated at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. After the announcement that both safely crossed into Israeli territory, the Shoham family said, ""The Shoham, Korngold, and Haran families are moved to welcome Tal back to us. This is an unforgettable moment where all emotions are rapidly mixing together. Our Tal is with us."" ""We thank all the people of Israel who stood with us through all the long days of pain and suffering. During these days, we need privacy for Tal, Adi, and the children. At this crucial moment in our lives, our only request is to seize this window of opportunity to secure a deal that will bring fathers back to their children - children need their fathers - and return all hostages home: the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for eternal rest. There is a window of opportunity; we must not miss it."" The Mengistu family added, ""Our family has endured ten years and five months of unimaginable suffering. During this time, there have been continuous efforts to secure his return, with prayers and pleas, some silent, that remained unanswered until today. In these moments, we gather in anxious anticipation of the return of our beloved son, brother, and uncle Avera. We ask that these moments be respected and that we be granted the peace and rest we so desperately need."" The release ceremony in Nuseirat for Shem Tov, Wenkert, and Cohen happened not long after the one in Rafah. Wenkert notably lost a lot of weight. Shem Tov kissed one of the Hamas terrorists on the head while he was on stage. The three arrived at the reception point at Re'im base accompanied by IDF personnel. Hamas also added a third location, Gaza City, where they released Hisham al-Sayed. Hamas did not plan any ceremonial event for al-Sayed ""out of respect for his family and respect for Muslim Israelis,"" according to Gazan reports. Al-Sayed, like Mengitsu, has been held captive far prior to October 7, 2023, as the Bedouin-Israeli hostage was held in the Palestinian exclave for nearly a decade. In parallel with the release of the six hostages from Gaza, a Red Cross convoy arrived at the Kerem Shalom crossing to receive Palestinian security prisoners who were released in exchange from prisons in Israel, Walla reported. KAN reported that about 602 prisoners were to be released on Saturday, 445 of whom were arrested in Gaza during the war. Several senior Hamas leaders from the West Bank and several prisoners who were rearrested after being released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal were among the hundreds of Palestinian security prisoners set to be released on Saturday. They were all given shirts that said, ""I will pursue my enemies and catch them,"" according to KAN. Among those who were set to be released on Saturday were 41 prisoners rearrested after being freed in the Gilad Shalit deal, 50 who were supposed to be serving life sentences, and 60 who were sentenced to long prison terms, according to Army Radio. Hamas said on Saturday it was ready to move to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal and to carry out a comprehensive hostage-prisoner exchange to achieve a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal of Israeli troops.

https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-pneumonia-hospital-b211a400c4cedc1f419d932447cfc189,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis’ complex respiratory infection isn’t life-threatening but he’s not out of danger, his medical team said Friday, as the 88-year-old pontiff marked his first week in the hospital battling pneumonia in both lungs — along with bacterial, viral and fungal infections on top of his chronic bronchitis. Francis’ doctors delivered their first in-person update on the pope’s condition, saying he will remain at Rome’s Gemelli hospital at least through next week. The pope is receiving occasional supplements of oxygen when he needs it and is responding to the drug therapy that was strengthened after the multiple infections were diagnosed, they said. Gemelli hospital Dr. Sergio Alfieri and Francis’ personal physician, Dr. Luigi Carbone, said Francis remains in good spirits and humor. Alfieri said that when he entered Francis’ suite to greet him on Friday morning as “Holy Father,” the pope replied by referring to Alfieri as “Holy Son.” “To the question ‘is the pope out of danger?’ No, the pope is not out of danger,” Alfieri said. “If you then ask if in this moment the pope is in a life-threatening situation, the answer is also no.” “Just now he went from his room to the chapel to pray for 20 minutes,” he said. “This is the situation. He is the pope, but he is also a man.” Francis was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex respiratory infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs on top of chronic bronchitis. They prescribed “absolute rest.” Alfieri said the pope came down with a seasonal infection that has filled hospitals, but with a difference. “Other 88-year-old people generally stay at home and watch TV in a rocking chair. Do you know any other 88-year-olds who govern, let’s say, a state and is also the spiritual father of all Catholics in the world? He does not spare himself, because he is enormously generous, so he got tired,″ Alfieri said. Francis is a known workaholic and has admitted to being a not-terribly-compliant patient in the past. Alfieri said he had been a “great patient” since he was admitted, but turned the floor over to Carbone to respond to whether he was disciplined when home, at the Santa Marta hotel in the Vatican where he lives. “He loves the church, and so it’s clear he put the church first while we cared for him at Santa Marta,” Carbone replied. Carbone said that Francis was responding to the drug therapy that was “strengthened” after the pneumonia was diagnosed earlier this week. He is also fighting a multipronged infection caused by bacteria, virus and fungus in the respiratory tract. Doctors said there was no evidence the germs had entered his bloodstream, a condition known as sepsis that they said remains the biggest concern. Sepsis is a complication of an infection that can lead to organ failure and death. Francis is receiving supplemental oxygen when he needs it through a nasal cannula, a thin flexible tube that delivers oxygen through the nose, but otherwise is attached to no other machinery. The doctors said Francis’ chronic bronchitis had caused permanent damage to his airways, a condition known as bronchiectasis. The cortisone treatment he received in the hospital has raised his blood sugar levels, requiring treatment for diabetes. But Alfieri said he hoped the condition would be temporary. In the best scenario, the pope will return to his residence cured of the infections, but his chronic conditions will remain, Alfieri said. As his hospital stay drags on, some of Francis’ cardinals have begun responding to the obvious question that is circulating: whether Francis might resign if he becomes irreversibly sick and unable to carry on. Francis has said he would consider it, after Pope Benedict XVI “opened the door” to popes retiring, but has shown no signs of stepping down and in fact has asserted recently that the job of pope is for life. Francis confirmed in 2022 that, shortly after being elected pontiff, he wrote a resignation letter in case medical problems impeded him from carrying out his duties. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. But there is no indication Francis is in any way incapacitated or is even considering stepping aside. During his hospital stay, he has continued to work, including making bishop appointments. After a hospital stay in 2021, he bristled when he learned that some clergy were allegedly already preparing for a conclave to elect his successor. Francis had an acute case of pneumonia in 2023 and is prone to respiratory infections in winter. Doctors say pneumonia in such a fragile, older patient makes him particularly prone to complications, given the difficulty in being able to effectively expel fluid from his lungs. While his heart is strong, Francis isn’t a particularly healthy 88-year-old. He is overweight, is not physically active, uses a wheelchair because of bad knees and had part of one lung removed as a young man. Despite the seriousness of Francis’ illness, it appears there have been moments of levity. Alfieri said he bowed his head close to the pope to explain that the hospitalization would continue until he could safely return to his residence at the Vatican. “He asked if I wanted to say confession,″ the doctor said. “I said, ‘Holy Father, if I have to confess, your hospitalization will be much, much longer.’” ___ Barry reported from Milan.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/20/ai-economy-undersea-cables-international-data-infrastructure/,"The artificial intelligence-powered economy has a massive vulnerability: the ocean. The digital world is connected by subsea cables, a roughly 750,000-mile network that could circle the globe 30 times. Laid as deep as five miles below the surface, these cords make daily life—and the global marketplace—possible. While 80 percent of international trade by volume is transported on the sea’s surface, 95 percent of international data flows under it, including instant messages, an estimated $10 trillion in daily financial transactions, and countries’ national-security secrets. Meanwhile, power generated offshore, a growing share of global energy, is often transported via subsea cables. The artificial intelligence-powered economy has a massive vulnerability: the ocean. The digital world is connected by subsea cables, a roughly 750,000-mile network that could circle the globe 30 times. Laid as deep as five miles below the surface, these cords make daily life—and the global marketplace—possible. While 80 percent of international trade by volume is transported on the sea’s surface, 95 percent of international data flows under it, including instant messages, an estimated $10 trillion in daily financial transactions, and countries’ national-security secrets. Meanwhile, power generated offshore, a growing share of global energy, is often transported via subsea cables. These two elements—data and power—are the foundations of the AI economy. But the subsea cables through which they flow face escalating dangers, and multiple incidents in the past few months have highlighted those risks. In November, a Chinese vessel reportedly dragged its anchor along the Baltic seabed for more than 100 miles, severing data cables between Sweden and Lithuania as well as between Finland and Germany. NATO ships had to intervene. A month later, a Russian oil tanker believed to be part of Moscow’s “ghost fleet” cut a cable carrying power between Finland and Estonia, only to be seized by Finnish authorities. The German foreign minister called these incidents a “wake-up call” for Europe. NATO has since established a new mission in the Baltic to protect undersea infrastructure. But the challenge is global and persistent—in a sign of the heightened tempo of such incidents, another undersea cable—located to the north of Taiwan, which is connected to the outside digital world through just 15 cables—was damaged in early January, potentially by a Chinese ship. Shortly after, two cables to the Taiwan-governed Matsu Islands disconnected due to what Taiwan’s Digital Affairs Ministry called “natural deterioration,” though backup microwave communications were activated to keep the islands’ 14,000 residents online. In some cases, disruptions are accidental. Backup systems can often limit the negative effects, as they did during the most recent Matsu incident. However, whatever their causes, the consequences of the approximately 150 cable-breaking incidents a year can often be severe, and include internet shutdowns, espionage, and costly repairs and delays. In one dire incident in 2008, the severing of two Mediterranean cables shut down internet access in 14 countries, including 100 percent of connections in the Maldives, and 82 percent in India. What makes today’s risks even more vexing than they were then are questions of scale and significance. One-off cable cuts are relatively straightforward to fix. But if cables are damaged at particularly sensitive times or places, or on a wider geographic scale, then that task is much more challenging. Meanwhile, subsea cables are growing even more necessary to daily life as artificial intelligence increases demands for global data transmission, including through overseas data centers connected to the global cable networks. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being invested in AI infrastructure every year. But that infrastructure is often connected through one of the thinnest, and potentially most vulnerable, physical networks on the planet. The individual fiber optic strands that, combined, make up the subsea cables through which world’s information flows are often barely thicker than a human hair. And that delicate infrastructure predates the digital age. The first undersea cables made trans-Atlantic telegraph communication possible in the 1850s, and through the technological revolutions since, they’ve connected telephones, modern telecommunications devices, and now the global AI infrastructure. In recent decades, three main players, analogous to national champions, have dominated the global subsea cable market: SubCom in the United States, NEC Corporation in Japan, and Alcatel Submarine Networks in France. As of 2021, these three companies held a 87 percent global market share. However, in recent years, China has disrupted the subsea cable ecosystem. Huawei Marine Networks was founded in 2008, and it soon became the fastest-growing subsea cable provider and the fourth-largest in the industry. From 2018 to 2022, HMN Tech, as it was renamed in the intervening years, supplied 18 percent of new cables based on total length. The company’s success followed the playbook of many Chinese technology champions, with subsidies from the Chinese government allowing it to submit lower bids on projects than free-market competitors. The latest, and perhaps most consequential, market shift in the industry is happening now: the proliferation of artificial intelligence. As data has become the foundation for both the digital economy and the emerging AI industry over the past decade, hyperscalers—or large computing and cloud services providers such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon—have become major players in the subsea cable market. Most cables are now built by consortiums of hyperscaler and telecommunication companies. As technology companies build up their cloud and AI capabilities and construct more data centers globally, they also invest in more subsea cables. Today, Google is a part or sole owner of roughly 33 cables. Even in a stable international environment, it would be impossible to separate subsea cables from geopolitics. There are always risks of sabotage or espionage and the need to adapt to national and international standards-setting. Every international cable project needs government approvals along its routes. But in a more competitive—even combative—period in global affairs, the subsea cable market has become a more contested arena. In 2023, FP columnist Elizabeth Braw argued that we are “entering the era of the undersea Iron Curtain.” The public debut of ChatGPT in late 2022 and the proliferation of AI-enabled tools since have brought this 20th-century division into a new period in the history of technology. Because of the rise of AI, these cables are more important than they were even two years ago. The contest over subsea cables entails old tools of statecraft, such as deterrence and incentives, deployed in new domains. And in recent years, that contest has played out in every major geopolitical theater, affecting global consumers and many of the world’s leading companies. In Europe, a Chinese-flagged ship is suspected of having damaged a Baltic subsea cable in October 2023, a year before the Baltic Sea sabotage that triggered a NATO response a few weeks ago. In another incident earlier in 2023, another Chinese-flagged vessel reportedly damaged the cables connecting Taiwan with its aforementioned outlying Matsu Islands, leaving them without internet for weeks. And the warning signs flashed even brighter in 2024. Early last year in the Middle East, three cables in the Red Sea—where 90 percent of Europe-Asia communication flows—were damaged when the anchor of a commercial ship sunk by Houthi missiles dragged along the ocean floor. And U.S. officials told CNN last fall that Russia is developing a deep sea-focused military unit, a capability that could give Moscow new tools for aggression and gray-zone operations and attacks that fall short of war. The United States’ concern about subsea cables is growing and bipartisan. In 2019, worried about China’s civil-military fusion, espionage, and cyberthreats, the first Trump administration sanctioned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. The Trump era’s State Department’s multilateral Clean Network initiative included a “Clean Cable” pillar “to ensure undersea cables connecting [the U.S.] to the global internet are not subverted for intelligence gathering by the [People’s Republic of China] at hyper scale.” In 2024, under the Biden administration, the State Department built on those initiatives released the “New York Joint Statement on the Security and Resilience of Undersea Cables,” a set of principles endorsed by 30 countries at the United Nations General Assembly. The United States is also a member of the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience, announced in 2023. As world powers vie for regional influence and partnerships, subsea cable infrastructure contracts have become commercial contests for spheres of geopolitical influence. In 2021, HMN Tech was pushed out of a project linking three Pacific islands, including the Federated States of Micronesia, which has a defense agreement with the United States. The project was scrapped and later replaced by the East Micronesia Cable project, jointly funded by the United States, Australia, and Japan. Meanwhile, Vietnam—which has five aging subsea cables—is upgrading its infrastructure, creating a new opening for international ties. U.S. officials and telecommunications companies have held multiple meetings with Vietnamese officials to dissuade them from using geopolitically problematic companies, with officials reportedly pointing out that the choice of infrastructure providers could make Vietnam more or less attractive for international investment. For many countries, physical connections to Chinese cables are viewed as vulnerabilities. The United States government in 2020 set up Team Telecom, an interagency group tasked with safeguarding United States telecommunications infrastructure and preventing direct cable connections between the U.S. and mainland China or Hong Kong. Team Telecom recommended that the Federal Communications Commission block the Hong Kong segment of four planned subsea cable routes. The project owners of these cables, both hyperscalers, switched their termination points to the Philippines and Taiwan, rather than Hong Kong, at an estimated cost of tens of millions of dollars. The contest over subsea cables isn’t just playing out in foreign ministries—it’s also altering how companies are governed and how the world is wired. Due in part to U.S. pressure, Huawei divested from Huawei Marine Networks in 2020, when the company rebranded to HMN Tech. More significantly than a change in name or structure, other companies have been squeezed out of projects since then. The SeaMeWe-6 cable, now under construction, will connect more than a dozen countries across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe. HMN Tech was poised to win the contract in 2020 with a bid that was approximately one-third lower than competitors’, but the United States offered five foreign telecom companies training grants worth a total of $3.8 million if they selected SubCom instead, while warning consortium members of potential sanctions against HMN Tech. SubCom ultimately won the SeaMeWe-6 contract, and Chinese companies left the consortium, to be replaced by enterprises from Malaysia and Indonesia. The results of such commercial and diplomatic maneuvering are clear: Chinese companies are losing ground in international markets. There are now only three new cables with connections in Hong Kong scheduled for 2025, and none after. For comparison, Singapore, historically a smaller market competitor than Hong Kong, has 26 subsea cables landing at three landing sites, with plans to double the number of sites by 2033. Under the sea as well as over it, the world is becoming more divided. The geography of subsea connections mirrors geopolitical divides. Rather than transiting the contested South China Sea, for example, Western consortiums now often pursue less direct avenues, such as through the Java Sea. They cover a greater distance at greater cost, but with less geopolitical risk. Guam, Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore may stand to benefit from new routes, especially as they become greater data center hubs. Meanwhile, China has increased its push for new subsea cable projects to the global south and parts of the world that are tied to its Digital Silk Road initiative, where Western interests hold less sway. A world divided into blocs by digital infrastructure may be more resilient, but security doesn’t come without trade-offs. At $40,000 to $60,000 per kilometer, cables are expensive to lay, and once they’re set and connected to facilities like data centers, they cannot be easily ripped out and replaced. Delayed, canceled, or rerouted subsea cables add uncertainty, complicating market dynamics. Longer cables laid over less efficient routes also mean more latency, as data must travel greater distances. And while casual internet users may not recognize slower speeds, quick data transfer time is critical across many industries—even milliseconds matter when it comes to executing financial transactions, let alone in military applications. In the competition over subsea cables, countries can work to increase the security of their infrastructure, but it’s not clear what victory looks like. When it comes to AI, the United States has aimed to keep and develop what former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan described as “as large a lead as possible,” especially in advanced logic and memory chips, with chip export controls and other measures in place to impede competitors’ progress. But despite the differences in products made by each enterprise, Chinese companies and the Chinese government have largely achieved self-reliance in subsea cables, with capabilities comparable to Western alternatives. That means that export controls alone can’t ensure Western advantage. While Beijing’s access to international markets has been curtailed, China possesses the technology and capabilities across the stack to manufacture all components of subsea cables at home. China also has a history of pouring heavy subsidies into the cable industry, a trend that carries across other industries from solar power to electric vehicles, and that gives it asymmetric advantages that distort markets. As a result, despite pressure, HMN Tech remains competitive, can offer lower prices, and is planning to build its own $500 million Europe-Middle East-Asia cable, a rival to the SeaMeWe-6 cable. China also has a strong foothold in cable maintenance and repair, which are critical and complex components of the infrastructure’s life cycle. The cable maintenance industry divides the ocean into zones, with certain repair ships designated to cover each. As a result, U.S.-owned cables may rely on Chinese repair ships in certain places, which could make them vulnerable to spyware, whatever their ownership. In one concerning incident, a Chinese repair company that worked on cables owned by U.S. hyperscalers appeared to hide its vessels’ locations near Taiwan and Indonesia, according to shipping data reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. This unusual and unexplained behavior raised alarm about what the vessel was doing and where it was doing it. And repairs are even more complicated and costly in conflict zones, such as during the clashes in the Red Sea last year. Even in the absence of conflict, competing claims to vital sea lanes can distort the subsea cable market. While the United States has exerted pressure to push Chinese companies out of certain projects, China has gone further, delaying or blocking permits for cables with U.S. involvement, including in the South China Sea. The rising risks to subsea cable networks are connected to crises above the surface. The Iranian-backed Houthi attacks on international shipping have damaged undersea cables in the Red Sea. Taiwan’s subsea connections are potential targets in coercion campaigns against the island. And even if Western Europe isn’t yet directly engaged in a military conflict with Moscow, its infrastructure is under threat by an expansionist Russia—and NATO is responding to that very real threat. Rather than wait for something to happen, there are proactive strategies to protect subsea cables and deter bad actors. Enhanced coordination in monitoring and management of the seas can help. Such measures may include increased patrols as well as potentially boarding and inspecting suspicious vessels, particularly in shallow areas with significant concentrations of cables. This approach could deter attacks and improve attribution when they do occur. Meanwhile, AI itself may solve some of subsea cables’ greatest vulnerabilities. The Wall Street Journal reports that AI-enabled underwater systems such as drones are already being used to identify and combat threats, even at the bottom of the ocean. Where such forward defenses don’t succeed and cable repairs need to be made, especially in contested waters, partners can protect repair ships in the short term and prevent and eliminate threats as they arise. Increased redundancy in sensitive areas, combined with more ex-China repair capacity, including expanding their fleets of cable-laying ships, could decrease downtimes and build on Washington’s Cable Security Program, which authorized and subsidized U.S. repair ships. Meanwhile, streamlined permitting processes could speed up repairs and build-outs, which once took under 12 months, but can now last for more than three years because of a complex regulatory environment that requires engagement with multiple levels of government, often with uncertain and competing priorities. An improved regulatory environment can also speed up innovation, which may help build more resilient, diversified cable networks. In the next few years, alternatives to subsea cables—such as satellites and other space-based systems such as satellites in low-earth orbit—have shown promise, though they currently have less capacity than subsea cable networks and are still vulnerable to natural and humanmade disasters. Still, such options, bolstered by a growing private-sector space industry, may provide new data transmission options and backups in certain sectors. Indeed, a NATO-funded project launched in July 2024 aims to reroute more internet traffic to space, in case of infrastructure disruptions on Earth. And when the two subsea cables connecting Taiwan with the Matsu Islands were disconnected in January, the backup microwave systems were activated almost instantly. Still, such measures currently provide only limited bandwidth. That may suffice for a country’s sparsely populated outlying islands, but it would likely fall short in urban areas or when it comes to high-volume, low-latency data centers. There is no comprehensive backup for the world’s subsea cable networks. But the seabed, like the surface, is not as peaceful as it once was. A lesson of the 2020s so far has been that when deterrence—whether by denial, punishment, or entanglement—fails in one domain, it can soon collapse elsewhere. That’s also true beneath the waves.",The AI Economy’s Massive Vulnerability,Jared Cohen,Foreign Policy,2025-02-20T06:00:46,2025-02-20T16:37:08,gemini-2.0-flash

https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2025-02-21/canada-declares-mexican-drug-cartels-tren-de-aragua-ms-13-terrorist-entities/,"Toronto, Canada (EFE).- Canada announced the designation of seven Latin American criminal organizations as terrorist groups, five Mexican drug cartels, Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, and El Salvador’s MS-13. On Thursday, Canada’s Public Safety Minister David McGuinty made the announcement in Ottawa, a day after United States President Donald Trump’s administration added Tren de Aragua, MS-13, the Sinaloa, Jalisco Nueva Generación, Noroeste, Gulf, Nueva Familia Michoacana and Unidos cartels to its list of terrorist groups. Canada included the same cartels, except for the Noroeste cartel. In addition to the seven Latin American criminal organizations, Canada considers 86 groups to be terrorists, including Spain’s ETA, Peru’s Sendero Luminoso, the US Proud Boys, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Palestine’s Hamas, and the United Kingdom’s Aryan Strikeforce. On Thursday, Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum announced two constitutional reforms to protect the country from foreign interference in response to Trump’s decision to declare drug cartels terrorists. McGuinty said at a news conference that “transnational criminal organizations, including cartels, play a leading role in the production and distribution of fentanyl throughout Canada,” so the government had decided to declare them terrorist groups to give law enforcement “every resource available.” McGuinty denied it was an action coordinated with the US government. “Canada is a sovereign, independent country. The decision to include (criminal organizations) is sovereign and independent. The reason is to keep our communities safe,” the Canadian minister said. Listing the cartels as terrorist organizations will freeze the assets and property of these groups in Canada and prevent Canadian citizens or residents from doing business with them.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/polish-anti-corruption-chief-resigns-amid-pegasus-scandal/,"WARSAW - Polish PM Donald Tusk has accepted the resignation of Agnieszka Kwiatkowska-Gurdak, head of the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (CBA), as the investigation into the Pegasus surveillance case continues. According to the justice ministry, nearly 600 people were targeted in Poland with Pegasus spyware between 2017 and 2022 under the former ruling PiS (ECR) party. Parliament is investigating the matter. “Resignation accepted,” Tusk (PO, EPP) wrote on X on Thursday afternoon, without giving a name. Earlier media reports suggested that Tusk was waiting for urgent clarifications regarding Kwiatkowska-Gurdak's recent testimony before the parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. During the public part of Tuesday's hearing, the CBA chief argued that she could not disclose most of the information in that setting, citing operational secrecy and the confidentiality of ongoing criminal proceedings. Tusk subsequently lifted her gag order, but members of the investigative committee criticised Kwiatkowska-Gurdak for what they saw as an overly broad interpretation of her right to withhold information. They argued that she had unnecessarily limited the scope of her testimony while in possession of relevant details. The deputy head of the commission, Marcin Bosacki (PO, EPP), stated that the CBA chief could have said more and that she had “interpreted too broadly her right not to inform the commission about the knowledge she possesses.” Shortly after the hearing, Tusk requested an urgent annual report on the CBA from Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak, under whose ministry the CBA falls. The resignation was confirmed on X by the spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior. ""On February 20, 2025, the head of the CBA, Ms. Agnieszka Kwiatkowska-Gurdak, submitted her resignation from her position to the Prime Minister Donald Tusk [...]. The resignation was accepted,"" the spokesman wrote on X. He added that Kwiatkowska-Gurdak will be replaced by Tomasz Strzelczyk, who was previously her deputy. Tusk's acceptance of the CBA chief's resignation was met with criticism from the PiS, which accused the prime minister of punishing her for wanting to remain impartial. ""Is this a Prime Minister? To win applause from his own fanatics, he boasts on X that he forced the head of a service to resign - just because she refused to take part in the political circus that its participants call a 'committee,'"" PiS MP and party international secretary Radosław Fogiel replied to Tusk's post on X. Tusk's government has promised to address the Pegasus scandal – one of the controversies of the PiS government – and hold those responsible accountable after it replaced PiS in power in December 2023.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyew21yyjzo,"An Indian pharmaceutical company is manufacturing unlicensed, highly addictive opioids and exporting them illegally to West Africa where they are driving a major public health crisis in countries including Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire, a BBC Eye investigation has revealed. Aveo Pharmaceuticals, based in Mumbai, makes a range of pills that go under different brand names and are packaged to look like legitimate medicines. But all contain the same harmful mix of ingredients: tapentadol, a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant so addictive it's banned in Europe. This combination of drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world and can cause breathing difficulties and seizures. An overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular as street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. The BBC World Service found packets of them, branded with the Aveo logo, for sale on the streets of Ghanaian, Nigerian, and Ivoirian towns and cities. Having traced the drugs back to Aveo's factory in India, the BBC sent an undercover operative inside the factory, posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria. Using a hidden camera, the BBC filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria ""who all love this product"". Sharma doesn't flinch. ""OK,"" he replies, before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can ""relax"" and agrees they can get ""high"". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: ""This is very harmful for the health,"" adding ""nowadays, this is business."" It is a business that is damaging the health and destroying the potential of millions of young people across West Africa. In the city of Tamale, in northern Ghana, so many young people are taking illegal opioids that one of the city's chiefs, Alhassan Maham, has created a voluntary task force of about 100 local citizens whose mission is to raid drug dealers and take these pills off the streets. ""The drugs consume the sanity of those who abuse them,"" says Maham, ""like a fire burns when kerosene is poured on it."" One addict in Tamale put it even more simply. The drugs, he said, have ""wasted our lives"". The BBC team followed the task force as they jumped on to motorbikes and, following a tip off about a drug deal, launched a raid in one of Tamale's poorest neighbourhoods. On the way they passed a young man slumped in a stupor who, according to locals, had taken these drugs. When the dealer was caught, he was carrying a plastic bag filled with green pills labelled Tafrodol. The packets were stamped with the distinctive logo of Aveo Pharmaceuticals. It's not just in Tamale that Aveo's pills are causing misery. The BBC found similar products, made by Aveo, have been seized by police elsewhere in Ghana. We also found evidence that Aveo's pills are for sale on the streets of Nigeria and Cote D'Ivoire, where teenagers dissolve them in an alcoholic energy drink to increase the high. Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, is shipping millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics. The Chairman of Nigeria's Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa, told the BBC, opioids are ""devastating our youths, our families, it's in every community in Nigeria"". In 2018, following a BBC Africa Eye investigation into the sale of opioids as street drugs, Nigerian authorities tried to get a grip on a widely abused opioid painkiller called tramadol. The government banned the sale of tramadol without prescription, imposed strict limits on the maximum dose, and cracked down on imports of illegal pills. At the same time, Indian authorities tightened export regulations on tramadol. Not long after this crackdown, Aveo Pharmaceuticals began to export a new pill based on tapentadol, an even stronger opioid, mixed with the muscle-relaxant carisoprodol. West African officials are warning that opioid exporters appear to be using these new combination pills as a substitute for tramadol and to evade the crackdown. In the Aveo factory there were cartons of the combination drugs stacked on top of each other, almost ceiling-high. On his desk, Vinod Sharma laid out packet after packet of the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail pills that the company markets under a range of names including Tafrodol, the most popular, as well as TimaKing and Super Royal-225. He told the BBC's undercover team that ""scientists"" working in his factory could combine different drugs to ""make a new product"". People outside the UK canwatch the documentary on YouTube. Aveo's new product is even more dangerous than the tramadol it has replaced. According to Dr Lekhansh Shukla, assistant professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bengaluru, India, tapentadol ""gives the effects of an opioid"" including very deep sleep. ""It could be deep enough that people don't breathe, and that leads to drug overdose,"" he explained. ""And along with that, you are giving another agent, carisoprodol, which also gives very deep sleep, relaxation. It sounds like a very dangerous combination."" Carisoprodol has been banned in Europe because it is addictive. It is approved for use in the US but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, and hallucinations. When mixed with tapentadol the withdrawal is even ""more severe"" compared to regular opioids, said Dr Shukla. ""It's a fairly painful experience."" He said he knew of no clinical trials on the efficacy of this combination. Unlike tramadol, which is legal for use in limited doses, the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail ""does not sound like a rational combination"", he said. ""This is not something that is licensed to be used in our country."" In India, pharmaceutical companies cannot legally manufacture and export unlicensed drugs unless these drugs meet the standards of the importing country. Aveo ships Tafrodol and similar products to Ghana, where this combination of tapentadol and carisoprodol is, according to Ghana's national Drug Enforcement Agency, unlicensed and illegal. By shipping Tafrodol to Ghana, Aveo is breaking Indian law. We put these allegations to Vinod Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals. They did not respond. The Indian drugs regulator, the CDSCO, told us the Indian government recognises its responsibility towards global public health and is committed to ensuring India has a responsible and strong pharmaceutical regulatory system. It added that exports from India to other countries are closely monitored and that recently tightened regulation is strictly enforced. It also called importing countries to support India's efforts by ensuring they had similarly strong regulatory systems. The CDSCO stated it has taken up the matter with other countries, including those in West Africa, and is committed to working with them to prevent wrongdoing. The regulator said it will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice. Aveo is not the only Indian company making and exporting unlicensed opioids. Publicly available export data suggest other pharma companies manufacture similar products, and drugs with different branding are widely available across West Africa. These manufacturers are damaging the reputation of India's fast-growing pharmaceutical industry, which makes high-quality generic medicines upon which millions of people worldwide depend and manufactures vaccines which have saved millions of lives. The industry's exports are worth at least $28bn (Â£22bn) a year. Speaking about his meeting with Sharma, the BBC's undercover operative, whose identity must remain concealed for his safety, says: ""Nigerian journalists have been reporting on this opioid crisis for more than 20 years but finally, I was face to face… with one of the men at the root of Africa's opioid crisis, one of the men who actually makes this product and ships it into our countries by the container load. He knew the harm it was doing but he didn't seem to care… describing it simply as business."" Back in Tamale, Ghana, the BBC team followed the local task force on one final raid that turned up even more of Aveo's Tafrodol. That evening they gathered in a local park to burn the drugs they had seized. ""We are burning it in an open glare for everybody to see,"" said Zickay, one of the leaders, as the packets were doused in petrol and set ablaze, ""so it sends a signal to the sellers and the suppliers: if they get you, they'll burn your drugs"". But even as the flames destroyed a few hundred packets of Tafrodol, the ""sellers and suppliers"" at the top of this chain, thousands of miles away in India, were churning out millions more - and getting rich on the profits of misery.",BBC undercover filming exposes Indian pharma firm fuelling opioid crisis,BBC Eye Investigations,BBC News,2025-02-20T19:53:54,2025-02-20T19:53:54,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/02/21/2003832237,"Democratic nations must band together to counter consolidating authoritarian powers and build “non-red” supply chains, President William Lai (賴清德) said at the opening of the two-day Halifax International Security Forum (HFX) yesterday. Taiwan occupies a critical position in the first island chain, safeguarding national sovereignty, maintaining a democratic way of life, and defending peace and security in the Taiwan Strait while facing authoritarian threats directly, Lai said at the event, which is being held in Taipei for the first time. Taiwan will uphold “peace through strength,” he added. As a responsible member of the international community, Taiwan will not provoke conflicts and will maintain the “status quo” in the Taiwan Strait, while being willing to engage in dialogue with China under the principles of equality and dignity, he said. The government has proposed increasing defense spending to more than 3 percent of GDP and established the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee last year, which is to pursue global peace by deepening relations with democratic allies and improving their defense resilience, he said. Technological strength, being the backbone of national defense, is key to deterring the expansion of authoritarianism, while it is also crucial to improve economic resilience by boosting industrial development, he said. As a country with a leading position in the semiconductor industry, Taiwan is willing to work with democratic allies to build a “non-red supply chain” to pursue mutual economic benefits and maintain global peace, he said. HFX president Peter van Praagh said that the forum being held in Taipei demonstrated the support of the international community for Taiwan. “Taiwan is a vital democracy whose continued freedom and security is important not only to the people of Taiwan, but to the security of the entire world,” Van Praagh told a news conference before the event. It is the first time that the forum is being held outside North America since it was launched in 2009 and it is not a coincidence that it is held in Taiwan, which is a vibrant democratic country facing potential aggression from its neighbor using “gray zone” tactics, Van Praagh said. The aim of the forum is to explore how international society should cope with the situation and most importantly what Taiwan can do, he said. “Through HFX Taipei, I wanted to bring democracies to Taipei to see and understand why Taiwan deserves the international community’s friendship and support,” Van Praagh added. He thanked United Microelectronics Corp (聯電) founder Robert Tsao (曹興誠), who also gave a speech, for his support. Asked how US President Donald Trump’s stance toward the Ukraine war could affect Taiwan, Tsao said that Taiwan could unite and demonstrate its determination to safeguard democracy, despite not being able to predict what Trump would do. The US will not help a country where 60 percent of its people support unification, so Taiwan should “help itself before expecting help from others,” Tsao said. The international society views Taiwan as a whole, despite its internal differences, he said, adding that no political struggle should sacrifice Taiwan’s sovereignty and international status. In his speech, Tsao thanked the forum for excluding China’s participation and not bowing to its pressure by including Taiwan. The event features on-and-off-the-record speeches by former government officials and academics from more than 70 countries, including former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and Akie Abe, former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe’s widow, on issues concerning democracy, security, resilience and partnership, the organizers said.

The hearing has been set for 2 p.m. Tuesday, and the legal teams of the National Assembly and Yoon will each be asked to present their closing arguments, while the parliament and the president will each be asked to give their final statements, acting court President Moon Hyung-bae said during the 10th hearing. The date of the final hearing increases the chances of a verdict in mid-March, as former Presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Park Geun-hye received their impeachment rulings about two weeks after their final hearings. The court will decide whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate him following his impeachment by the National Assembly over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December. Yoon has been accused of violating the Constitution and laws by declaring martial law without valid grounds. The president has countered that his action was a legitimate act of governance meant to send a warning to opposition parties over what he described as their abuse of legislative power. Yoon's lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, relayed a message from the president at a rally of his supporters in central Seoul. ""I will quickly return to duty and lead the Republic of Korea with the power of intergenerational unity,"" he was quoted as saying. If Yoon is ousted, the country will be required to hold a snap presidential election within 60 days. At Thursday's hearing, the court heard testimony from three witnesses -- impeached Prime Minister Han Duck-soo; Hong Jang-won, former first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service; and Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the National Police Agency. Han said he and other Cabinet members were concerned about Yoon's martial law plan and attempted to dissuade him before he announced it on Dec. 3. ""As I recall, all (Cabinet members) were concerned and tried to dissuade him,"" Han said, referring to a hastily arranged meeting of some Cabinet ministers shortly before Yoon's surprise imposition of martial law. When asked about former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun's testimony that some members were in favor of Yoon's plan, Han replied, ""From what I recall, that was not the case at all."" Hong, the former intelligence official, was grilled by Yoon's lawyers about the credibility of a memo he claims to have taken during a phone call with a military commander on the night of Dec. 3 to list the politicians and others the president allegedly wanted arrested. Cho, the police chief, declined to answer most questions, citing his own criminal trial on insurrection charges related to the martial law bid.(END)",(2nd LD) Final hearing of Yoon's impeachment trial to be held next week; verdict likely in mid-March,"Lee Haye-ah, Yi Wonju",Yonhap News Agency,2025-02-20T22:19:34,2025-02-20T22:19:34,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-norway-defense-pact-arctic-russia-undersea-cables-war-ukraine/,"The U.K. and Norway began negotiations Thursday on a defense deal aimed at countering the threat from Russia in the Arctic. British Defense Secretary John Healey met his Norwegian counterpart Tore Sandvik at the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, a fortress tunneled deep into the side of a mountain near the northern town of Bodø just above the Arctic Circle. The defense agreement will see closer working between the two nations' armed forces, including protecting undersea cables from sabotage. Since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ships traveling to or from Russian ports have been suspected of severing key European infrastructure links — whether by accident or sabotage — particularly in the Baltic Sea. Healey said: “Norway remains one of the U.K.’s most important allies. We will create a new era of defense partnership to bring us closer than ever before as we tackle increasing threats, strengthen NATO, and boost our security in the High North. “The U.K. is determined to play a leadership role on European security, supporting the foundations for our security and prosperity at home and showing our adversaries that we are united in our determination to protect our interests.” The defense secretary's comments come as tensions between the U.S. and Europe over Ukrainian peace negotiations escalate. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed Russia ""have the cards"" in talks and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ""dictator"" for not holding elections in wartime. The U.S. has also argued European NATO members must spend more on defense, with the U.K. working toward allocating 2.5 percent of GDP to its military capabilities. Healey said Tuesday the British Ministry of Defense would undergo its “biggest defense shake up in 50 years” to ensure it was ready for war. When meeting Norwegian troops patrolling the border with Russia Wednesday, Healey said he was ""really interested"" they had conscription, which isn't the case in the U.K. Healey's visit followed a Russian spy ship entering U.K. waters in January and last November.

https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-democratic-party-disbands-2ca9c8700b4f62335e9c7608d7172f99,"HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy party took an initial step toward dissolving Thursday, in the latest sign of the Chinese territory’s narrowing space for civil society groups following Beijng’s crackdown on dissent. The Democratic Party’s central committee decided to set up a task force to look into the procedures involved in dissolving the party. A final decision would require approval of the party’s members. Party Chairperson Lo Kin-hei said at a news conference late Thursday that party leaders made the decision based the current political situation and social climate, and said the party did not have any acute financial burdens. “When we have to move toward this direction, we, of course, feel it is a pity. I believe every member cherishes the existence of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong,” he said. Founded in 1994, the Democratic Party is one of the few pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong, where political activism has faced a stern crackdown from China’s central government in Beijing following anti-government protests by Hong Kongers in 2019. Its prominent party members include Martin Lee, nicknamed the city’s “Father of Democracy,” Albert Ho, former leader of a now-defunct group that organized Tiananmen vigils, and journalist-turned-activist Emily Lau. Over the years, the party has long been seen as a moderate opposition party that once maintained friendly relationships even with Beijing officials. Some of its former members had become top government officials, while radical members had criticized the party for being too mild. Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. But following the massive protests that rocked the Chinese territory in 2019, the city’s political environment changed drastically. Months of social unrest triggered Beijing to impose a national security law — which authorities insist is necessary for the city’s stability. Since the law took effect in 2020, dozens of civil society groups have shut down, including the city’s once second-largest pro-democracy party and a decades-old group that organized the annual vigil to commemorate Beijing’s Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. Many leading activists were prosecuted under the law, including members of the Democratic Party. Others were forced into self-exile or silenced. Last year, some of the party’s former lawmakers were convicted and sentenced over their roles in an unofficial primary election in the city’s largest national security case. That verdict drew criticism from foreign governments though Beijing defended it. In recent years, the party has had limited influence over the city’s politics after the authorities overhauled the electoral rules in changes they said ensured that “patriots” administered Hong Kong, and that effectively barred pro-democracy candidates from running for seats in district councils. Despite the changing climate, the party pressed on with its work. It continued holding news briefings on livelihood issues and even submitted opinions on proposed national security legislation to the government before the law was enacted last March. In Thursday’s news conference, Lo said disbandment would require support from 75% of the attending members of a general assembly. The party now has 400 members, but typically not all members attend general meetings. In the past, the party has had both successful and failed attempts to secure enough votes to change its constitution, he said. When the former British colony was returned to China’s rule in 1997, the governing principle of “one country, two systems” was supposed to guarantee Western-style civil liberties and autonomy not enjoyed by mainland Chinese territories. But Lo said his party’s interpretation of this governing principle may differ from that of the Hong Kong government. He said he hoped these different views could remain in society, saying that societies improve only with diverse voices. “The path to democracy is always difficult,” Lo said. “I have confidence in Hong Kongers and Hong Kongers can always find ways to handle different matters.”",Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy party takes initial step toward disbanding,KANIS LEUNG,AP News,2025-02-20T16:30:36,2025-02-20T12:12:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-modi-uk-india-trade-talks-new-delhi/,"LONDON — Just days before the U.K. is set to officially restart trade talks with India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi threw open the doors of parliament for a VIP visitor: former British PM Rishi Sunak. Sunak, who has kept a low-profile since last July’s election defeat, was given the full prime ministerial treatment — touring the halls of parliament, meeting senior ministers and taking the nation’s media by storm, with his visit splashed across New Delhi Television, the Hindustan Times, and the Indian Express. While still prime minister, Sunak failed to land a trade deal with India ahead of the summer election, despite ministers and officials saying Modi’s government was keen to put pen to paper. He refused to make concessions in sensitive areas like social security and visas, instead pushing for a broader, deeper deal.  But now the former British leader, who remains an MP, has been making amends ahead of Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds’ trip next week to officially begin talks. Modi, reunited with Sunak, took to X to call him a “great friend of India,” who is “passionate about even stronger India-U.K. ties.” Sunak, who visited Modi with his family — including his mother-in-law, Sudha Murthy, co-founder of Indian tech giant, Infosys — also met with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Jaishankar posted on X to say it was “nice to meet” Sunak, and he “appreciate[s] his constant support for strengthening relations.” ‘Complex’ talks ahead A U.K. official, granted anonymity to speak candidly, was quick to stress that Sunak wasn’t working on the U.K. government’s behalf. But the official noted it was common for politicians and business leaders to use their personal networks to support and advocate for closer economic ties. They also highlighted that standard protocol would have been followed to support the former PM while traveling.  Meanwhile, Trade Secretary Reynolds is gearing up for his own trip to India. He is due to fly out this Sunday, with Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson also scheduled to arrive early next week. Gustafsson will attend the U.K.-India AI Conference, hosted at the headquarters of Infosys, the Indian tech firm owned by Sunak’s in-laws. A person close to Sunak insisted the former prime minister has no involvement with Infosys and that his meetings weren’t about the free trade agreement. Trade negotiations between the U.K. and India — which kicked off under Boris Johnson in April 2022  — are now back on the agenda under Keir Starmer's Labour government. Speaking to journalists earlier this month, Reynolds was hopeful. “We are committed to the Indian trade deal,” he said. “Obviously no trade negotiation is an easy one [and it is] a particularly complex one with an economy the size of India, but I’m really optimistic about it.”",Rishi Sunak jets in to smooth relations ahead of UK-India trade talks,"Caroline Hug, Dan Bloom",POLITICO,2025-02-20T12:50:43,2025-02-20T13:17:20,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250220-%F0%9F%94%B4-france-returns-sole-military-base-to-ivory-coast,"France on Thursday handed its sole Ivory Coast military base back to its former colony. France has been present in the country for decades, and its departure is in line with a growing trend among African countries to reduce their military ties with France. The French and Ivorian defence ministers signed a document to confirm the return, shortly after the Ivorian flag was raised in the base’s parade ground. Though the handover comes as a spate of France’s former colonies in west Africa weaken ties with their former imperial ruler, both sides stressed that relations remained warm. “This act marks a new era in the friendship and strategic collaboration between our two countries,” Ivorian Defence Minister Tene Birahima Ouattara said. His French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu said that as “the world is changing... it’s obvious that our military relationship should change”. Lecornu hailed the base’s handover as a “historic moment” for the two countries, who share “a relationship built on friendship and a high level of professionalism”. “The presence of France is changing, but not disappearing,” he said. Ouattara also said he wanted to “reassure” France that military cooperation between the two countries would be “as good as it has always been” in the future. A changing of the guard took place at the beginning of the ceremony to mark the transfer of security responsibilities to the Ivorian army. In the last few weeks, around 100 Ivorian paratroopers have also moved into the camp, and joint exercises took place between the two armies.

Ivory Coast has remained an anomaly in France’s relationship with Africa, maintaining links with its former colonial master since its independence in 1960, despite a decade of crisis in the 2000s. Elsewhere in the region France is revamping military relations with African nations after the forced departure of its troops from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, where military-led governments hostile to Paris have seized power. In November, Senegal and Chad also announced within hours of each other that they would bring France’s military presence in their countries to an end. Many of those governments have stressed the importance of sovereignty and questioned the need for France’s continued presence in their countries. “The Ivorian authorities know very well that there is support for sovereignty in the country, so the French military departure is something that should happen before it becomes a mainstream demand,” Ivorian political analyst Geoffroy Kouao told AFP. The French withdrawal will take place gradually over the course of 2025, but around 80 French soldiers are expected to remain for training and support missions. “Paris will remain a valued partner in training, intelligence and especially in the fight against terrorism,” Geoffroy Kouao said. The 230-hectare (570-acre) Port-Bouet military camp flanking Ivory Coast’s largest city of Abidjan has been a fixture in the country’s life since 1978 and helped stabilise the world’s top cocoa producer after coups and unrest broke out in the nation after the turn of the millennium. In 2002, following an attempted coup against then-president Laurent Gbagbo and the takeover of part of the country by rebels, France put in place the Licorne (Unicorn) force to protect French nationals and to try to stabilise the country. In April 2011, this force, alongside the United Nations, carried out bombings on Gbagbo’s residence, after several months of post-election crisis. The mission wound up in 2015.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/02/20/2003832180,"The UN nuclear watchdog chief yesterday visited Japan’s stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, a day after Tokyo approved an energy plan that marks a return to nuclear power. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is monitoring Japan’s efforts to decommission the Fukushima plant after a 2011 earthquake-triggered tsunami killed 18,000 people and set off the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. As IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi arrived in Japan on Tuesday, the Cabinet adopted a plan to increase reliance on nuclear power to help meet growing energy demand from artificial intelligence (AI) and microchip factories. “At a moment where Japan is embarking on a gradual return to nuclear energy in its national energy mix, it is important that this is also done in complete safety and with the confidence of the society,” Grossi said after meeting Japan’s foreign minister. Japan had previously vowed to “reduce reliance on nuclear power as much as possible.” However, the pledge was dropped from the latest Strategic Energy Plan — which includes an intention to make renewables the country’s top power source by 2040. Under the plan, nuclear power would account for about 20 percent of Japan’s energy supply by 2040, up from 5.6 percent in 2022. The shift back to nuclear power comes as Japan contends with how to remove about 880 tonnes of radioactive debris from the Fukushima Dai-ichi reactors. So far, only one tiny sample has been retrieved by a robotic claw. Grossi, making his fifth visit to Fukushima, viewed the vast “interim” contaminated soil storage facilities near the plant for the first time. About 13 million cubic meters of soil — enough to fill 10 stadiums — was scraped from the region to remove radiation. About 300,000m3 of ash from incinerated organic material is also being stored. Reporters yesterday saw trucks and construction vehicles going back and forth between several spots where hundreds of large soil-filled black bags were stacked. Japan plans to recycle about 75 percent of the soil — the portion with low radioactivity — for building projects such as road and railway embankments. The remaining material would be disposed of outside the Fukushima region ahead of a 2045 deadline. “In terms of the timing, which has been, of course, set by law for 2045, we believe that it is not unrealistic. It can be done,” Grossi told reporters yesterday.",IAEA official visits Fukushima; Japan revives nuclear power,"AFP, FUKUSHIMA DAI-ICHI NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, Japan",台北時報,2025-02-20T00:00:00,2025-02-19T23:40:13,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250219004300315,"SEOUL, Feb. 19 (Yonhap) -- One of the two North Korean soldiers captured by Ukraine has expressed his wish to go to South Korea, a news report said Wednesday, in what would be the first known case for a North Korean captive to voice an intent to defect to the South. A North Korean solider, identified only by his surname Ri, said in an interview with the Chosun Ilbo that he never knew he would engage in combat against Ukraine as he was told that he would be sent to Russia for training as an overseas student. ""I have made up my mind 80 percent ... Above all, I will seek refuge and am thinking about going to the Republic of Korea (ROK). If I apply for asylum, would they take me?"" Ri said, when asked about his plan for the future. Ri is one of the two wounded North Korean soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces last month during combat against Ukraine in Russia's Kursk region. It marked the first time that a North Korean solider captured by Ukraine has expressed an intent to defect to South Korea since North Korea sent around 11,000 troops to support Russia in its war against Ukraine. Ri, born in 1999 and served as a scout sniper in North Korea, said he belongs to the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North's intelligence agency. ""(Officials from the North's state security ministry) said pilots of the Ukrainian military's drones are all ROK soldiers,"" Ri said, adding that he engaged in combat with Ukraine while believing he was fighting against South Korean troops. Ri, who sustained serious wounds to his jaw and arm, said almost all his comrades from a military unit were killed due to Ukraine's drones and artillery attacks. He also said he could have tried to blow himself up if he had a grenade because being held prisoner in North Korea amounts to a betrayal. As a North Korean solider captured by Ukraine has expressed his wish to defect, what draws attention will be whether the South Korean government would kick off consultations with Ukraine over the issue. South Korea's Constitution stipulates that the entire Korean Peninsula is defined as its territory, effectively recognizing all residents on the peninsula as its nationals. ""As North Korean soldiers are our nationals according to the Constitution, (the government) plans to hold discussions with Ukraine if they request defection to South Korea,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Lee Jae-woong told a press briefing last month. The National Intelligence Service, Seoul's spy agency, also cast a similar stance during a parliamentary session in January that what intent North Korean prisoners have is very important. But it remains unknown whether the process to bring such North Korean captives to South Korea would be smooth, as the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War (POWs) stipulates that POWs shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities. Some experts, however, argue that the North's case may be an exception to such a repatriation duty in accordance with the 2020 commentary by the International Committee of the Red Cross, given that Ri could face a ""real risk"" of serious human rights violations if he is sent back to North Korea. sooyeon@yna.co.kr(END)",1 of 2 N.

https://www.jpost.com/international/article-842904,"“We are not daunted. We will not be deterred. We will speak in defense of our national interests.” These words from South African PresidentCyril Ramaphosa’s February 6 State of a Nation Address illustrate Pretoria’s defiance in a rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape. His country is at the center of global controversy: accused of human rights violations by the Trump administration, leading a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), defending Russia, strengthening ties with China, and reportedly taking Iranian money. The big question: what actually guidesSouth Africa’s foreign policy? Conviction, strategy, or cold, hard cash? JPost Videos South Africa insists it is a non-aligned democracy, yet its actions suggest otherwise. Particularly in its decision to partner with Iranian and Qatari-funded legal teams to prosecute Israel at the ICJ – drawing ire from Washington. “When you side with terrorists at an international body also used by dictatorships and tyrannies to target the US and deflect attention from their own misdeeds, you’re not a moral superpower. You’re on the wrong side of morality,” says Joel Pollak, a South African-American senior editor at the conservative-leaning media outlet Breitbart News. Meanwhile, US-South Africa tensions are escalating. PresidentDonald Trumphas threatened to cut aid, citing land reform policies denounced as “racist” by white farmers and the White House. He has also slapped new tariffs on Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – the BRICS nations – warning them against ditching the US dollar – rattling investors. “There are American investors who are very unhappy with what South Africa is doing, which affects not just land but all property rights,” notes Pollak, who is also poised to become Trump’s new envoy to the African country. Pretoria may also risk losing access to its trade benefits under the US African Growth and Opportunity Act, which drives billions into its economy. South Africa’s drift toward China and Russia is further alienating Washington. Still, South Africa remains America’s largest trading partner on the continent. Pollak warns that warming up to anti-Western states could jeopardize that. “The US wouldn’t notice if trade with South Africa disappeared. It does not need rare earth minerals anymore from them when it has begun discovering them at home.” South Africa didn’t have to look far for another ally – Iran came to them. Vuyolwethu Mkhuseli Xulu, a South African social science strategist and ANC member, explains: “Iran has been seeking legitimacy. Even among Arab nations, it’s an outlier. South Africa, with its Mandela legacy, gives it credibility.” Pretoria’s growing relations with Iran are transparent: it praises Tehran for supporting its ICJ case, condemns Israeli strikes on Iran, and ignores its military and nuclear expansion. Behind closed doors, Iran’s influence runs even deeper. “A lot of business dealings are happening between South Africa and Iran, who many see for its historic opposition to Apartheid’s Western backers. However, reveals Xulu, “many ANC constituents aren’t even aware of these deals because they have become a top-down transaction.” Considering South Africa’s crippling energy crisis, oil-centric Tehran should be an obvious trade partner – but Xulu highlights contradictions here as well. “We thought closer ties with Iran were about energy security, but we’re not investing in green energy. Iran’s crude oil doesn’t align with our government’s supposed push for sustainability.” For him, the real motive is ANC survival. “The party is being opportunistic. They need capital,” he says, pointing to the significant loss of its outright majority, for the first time since the fall of Apartheid, now ruling only through a coalition. “They know they are losing support even from within the movement.” “There was a huge internal fight over the ICJ case and our assumed neutrality” posits Xulu, who is also a research fellow at ISGAP, which exposed Iranian and Qatari funding behind the court’s probe. He notes the hypocrisy of his party “who once distrusted these institutions, now championing them” but maintains that it is a double-edged sword as “ANC leaders are now suspending or removing members who push back.” Contrary to popular belief, China’s relationship with South Africa goes beyond economics. Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project, argues: “There’s nothing exceptional about South Africa’s ties with China that prioritizes business over politics. In fact, the ANC and the Chinese Communist Party have one of the strongest party-to-party relationships in Africa.” This diplomatic viewpoint was on display when Beijing not only supported Pretoria’s ICJ case against Israel but also urged a condemnation of its “occupation” of Palestinian territories. Although it reinforced a shared anti-Western stance, it clashed with South Africa’s democratic model. As Olander puts it: “South Africa backs China’s position not because it agrees, but because siding with Beijing costs them nothing politically while winning favor with a UN Security Council power.” Beijing, in turn, uses these alliances to reshape the current world order, offering governing alternatives to Western-led institutions like the World Bank and the IMF through BRICS, the Belt and Road Initiative, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Still, China dominates South Africa’s trade, which accounts for 20% of Beijing’s total trade with the continent. However, unlike poorer African nations, Pretoria is not dependent on Chinese loans. “South Africa doesn’t receive much infrastructure financing nor does it borrow from China – it has other ways to access capital,” says Olander. Pretoria’s edging closer to the Russia-China-Iran axis may appear threatening to Washington. While it could benefit “enormously” from other African nations, “severing ties with the US would cause unspeakable economic damage, but South Africa’s political standing in the Global South would surge.” South Africa’s relations with Russia trace back to the Soviet Union’s support for the ANC’s liberation struggle. That historic loyalty lingers, but as Steven Gruzd, head of the Russia-Africa Project at the South African Institute of International Affairs notes: “Russia today is not the Soviet Union, but many ANC members studied there, and those fond memories endure.” Pretoria’s pro-Russian stance is apparent as it refuses to impose sanctions, conducts joint naval drills, abstains on UN Ukraine votes, and parrots Moscow’s NATO proxy war narrative. “Ramaphosa has repeatedly framed Ukraine as a Western-engineered war aimed at undermining Russia. This is in line with Moscow, yet challenges South Africa’s supposed neutrality,” says Gruzd. Unlike its trade surplus with America, South Africa runs a deficit with Russia, which is pushing its own currency in BRICS as a challenge to US hegemony. While Pretoria echoes Moscow’s anti-West rhetoric, Gruzd warns that its lack of economic clout and desperate attempts to balance conflicting alliances, means it remains solely as another pawn on Russia’s global chessboard. All four experts agree on South Africa’s foreign policy leanings. It is not binary but rather a mixture of principle, pragmatism, and pay-to-play – no different from any other member of the G20 or, more broadly, any other nation in the international community, they argue. However, US patience is wearing thin, and Pretoria may soon face a reckoning: ideology or economic survival?For Israel, South Africa is no longer merely a critic – it has become a legal adversary on the world stage. Whether Pretoria’s balancing act will secure its long-term interests or lead to isolation remains to be seen.","Iran, Russia, China: why South Africa is choosing new friends",BATYA LEVINTHAL,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-19T18:38:06,2025-02-20T04:58:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-842893,"In a significant diplomatic development, Hikmet Hajiyev, Assistant to the President ofAzerbaijan, held extensive talks with Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuin Jerusalem on Tuesday, marking what officials describe as a potential ""game-changing moment"" in regional politics. ""Mr. Hajiyev conveyed the greetings of President Ilham Aliyev to Prime Minister Netanyahu,"" the Azerbaijani Embassy in Israel stated, adding that both sides discussed expanding bilateral cooperation and regional developments. The high-level meeting, which comes just 48 hours after Netanyahu's strategic dialoguewith US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, signals growing momentum for Azerbaijan's potential inclusion in the Abraham Accords framework, according to diplomatic sources familiar with the discussions. ""Azerbaijan has been one of Israel's most reliable partners in the Muslim world for three decades,"" a senior Israeli official toldThe Jerusalem Post. ""Their strategic importance to regional security architecture cannot be overstated."" The Atlantic Council, a prominent US think tank, recently emphasized that ""Washington should learn from Israelâ	ms diplomatic and security collaboration with Azerbaijan to bolster its own ties with Baku. Besides being a bulwark against Iran, close relations with Azerbaijan could help the United States gain a stronger foothold among Central Asian countries, with whom Azerbaijan has been developing stronger relations. This would be especially important for the United States, as Central Asia is rich in minerals and energy and is home to the Middle Corridor, a trade route from Asia to Europe that bypasses both Russia and Iran"". The same day, the Assistant to the Azerbaijani President arrived in Jerusalem, Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies published a special Prospective Paper called â	”How to Effectively Engage Azerbaijan in Trumpâ	ms Regional Plans and in Israelâ	ms Interests: Practical Recommendationsâ	”. It points out that Israel and pro-Israel forces in the US should actively advocate for Azerbaijanâ	ms inclusion in American-Israeli regional development, investment, and technology partnerships. Israel is already advancing a trilateral partnership model for Morocco, involving American companies, and plans to extend this approach to Sunni Gulf monarchies and the US in defense, AI, and cybersecurity as part of the Abraham Accords expansion. Azerbaijanâ	ms participation in such initiatives would strengthen the Muslim component of Israelâ	ms regional partnerships. Moreover, this fully aligns with the Trump administrationâ	ms strategy of expanding multilateral cooperation among US allies to reduce Washingtonâ	ms financial burden on regional development and defense projects. The paper highlights a significant obstacle: Section 907, a legislative amendment that has restricted U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan since 1992. ""For the U.S. and Israel to fully leverage Azerbaijan's advantages within the new 'Greater Middle East' architecture, these formal obstacles must be eliminated,"" the report states. Azerbaijan's unique position as a Muslim-majority country with decades-long strategic ties to Israel makes it an attractive partner for expanding the Abraham Accords to Muslim countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, experts say. Several senior officials from Azerbaijanâ	ms Foreign and Economy Ministries have been actively engaged in bilateral relations with Israel for years and could serve as consultants for The Friedman Center for Peace Through Strength and the Abraham Fund as the accords expand. The country has consistently supported Israel during critical periods, including increasing oil exports by 55% during the recent conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah. The timing of Hajiyev's visit, coinciding with renewed US-Israeli coordination on Iran's nuclear program, underscores Azerbaijan's strategic significance. Both Israel and Azerbaijan view the Iranian regime as an existential threat, making their security cooperation particularly valuable in the current geopolitical context. As the Trump administration seeks to reshape regional alliances, Azerbaijan's role in facilitating Israel's integration into the ""Greater Middle East"" could prove crucial, particularly in expanding security and economic cooperation with other Muslim nations.","Azerbaijan’s top adviser meets Netanyahu, sparking Abraham Accords talk",JERUSALEM POST STAFF,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-19T22:07:42,2025-02-19T22:07:42,gemini-2.0-flash

China’s Huaqiao University in Xiamen and Quanzhou, as well as Jinan University in Guangzhou, which have 600 and 1,500 Taiwanese on their rolls respectively, are under direct control of the Chinese government’s political warfare branch, Cheng said, citing reports by national security officials. A comprehensive ban on Taiwanese institutions collaborating or facilitating programs with the two Chinese universities would be announced at an annual meeting with Taiwanese college and university deans, he said. The prohibition would apply to public and private high schools, colleges and universities, and their vocational equivalents nationwide, he said. Any institution that contravenes the order would have their government subsidies withdrawn, Cheng said in reference to private education providers not subordinate to the Ministry of Education. The measure is necessary to prevent China from systematically targeting Taiwanese students with its “united front” work, he said, adding that education providers have an obligation to protect national security. Taiwanese have a constitutional right to education, but the two Chinese universities do not serve an educational role, as shown by the United Front Work Department’s involvement in their affairs, he said. Taiwanese colleges and universities are already forbidden from collaborating with education providers run by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, Cheng said. The Ministry of Education’s authority applies only to the administration of high schools, colleges and universities, not students, who are free to attend any institution they want, he said. The two Chinese universities are continuing their efforts to recruit Taiwanese high-school graduates following the conclusion of this year’s national college entrance examinations, a source said on condition of anonymity. Separately, in July last year, education authorities warned about the risks of participating in Chinese academic events after the Mainland Affairs Council raised its travel advisory for China to “orange.” A source familiar with Huaqiao University said that the institution has “extremely low standards” for Taiwanese applicants and that its graduate programs have a fixed quota for students from Taiwan. Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) caucus whip Fu Kun-chi (傅?萁) studied law at Huaqiao University, the source added. On Tuesday, Taiwanese rapper Chen Po-yuan (陳柏源), who attended Huaqiao University, said that professors there taught “Xi Jinping thought” and criticized the US. “When I applied through a special program [to enroll], Huaqiao University would take any Taiwanese applicant, even if they had not graduated from high school,” said Chen, whose stage name is Mannam PYC (閩南狼).",Taiwan blacklists two Chinese schools,Rachel Lin and Jonathan Chin,Taipei Times,2025-02-20T00:00:00,2025-02-19T23:40:13,gemini-2.0-flash

The North's condemnation came as Australia has made its first payment of US$500 million to the United States over its plan to buy Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines under the trilateral AUKUS security partnership also involving Britain. ""This is not a just financial transaction, but it is the activation of another nuclear alliance led by the U.S. in earnest,"" the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in its commentary. ""The move is a dangerous attempt to further worsen the political and military environment in the Asia-Pacific region that has already remained unstable.""

""Please help us,"" it reads. The hotel offers its clients rooms with sea views, has two exclusive restaurants, a swimming pool, a spa and private transportation. But it has now become a ""temporary custody"" centre housing 299 undocumented migrants deported from the US, the Panamanian government said on Tuesday. Some migrants raise their arms and cross them at the wrists to indicate that they are deprived of their freedom. Others hang small signs with other messages such as: ""We are not safe in our country."" The Trump administration has pledged to deport millions of people who crossed illegally into the US. Those in the Panama City hotel arrived on three flights last week, after President José Raúl Mulino agreed that Panama would become a ""bridge"" country for deportees. However, of the 299 undocumented migrants - from India, China, Uzbekistan, Iran, Vietnam, Turkey, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka - only 171 have agreed to return to their countries of origin. The remainder now face an uncertain future, and it is the Panamanian authorities who are in control of what happens next. According to the government, this group will be transferred to a camp in the province of Darién, which has temporarily housed migrants crossing the jungle en route to the US. On a normal day, tourists can enter and leave the Decápolis Hotel with ease, but now heavily armed members of the Panamanian National Aeronaval Service enforce strict security measures inside and outside of the building. From the street, laundry can be seen hanging in a window. One of the items is a yellow Los Angeles Lakers basketball jersey with the number 24, worn by the legendary player Kobe Bryant. In another window, a group of adults and three children raise their arms with their thumbs in their palms - the international symbol for those needing assistance. ""Help us,"" is written in red letters on the glass. And two children with their faces covered hold up sheets of paper against the glass with the message: ""Please save the Afghan girls."" An Iranian woman who has lived in Panama for a number of years told the BBC she was in contact with one of the migrants inside the hotel. She said they were ""terrified"" of the possibility of being returned to Iran. The woman, who asked not to be named, said she went to the hotel to offer her help as a Farsi translator but was told they already had one. She added, however, that people inside the hotel said that was not true. Using a hidden mobile phone, since contact with those outside of the Decápolis Hotel is reportedly not allowed, the Iranian woman said the migrant told her there were several children in the hotel, that they have been denied a lawyer and that they are not allowed to leave their rooms even to eat. After the story of the deportees being held at the hotel was first reported on Tuesday, the security measures put in place were tightened and migrants' access to the internet was cut off, the woman said. The BBC contacted both the Decápolis Hotel and the Panamanian government to ask about the conditions inside the building, but did not receive a response. However, Panama's Minister of Public Security Frank Ábrego said migrants are not allowed to leave the hotel because his government must guarantee the safety and peace of Panamanians. A video posted on social media on the weekend showed one of the migrants describing in Farsi how they had been detained after crossing the border to the US and told that they would be taken to Texas, but ended up in Panama. The woman in the video said her life would be in danger if she returned to Iran because of possible reprisals of the government. Her intention, she said, is to ask for political asylum. Analysts say this is difficult to obtain without access to a lawyer - even more so when the Panamanian government announced that this access would not be offered to deportees. Minister Ábrego said on Tuesday that the migrants would remain temporarily in Panama under the protection of the country's authorities. ""What we agreed with the US government is that they are here and will remain in our temporary custody for their protection,"" he said. He also warned that those migrants who did not wish to return to their country of origin would have to choose a third country. In that case, he said, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would be responsible for their repatriation. An IOM spokesperson told the BBC that the organisation is in charge of ""providing essential support"" to people deported from the US. ""We are working with local officials to help those affected, supporting the voluntary return of those who request it and identifying safe alternatives for others,"" he said. ""While we have no direct involvement in the detention or restriction of movement of persons, we are committed to ensuring that all migrants are treated with dignity and in accordance with international standards,"" he said. Ábrego also said the migrants were being housed in the Decápolis Hotel because of its capacity to receive them. Another senior official said ""the arrival of more migrants is not expected"" because no more flights of this type have been agreed with the US. Panama agreed to be a ""bridge"" country for deportations after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited the country as tensions simmered over Trump's threats to ""recover"" sovereignty of the Panama Canal. Muzaffar Chishti, a senior researcher at the Migration Policy Institute - a think tank in the US - said many of the deportees come from nations not open to accepting the return of nationals deported from the US. ""That implies constant diplomatic negotiations with those governments,"" he told the BBC. ""By sending them to Panama, the US is out of the picture,"" he added. ""It is a headache for Panama to take charge of those negotiations and see how to get those countries to agree to receive them again."" This week, a flight carrying deportees from the US is expected to arrive in Costa Rica, another Central American country that has agreed with Washington to become a ""bridge"" nation for deportees.

The hearing is scheduled to be held at the Seoul Central District Court at 10 a.m. Thursday, concurrently with a hearing to review Yoon's request to cancel his arrest and release him. ""President Yoon plans to attend the hearing on the request to cancel his arrest,"" Yun Gap-geun, the lawyer, said in a notice to the press. A person close to the president clarified that the two hearings will be held simultaneously. ""It's possible he will state his position,"" the person said. Yoon has been held at a detention center since mid-January after being detained by investigators on charges of inciting an insurrection through his short-lived imposition of martial law in December. A preliminary hearing is held to clarify the main disputes of a case and plan for future proceedings. It does not require the defendant's attendance. Security will be heightened around the court ahead of the proceedings, according to the compound's management. The Seoul District Court Complex said it plans to cordon off some entrances to the court, heighten security checks on visitors and ban the entry of all unregistered vehicles. ""There is a high probability that a large number of people will gather, given the scheduled hearings and multiple reports of assembly,"" the court management said.

But the ANC's main coalition partner, the Democratic Alliance (DA), a traditional rival, has opposed a proposed two-percentage-point increase in value-added tax (VAT) to 17%,""
Â
and the budget has been postponed until March 12. ""I think that it is correct that, when such situations happen, we need to collectively think on the best way forward,"" said Speaker Thoko Didiza, announcing the postponement to lawmakers and describing the situation as ""unprecedented."" DA leader John Steenhuisen welcomed the move, which he said was ""a victory for the people of South Africa."" He claimed the VAT rise would have ""broken the back of our economy."" South Africa's economy has been struggling with rising inflation and notorious inequality. More than 60% of the population is affected by poverty, a situation only exacerbated by recent cuts to aid from theUnited States. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said the government was ""grappling"" with ways to finance its plans. ""There is a general agreement in the current environment that we need to find a way of funding our priorities,"" he told reporters. ""Do we borrow more? Do we cut expenditure? Do we raise taxes?

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-europe-major-plan-industry-clean-industrial-deal-climate-targets-donald-trump/,"BRUSSELS —
The European Commission is planning to introduce “made-in-EU” quotas and carbon product labels as it tries to revive ailing manufacturers while hitting climate targets.

The proposals are laid out in a draft of the Commission's Clean Industrial Deal, obtained by POLITICO ahead of its Feb. 26 unveiling. The document offers the European Union executive’s grand strategy for weaving together the bloc’s efforts to decarbonize and revitalize its heavy industry, setting out the steps it plans to take in the coming years.

The plan lands at a precarious political moment. European manufacturers in sectors such as steel and cement say excessive bureaucracy and high energy costs are leaving them unable to compete with the United States and China. Exacerbating the problem, both Washington and Beijing are spending lavishly on their companies, with new President Donald Trump in particular employing “buy American” rhetoric.
Now, the EU wants to inject a dose of “buy European” into its own climate efforts.
Bringing it back home
The EU executive’s strategy encompasses six pillars: lowering energy prices, creating demand, spurring investment, ensuring access to key materials, working on global partnerships and reskilling workers.

The goal: “Present European industry with a stronger business case for large climate-neutral investments in energy-intensive industries and clean tech.”

The draft places demand-stimulating measures for “made in Europe” climate-friendly goods at the heart of the Clean Industrial Deal, reaffirming an existing goal to make 40 percent of the EU’s key clean technology components within the bloc.

To that end, the Commission wants to set quotas to ensure governments and other public authorities purchase such goods.

The Clean Industrial Deal envisions both “minimum local content requirements” and “resilience and sustainability criteria,” all set by legislation to come later this year. It also says the Commission will revise the EU’s public procurement rules in 2026 to “make European preference criteria a structural feature” for “strategic sectors.”

The rules won’t just apply to public contracts.

“These criteria will also be extended to incentivize private procurement, through measures such as life cycle-based CO2 emission performance standards,” the draft adds.

Another idea in the plan is new product labels for industrial goods to show how much planet-warming carbon dioxide was emitted in the manufacturing process.

In legislation later this year, the Commission promises to develop such labels — which will remain voluntary — for specific sectors, starting with steel “in the interest of speed.” This will not entail additional bureaucratic burdens for industry, the draft stresses, with the label derived from existing carbon market data.
Energizing Europe
Another key part of the strategy is to lower energy prices and boost the rollout of cheaper green energy to replace fossil fuels.

The draft recommends the EU electrify 32 percent of its economy by 2030, up from 23 percent today, and calls for 100 gigawatts of new renewable electricity capacity each year by the same date. As part of this effort, it suggests new legislation accelerating renewable energy permits.
Many of the energy-related measures — including promises of fresh guidance on easing energy taxes and a legal package on electrical grids — are also addressed in an accompanying document, the ""Action Plan for Affordable Energy,"" also obtained by POLITICO.

The EU executive will ask the European Investment Bank, the EU’s lending arm, to help ease up-front investments in needed power grid components and to back long-term industrial energy contracts — though the amount of EIB backing is still undefined in the draft.

The draft also promises “short-term relief … to improve the business case for EU-made clean manufacturing.” The plan says the EU will put money behind the effort, but the amount is left unclear.

On state aid, the document promises simpler rules and separate support programs for specific technologies such as wind and solar, as well as help for clean-tech manufacturing such as batteries.

Another subject in the plan is critical raw materials — the building blocks of energy-efficient and digital technologies. The Commission plans to set up a dedicated ""EU critical raw material centre"" to ""jointly purchase raw materials"" for groups of companies.

It also wants measures to recycle more of these materials and limit exports of raw material waste.
On trade, the Commission proposes to “substantially simplify” its new carbon border tax to reduce bureaucratic burdens, and to look into expanding the measure through a revision this year, followed by a legislative proposal next year.

Plus, it vows that new “Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships” — a mix of regulatory cooperation and financial support “to develop strategic clean value chains with partners” — will “complement” the EU’s free trade agreements with other countries.

The 22-page draft dedicates less than two pages to skills and social issues, focusing mainly on ensuring that industry has access to a skilled workforce.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cre8expj2leo,"Ireland's goods exports to the United States surged by 34% to €72.6bn (£60.4bn) in 2024 while its imports from the US fell slightly to €22.5bn (£18.7bn). That meant Ireland had a goods-trade surplus with the US of just over €50bn (£41.6bn), according to the data from Ireland's Central Statistics Office (CSO). These trade patterns have gained political significance since Donald Trump regained the US presidency. He regards countries which have big trade surpluses as taking advantage of the US. Last week he launched his ""fair and reciprocal"" plan for trade which could pave the way to large tariffs, or import taxes, on goods from many countries. Trump mentioned Canada, Taiwan and India as well as describing the EU as being ""absolutely brutal on trade"". So far Trump has not given any indication that he would seek to single Ireland out among EU countries. Trade policy in the EU is what is known as an ""exclusive competence"" meaning that only the EU can negotiate trade deals and impose tariffs, rather than individual states. The major reason for Ireland's trade surplus with the US is the presence of pharmaceutical manufacturers who export most of their Irish output to the US. The CSO said that in 2024 overall exports of medical and pharmaceutical products rose by 22.4bn or 29% to just under €100bn (£83.1bn). These products accounted for 45% of all Irish goods exports. One likely factor for the increase in exports in 2024 is that Eli Lily manufactures its weight loss drug, Zepbound, at a facility in County Cork. US pharma companies are in Ireland partially because of the country's low corporation tax rate. The researcher Brad Setser, who works for the US Council on Foreign Relations, has tracked the activities of the pharmaceutical companies. In 2023, in evidence to the US Congress finance committee, he said: ""There is no plausible explanation for the current scale of US imports of pharmaceuticals from Belgium, Ireland, Switzerland, and Singapore that isn't tied to tax avoidance.""",Irish goods exports to US surge by 34%,John Campbell,BBC News,2025-02-17T07:53:47,2025-02-17T07:53:47,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/brazil-oil-opec-cop30-lula-3437780649f1d02bb041bd786131062e,"BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazil’s government on Tuesday approved joining OPEC+, a group of major oil-exporting nations, signaling the country’s evolution into a major oil state just nine months ahead of hosting the United Nations’ annual climate summit. The National Council for Energy Policy’s approval came in response to an official invitation in 2023. The group includes the 12 members of OPEC, the longstanding group set up to coordinate oil production to stabilize markets, plus 10 more significant oil-producing nations with Russia by far the largest. Though non-OPEC members agree to cooperate with OPEC nations, Brazil won’t have any binding obligation such as production cuts, Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira said at a news conference. The participation will be limited to the Charter of Cooperation, a permanent forum for OPEC and OPEC+ countries to discuss industry-related issues. The South American country will not participate in decisions. Silveira called the charter merely “a forum for discussing strategies among oil-producing countries. We should not be ashamed of being oil producers. Brazil needs to grow, develop and create income and jobs.” President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva began his third term in 2023 touting himself as an environmental defender, and has worked to reduce deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and to protect Indigenous rights. But he has also argued that new oil revenues could finance a transition to green energy. In recent weeks, he has pressed the country’s environmental regulator to approve exploratory drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River, one of the most biodiverse regions of the world. Brazil is the world’s seventh-largest oil producer, with about 4.3 million barrels daily, or 4% of the world´s output, according to Energy Information Administration, a U.S. government agency. In 2024, crude oil became the country´s top export product, accounting for 13.3% of Brazil’s foreign sales, surpassing soy. The U..S. is the world’s largest producer at nearly 22 million barrels daily, with Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, at about 11 million barrels. Brazil´s move is “comprehensive and coherent,” said Luís Eduardo Duque Dutra, an oil expert and a professor in the chemistry department at the Federal University of Rio Janeiro. He noted that, along with OPEC+, the energy council also approved the country´s membership in two other bodies, the International Energy Agency and the International Renewable Energy Agency. “This helps keep track of the global situation, matching the country’s growing importance after developing pre-salt (offshore oil) reserves and its wind and solar energy potentials,” he told The Associated Press. He also said Brazil would benefit from relations with the other countries: “In times of trade wars, information is as valuable as gold.” Lula’s pursuit of increased oil production, however, has met criticism as Brazil prepares to host the UN climate summit known as COP30 in November. A central push of the annual climate talks has been to reduce the use of fossil fuels, which when burned releases greenhouse gases that heat the planet. “Brazil’s entrance to any OPEC body is another sign of the government’s setback,” says Suely Araújo, a spokesperson of the Climate Observatory, a network of 133 environmental, civil society and academic groups. Opening up new areas for fossil fuel exploration “indicates that we are choosing solutions from the past in the face of a huge challenge for the present and the future,” Araujo said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o,"Hamas says it will hand over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest people held by the Palestinian armed group. The group's negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the bodies would include those of the Bibas family - Shiri and her young children Kfir and Ariel, who were aged nine months and four years when Hamas kidnapped them during the 7 October 2023 attack. Hamas alleges that the three were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israel has not confirmed this. The children's father Yarden was released by Hamasearlier this month. Al-Hayya said Hamas would also release six living hostages on Saturday – double the number originally planned. In exchange, Israel will free all women and those under the age of 19 arrested since last October and is allowing some rubble-clearing equipment into Gaza through the border with Egypt. In a statement, al-Hayya said the group had agreed ""handing over four bodies of the occupation prisoners on Thursday 20 February, including the bodies of the Bibas family"". Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. Israeli officials have said only that they are gravely concerned for their lives. An Israeli official told Reuters that deceased hostages would undergo identification in Israel before being named. In a statement, the Bibas family said: ""In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson's announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages' remains release phase. ""We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter. ""Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over. Hamas has named two of the six Israelis to be released on Saturday. They are Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who were seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively after they crossed into Gaza on their own. The Israeli government has said both suffered from mental health issues at the time. The families of several hostages have said that their loved ones are among those due to be released on the same day. They are Omer Shem Tov, 22, Eliya Cohen, 27 and Omer Wenkert, 23, who were taken from the Nova Festival on 7 October 2023, and 40-year-old Tal Shoam who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri. Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages. In exchange, Israel agreed to release about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. Talks on progressing to the second phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun. Hamas has said it is ready to release in one go all the hostages due to be freed in phase two of the ceasefire deal with Israel.  But a Hamas spokesman made clear that the offer involving more than 60 remaining hostages was dependent on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an agreement for a permanent end to the war.  Hamas also rejected Israel's demand for its disarmament and removal from Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the talks would begin ""this week"".  He said Israel would ""not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organisation in Gaza"" but that Israel could prolong the ceasefire if discussions were productive. ""If we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement (then) we will make this time-frame work longer,"" Saar said. A total of 73 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - a mixture of Israeli soldiers and civilians both dead and alive. This also includes Thai and Nepalese nationals.  Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. Israel responded with a 15-month military offensive that killed 47,460 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and devastated the coastal enclave.",Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family,Gabriela Pomeroy,BBC News,2025-02-18T10:36:35,2025-02-19T01:29:15,gemini-2.0-flash

Authorities have so far notified 17 generals and 13 field grade officers that they are under investigation over Yoon's short-lived declaration of martial law, according to the ministry report submitted to Rep. Ahn Gyu-back of the main opposition Democratic Party (DP). Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Park An-su, who was appointed as martial law commander, is the highest-ranking service member and the only four-star general to be under investigation. The list also includes five three-star generals -- Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Jeong Jin-pal, who served as deputy martial law commander; Lt. Gen. Won Cheon-hee, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency; Lt. Gen. Yeo In-hyung, former head of the Defense Counterintelligence Command; Lt. Gen. Kwak Jong-keun, former chief of the Army Special Warfare Command; and Lt. Gen. Lee Jin-woo, former head of the Capital Defense Command.

(Yonhap) Others on the list include three two-star generals, five one-star generals, three designated for promotion to one-star generals, 11 colonels, one lieutenant colonel and one major. No junior officers, noncommissioned officers or conscripts are currently under investigation. In terms of affiliated unit, eight members of the Defense Counterintelligence Command were under investigation -- the highest among the units accused of involvement in martial law operations. The command is accused of mobilizing troops to apprehend politicians and planning to confiscate the servers of the National Election Commission during martial law. Among the 30 service members under investigation, Gen. Park, Lt. Gen. Yeo, Lt. Gen. Lee, Lt. Gen. Kwak and Maj. Gen.

https://apnews.com/article/panama-trump-migrants-darien-d841c33a215c172b8f99d0aeb43b0455,"PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama is detaining in a hotel nearly 300 people from various countries deported under U.S. President Donald Trump, not allowing them to leave while waiting for international authorities to organize a return to their countries. More than 40% of the migrants, authorities say, won’t voluntarily return to their homeland. Migrants in the hotel rooms held messages to the windows reading “Help” and “We are not save (sic) in our country.” The migrants hailed from 10 mostly Asian countries, including Iran, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China and others. The U.S. has difficulty deporting directly to some of those countries so Panama is being used as a stopover. Costa Rica was expected to receive a similar flight of third-country deportees on Wednesday. Panama’s Security Minister Frank Abrego said Tuesday the migrants are receiving medical attention and food as part of a migration agreement between Panama and the U.S. The Panamanian government has now agreed to serve as a “bridge” or transit country for deportees, while the U.S. bears all the costs of the operation. The agreement was announced earlier this month after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino, who faces political pressure over Trump’s threats of retaking control of the Panama Canal, announced the arrival of the first of the deportation flights last Thursday. The confinement and legal limbo the deportees face has raised alarm in the Central American country, especially as images spread of migrants peaking through the windows of their rooms on high floors of the hotel and displaying the notes pleading for help. Abrego denied the foreigners are being detained even though they cannot leave the rooms of their hotel, which is being guarded by police. Abrego said that 171 of the 299 deportees have agreed to return voluntarily to their respective countries with help from the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. Refugee Agency. U.N. agencies are talking with the other 128 migrants in an effort to find a destination for them in third countries. Abrego said that one deported Irish citizen has already returned to her country. Those who do not agree to return to their countries will be temporarily held in a facility in the remote Darien province through which hundreds of thousands of migrants have crossed on their journey north in recent years, Abrego said. The Panamanian Ombudsman’s Office was scheduled to provide more details on the deportees’ situation later Tuesday.",Nearly 300 deportees from US held in Panama hotel as officials try to return them to their countries,Juan Zamorano,AP News,2025-02-18T00:30:16,2025-02-18T23:31:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/congo-un-children-killed-bukavu-rebels-0b72da70e3e96b1c100812443fc3201a,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Rwanda-backed rebels appeared to be heading toward a third major city in eastern Congo, residents said Tuesday, as international pressure rose over the M23’s expansion in a mineral-rich region that’s critical for global technology. The M23 rebels on Tuesday attacked all the main Congolese army positions on the road to Butembo, a city of 150,000 people, and the situation was rapidly deteriorating, said Auguste Kombi, a civil society leader in Kitsombiro, a town along the road. “We’re afraid that the enemy will advance to Butembo,” Kombi said. Butembo is about 210 kilometers (130 miles) north of Goma, the city of over 2 million people that the M23 rebels seized last month as about 3,000 people were killed. The advance on Butembo means the rebels are spanning out both north and south of Goma. The rebels this week seized another provincial capital to Goma’s south, Bukavu, near Burundi. The region is rich in gold and coltan, a key mineral for the production of capacitors used in most consumer electronics such as laptops and smartphones. Also Tuesday, the M23 captured the town of Kamanyola, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of Bukavu, after they overcame resistance from the Congolese army in the evening, said Steve Mubalama, a civil society representative in the town. Mubalama expressed fears that the M23 rebels would advance a further 75 kilometers (45 miles) to the south to take the strategic city of Uvira. The M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo’s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, over 1,000 miles away. “We’re worried because we’re in danger of experiencing a situation similar to that in Goma, with the loss of human lives,” said Kambale Nyuliro, a Kitsombiro civil servant. He told the AP that Lubero town, on the way to Butembo, was surrounded on three sides by M23 fighters but still under Congolese army control. “Since the fighting began, the enemy has only advanced,” he said. Analysts have said the rebels are eyeing political power, unlike their brief capture of Goma, a major security and humanitarian hub, in 2012. The rebel-appointed mayor of Goma said Tuesday they would carry out a census, in a sign of their intention to maintain control of the city. And ferry service resumed between Goma and Bukavu, the only way to travel between them for now. Rwanda has accused Congo of enlisting ethnic Hutu fighters responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus. M23 says it’s fighting to protect Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination and wants to transform Congo from a failed state to a modern one. Analysts have called those pretexts for Rwanda’s involvement. On Tuesday, the U.K. Foreign Office summoned the Rwandan ambassador in London and in a statement condemned the rebel gains, calling them “an unacceptable violation of (Congo’s) sovereignty and territorial integrity.” “The government of Rwanda must immediately withdraw all Rwanda Defense Force troops from Congolese territory,” the statement added. There was no immediate comment from Rwanda. Dozens of armed groups have long been active in eastern Congo, displacing more than 6 million people and creating the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. The M23’s latest movement north keeps the rebels not far from Uganda, which on Tuesday said it sent troops into yet another eastern Congo city further to the north, Bunia. Uganda said it was meant to combat violence by armed groups. It has periodically sent troops into Congo in agreement with the government in Kinshasa. Also Tuesday, the U.N. human rights chief accused the Rwanda-backed rebels of killing children and attacking hospitals and warehouses storing humanitarian aid. Volker Türk said in a statement that his office “confirmed cases of summary execution of children by M23 after they entered the city of Bukavu last week. We are also aware that children were in possession of weapons.” He provided no details, but U.N. agencies have previously accused both the rebels and Congolese government forces of recruiting children. The U.N. Human Rights Council this month launched a commission that will investigate atrocities, including rapes and killings akin to “summary executions,” committed by both sides this year.",Residents say Rwanda-backed rebels are advancing on a third city in eastern Congo,Wilson Mcmakin,AP News,2025-02-18T06:55:48,2025-02-18T13:05:30,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/honduras-extradition-treaty-castro-trump-037fe1b75d6d32f47b67a3277abb2797,"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — Honduran President Xiomara Castro on Tuesday reversed course on a decision to end a long-running extradition treaty with the United States after reaching an agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. The reversal came as the Trump administration has struck agreements with a number of Central American nations to receive deported migrants from other nations, often after pressure was applied or offers of support made on other issues. “I announce that I have reached an agreement with the new American administration so that the extradition treaty will continue with the necessary safeguards for the state of Honduras,” Castro wrote in a post on X. Honduras was not a stop on U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s recent Central American tour and while Honduras has continued to receive its own deportees, neither Honduras nor the U.S. have said there is a deal for Honduras to also receive migrants from other nations. In February, Mexico started sending 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to postpone threatened 25% tariffs. Last month, Colombia’s firebrand leftist leader caved in a showdown after Trump threatened steep tariffs and sanctions after the Colombian government said it wouldn’t take deportation flights in U.S. military aircraft. On Tuesday, Honduran Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina said the extradition treaty was part of direct talks with the White House, in which the governments discussed five key issues: migration, military agreements, free trade agreements, investment in trade infrastructure in Honduras and extradition. It wasn’t immediately clear what, if anything, Honduras would get from the agreement. Reina added that the extradition treaty would include “important, normal safeguards,” namely that cases of extradition would not be politicized in any way and based on legal factors. It’s a change of tone from Castro’s administration. In August, Castro said that she would end the treaty after the U.S. ambassador in Honduras questioned a visit of Honduran military officials to Venezuela to meet with officials accused by the State Department of drug trafficking. The comments by the diplomat stroked anger in the Honduran government, which decided to end the treaty. The treaty has seen high-profile crime suspects including Castro’s predecessor former President Juan Orlando Hernández extradited to the U.S. He’s serving a 45-year prison sentence in the U.S. for drug trafficking. Days after Castro announced she was canceling the treaty, her brother-in-law Carlos Zelaya, brother of former President Manuel Zelaya, appeared in a video in which he is seen with several well-known drug traffickers negotiating a bribe. The video fueled anger in many Hondurans, who said that her real reason to end the treaty was to protect her family. Reina said Tuesday the latest decision was important to ensure the democratic integrity of the country’s upcoming elections, a process in which the Honduran military is a guarantor. “We are not here to favor politicians or criminals, but, if in any way, the extradition treaty is used to destabilize the government or elections through an attack on the armed forces, that does concern us,” he said.",Honduran president changes course on vow to end extradition treaty with US,Marlon González,AP News,2025-02-18T22:03:16,2025-02-18T18:03:16,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0n5e1pdz9o,"Donald Trump has taken aim at Ukraine after its President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said it was a ""surprise"" his country had not been invited to talks in Saudi Arabia on ending the war with Russia. Saying he was ""disappointed"" by Ukraine's reaction, he appeared to blame Ukraine for starting the war, saying the country ""could have made a deal"" earlier. A full-scale Russian invasion sparked the war in Ukraine almost three years ago. Earlier on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Riyadh for the first high-level, face-to-face talks between the two countries since the invasion, and agreed to appoint teams to start negotiating the end of the war. Lavrov said his country would not accept peacekeeping forces from Nato countries in Ukraine under any peace deal, a proposal raised at a meeting of European members of Nato in Paris on Monday. European Nato states, who remain committed to supporting Ukraine against Russia, have been smarting at being sidelined by Trump's unilateral peace initiative, which reversed the resolutely pro-Ukraine policy of his predecessor as president, Joe Biden. Following what he referred to as ""the infamous meeting"" - to which Ukraine was not invited either - Zelensky accused the Russian delegation in Riyadh of lying, adding that Russia could not be trusted and ""must be pressured for peace"". Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump was asked by BBC News what his message was to Ukrainians who might feel betrayed. ""I hear that they're upset about not having a seat, well, they've had a seat for three years and a long time before that. This could have been settled very easily,"" he said. ""You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,"" he later added. ""I could have made a deal for Ukraine,"" he said. ""That would have given them almost all of the land, everything, almost all of the land - and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished."" After the meeting in Riyadh, Trump said he was ""much more confident"". ""They were very good,"" he said. ""Russia wants to do something. They want to stop the savage barbarianism."" ""I think I have the power to end this war,"" he added. Trump also criticised the length of time since an election was held in Ukraine, when asked if the US would support Russian demands for one to be held. ""They want a seat at the table, but... wouldn't the people of Ukraine have a say? It's been a long time since we've had an election,"" the president responded. He also claimed Zelensky - who won a five-year term in 2019 - was ""down at 4% approval rating"". Zelensky has remained in office while the country has been under martial law following the onset of the conflict. One opinion poll in December suggested52% of Ukrainians surveyed said they ""trust"" Zelensky. Meanwhile, when asked about the prospect of European countries sending troops to Ukraine, Trump said: ""If they want to do that, that's great, I'm all for it."" However, he added of a potential US deployment of troops: ""We won't have to put any over there because, you know, we're very far away."" After Monday's meeting in Paris, British Prime Minister Sir KeirStarmer said any Ukraine peace deal would require a ""US backstop"" to deter Russiafrom attacking its neighbour again. Sir Keir said a ""US security guarantee was the only way to effectively deter Russia"", and vowed to discuss the ""key elements"" of a peace deal with Trump in Washington next week. Also at the talks in Riyadh were US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, as well as Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev. Stressing that Moscow would not agree to peacekeeping forces from Nato countries in Ukraine under any peace deal, Lavrov said: ""Any appearance by armed forces under some other flag does not change anything. It is of course completely unacceptable."" He said the US and Russia would appoint ambassadors to each other's countries as soon as possible and create conditions to ""restore co-operation in full"". ""It was a very useful conversation. We listened to each other, and we heard each other,"" he said. He reiterated Russia's previous position that any expansion of the Nato defence alliance - and Ukraine joining it - would be a ""direct threat"" to Russia. Rubio for his part said he was ""convinced"" Russia was ""willing to begin to engage in a serious process"" to end the conflict. ""There has to be concessions made by all sides. We're not going to predetermine what those are."" ""Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one"", he added. Rubio said the European Union was going to ""have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed"". On the absence of Ukraine at the meeting, he insisted ""no-one is being sidelined"". ""Everyone involved in that conflict has to be OK with it, it has to be acceptable to them,"" he added. The talks in Paris, which were hastily arranged in response to the apparent rapprochement between Russia and the US under Trump, did not agree a unified position. Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz said discussing sending troops to Ukraine at present was ""completely premature"". Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said he did not intend to send troops while Italy's Giorgia Meloni - the only European leader to attend Trump's inauguration - expressed doubts. She told the meeting in Paris that deploying European troops would be ""the most complex and the least effective"" way of securing peace in Ukraine. Ukraine's leader looked visibly tired and upset when he gave his reaction to the Riyadh meeting during a news conference in Turkey. ""We want everything to be fair and so that nobody decides anything behind our back,"" Zelensky said. ""You cannot make decisions without Ukraine on how to end the war in Ukraine."" He will be alarmed by all the smiles on both American and Russian faces in Riyadh, but he will know that he can do little to change whatever they agree on over his head. The Ukrainian president will also know that his country's chances of resisting - let alone defeating - Russian troops without American help are very slim. Following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine. The conflict burst into all-out war when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Moscow's attempts to take control of the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have taken around one-fifth of Ukraine's territory in the east and south, and have carried out air strikes across the country. Ukraine has retaliated with artillery and drone strikes, as well as a ground offensive against Russia's western Kursk region. Accurate casualty counts are hard to come by but it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured, and millions of Ukrainian civilians have fled as refugees. Additional reporting by George Wright, Gabriela Pomeroy and Vitaliy Shevchenko Waltz had faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed.

https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-us-saudi-arctic-energy-rdif-ukraine-russia-capital/,"Russia and the United States discussed possible cooperation on energy projects in the Arctic at a meeting in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, a top Russian negotiator told POLITICO. Kirill Dmitriev, who heads the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said the economic conversations had been about broad strokes, but that the two sides had discussed some “specific areas of cooperation.” “It was more a general discussion — maybe joint projects in the Arctic. We specifically discussed the Arctic,” Dmitriev said by phone as he boarded a flight home after the talks in Riyadh. The negotiations, which sidelined Ukraine and Europe, have sparked angst and urgency in key European capitals as U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin look set to decide on Ukraine’s future without substantial input from Kyiv or its Western allies. For his part, Trump aims to expand American influence in the Arctic, having repeatedly mused about acquiring Greenland from Denmark — and has refused to rule out using military force or economic coercion to seize control of the massive island with its vast mineral wealth and key strategic location. U.S. oil major ExxonMobil had partnered with Russian state oil major Rosneft to explore for hydrocarbons in the high Arctic, but pulled out in 2018 following the imposition of Western sanctions in response to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Dmitriev was part of a Russian delegation that included Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov and was in Saudi Arabia for initial discissions on Ukraine. Tuesday’s talks were the first contact between officials from the two sides following a call between Trump and Putin last week. He commented on the economic track of the talks, which he described as good, but declined to go into detail on the political discussions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S. delegation, accompanied by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. “Positive after the Biden administration destroyed all of the communication, destroyed all of the discussion,” he said. In further remarks, Dmitriev said he had presented an estimate by the RDIF that U.S. businesses had lost around $300 billion as a result of leaving Russia following Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. “There is an understanding that bad relations between Russia and the U.S. actually cost a lot to American business, and there are ways to have productive cooperation benefit both Russia and the U.S.” he said. “I would not want to have unrealistic expectations for the process going forward, but I think joint investments between Russia and the U.S. are now more likely after this meeting than before,” he added. On next steps, Dmitriev said the two sides had agreed to set up working groups and have regular high-level contacts. No further meetings have yet been scheduled. The RDIF was set up in 2011 to partner with foreign investors on projects in Russia, and later backed a Covid-19 vaccine. The sovereign fund was sidelined following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as foreign investors pulled out or scaled back their exposure to Russia. Shortly before Putin ordered in Russian troops, the RDIF issued a statement calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.",Russia and US eye joint Arctic energy projects after Saudi talks,Douglas Busvine,POLITICO,2025-02-18T13:20:11,2025-02-18T13:39:32,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250218001052315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, Feb. 18 (Yonhap) -- The Constitutional Court decided Tuesday to proceed with its 10th hearing of President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment trial as planned, increasing the likelihood that a ruling could be reached by the end of next month. Yoon had initially requested a postponement of Thursday's 2 p.m. hearing, citing a scheduling conflict with the first preliminary hearing of his criminal trial on insurrection charges. Moon Hyung-bae, the acting court president, rejected the request, noting that the criminal trial hearing was set for 10 a.m. the same day, leaving enough time for both proceedings. Moon also cited other factors, including the need to coordinate the schedules of all parties involved, such as Yoon and the National Assembly's legal teams, the justices, and the witnesses. However, near the end of Tuesday's hearing, the court agreed to push the impeachment hearing to 3 p.m., following a renewed request from Yoon's lawyer Yun Gap-geun, who argued that ""unforeseeable circumstances"" during the criminal trial could cause delays. With the rescheduling, the 10th hearing is expected to conclude around 9 p.m. at the earliest. The court's decision to adhere to its hearing schedule, despite time constraints, suggests the proceedings could conclude soon, potentially paving the way for a verdict by late March on whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. At Tuesday's hearing, the legal representatives of Yoon and the National Assembly summarized their arguments to date. The court also reviewed previously admitted but unexamined evidence. No witnesses testified. The hearing will leave only one additional hearing Thursday before proceedings wrap up, and each side is asked to present their final statements. Impeached Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and Hong Jang-won, former first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service, have been called to testify as witnesses Thursday. Meanwhile, Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the National Police Agency, declined to testify for the third time. The court previously asked prosecutors to forcibly bring in Cho, who refused two previous requests over health issues. Yoon arrived at the court in a convoy but left shortly before the hearing began to return to the Seoul Detention Center, where he has been held since mid-January. His legal team said he met with his lawyers and determined his attendance was not necessary, as they would only be presenting a summary of their arguments so far. The president has been standing trial at the Constitutional Court on the validity of his impeachment by the National Assembly over his short-lived Dec. 3 imposition of martial law, while also facing criminal charges of inciting an insurrection through the decree. hague@yna.co.kr(END)",(2nd LD) Constitutional Court moves forward with Yoon's impeachment trial despite tight schedule,Woo Jae-yeon,Yonhap News Agency,2025-02-18T21:54:12,2025-02-18T21:54:12,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-842691,"Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer will lead the Israeli delegation's negotiations over the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, The Jerusalem Post independently verified on Tuesday evening. Ron Dermer is known for his deep personal and political alignment with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior members of US President Donald Trump's administration, particularly given Dermer served as Israel's Ambassador to Washington during Trump's first term. Dermer was also notably a key part in finalizing the negotiations of the Abraham Accords in 2020. Dermer takes the lead over from Mossad Director David Barnea, who led the negotiations for phase one of the deal. As Herb Keinon wrote in The Jerusalem Post on February 4, ""Dermerâ	ms appointment is clearly no minor bureaucratic reshuffle. Instead, it would inject a stronger political and diplomatic dimension into the talks â	 at least from the Israeli side â	 and reinforce the prime ministerâ	ms direct control over the process."" The timing comes amid the shift from the end of phase one of the negotiations, which largely involved the schedule to release Israeli hostages held by Hamas terrorists, and the beginning of phase two of the negotiations, which largely involves planning for a post-war Gaza. Phase two also will involve more direct talks between Israel and US officials, while phase one was more between Israel and Qatari officials. The timing of this announcement may be in part due to Netanyahu seeking to place Dermer in control during the ongoing negotiations, as he is closer aligned to Netanyahu's goals than either Barnea, or Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) chief Ronen Bar.

The action plan, which was jointly issued by eight government departments, includes measures to step up the development of a slew of next-generation battery technologies and create a small group of leading companies in the field. The hope is that new energy storage solutions can help China increase efficiency in its renewables sector, allowing it to transition away from fossil fuels without making the power grid vulnerable to outages. “It is about energy sovereignty – not only ensuring sufficient energy supplies in anticipation of rising demand due to AI, but also maintaining the autonomy to decide the energy mix, energy partners and energy policies China adopts,” said Liang Yan, a professor of economics at Willamette University in the United States. The policy would also help China meet its “double carbon goals” – namely, reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, Liang added.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-developing-plan-to-rebuild-gaza-as-counter-to-trumps-call-to-depopulate-area/,"CAIRO — Egypt is developing a plan to rebuild Gaza without forcing Palestinians out of the Strip, in a counter to US President Donald Trump’s proposal to depopulate the territory and for Washington to take it over. Egypt’s state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said the proposal calls for establishing “secure areas” within Gaza where Palestinians can live initially while Egyptian and international construction firms remove and rehabilitate the Strip’s infrastructure. Egyptian officials have been discussing the plan with European diplomats as well as with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, according to two Egyptian officials and Arab and Western diplomats. They are also discussing ways to fund the reconstruction, including an international conference on Gaza reconstruction, said one of the Egyptian officials and an Arab diplomat. The officials and diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the proposal is still being negotiated. The plan comes after an international uproar over Trump’s call for the removal of Gaza’s population of some 2 million Palestinians. Trump suggested the United States would take over the Gaza Strip and rebuild it into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” though Palestinians would not be allowed back. Palestinians have widely said they will not leave their homeland, while Egypt, and Jordan, backed by Saudi Arabia, have refused Trump’s calls for them to take in Gaza’s population. Rights groups have widely said the plan amounts to forced expulsion, a potential war crime. European countries have also largely denounced Trump’s plan. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the idea and says Israel is preparing to implement it. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Saudi Arabia on Monday in a tour of the region, has said the United States was up for hearing alternative proposals. “If the Arab countries have a better plan, then that’s great,” Rubio said Thursday on the US radio program “Clay and Buck Show.” Egypt’s Al-Ahram said the proposal is designed to “refute American President Trump’s logic” and counter “any other visions or plans that aim to change the geographic and demographic structure of the Gaza Strip.” Gaza is nearing a critical juncture, with the first phase of a ceasefire with Israel due to run out in early March. Israel and Hamas must still negotiate a second phase meant to bring a release of all remaining hostages held by the terrorists, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a long-term halt to the war. The three-stage ceasefire agreement, reached last month, halted some 15 months of fighting triggered by the group’s October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel, when Hamas-led terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. The deal requires Hamas to release all its hostages, Israel to release thousands of Palestinian security prisoners — including hundreds serving life sentences — and a halt to fighting in the Strip, followed by negotiations for a “sustainable calm” and IDF withdrawal from the enclave. Any reconstruction plan will be impossible to implement without a deal on the second phase, including an agreement on who will govern Gaza in the long term. Israel demands the elimination of Hamas as a political or military force in the territory, and international donors are unlikely to contribute to any rebuilding if Hamas is in charge. Central to Egypt’s proposal is the establishment of a Palestinian administration that is not aligned with either Hamas or the Palestinian Authority to run the Strip and oversee the reconstruction efforts, according to the two Egyptian officials involved in the efforts. It also calls for a Palestinian police force mainly made up of former Palestinian Authority policemen who remained in Gaza after Hamas took over the enclave in 2007, with reinforcement from Egyptian- and Western-trained forces. Asked about the possibility of deploying an outside Arab force in Gaza, one Egyptian official and the Arab diplomat said Arab countries would only agree if there were a “clear path” for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Netanyahu has rejected any Palestinian state as well as any role for Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza, though he has not put forward any clear alternative. Hamas has indicated it is willing to give up power in Gaza. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou told The Associated Press on Sunday that the group has accepted either a Palestinian unity government without Hamas’s participation or a committee of technocrats to run the territory. The Palestinian Authority, which governs pockets of the West Bank, has so far opposed any plans for Gaza that exclude it. The Western diplomat said France and Germany have backed the idea of Arab countries developing a counterproposal to Trump’s plan, and that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi discussed his government’s efforts with the French president in a phone call earlier this month. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty also briefed the German foreign minister and other EU officials on the sidelines of last week’s Munich security conference, one of the Egyptian officials said. Officials from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan will discuss Egypt’s proposal at a gathering in Riyadh this week, before introducing it to the Arab summit later this month, according to the two Egyptian officials and the Arab diplomat. The 16 months of war in Gaza devastated the territory. Around a quarter million housing units have been destroyed or damaged, according to UN estimates. More than 90 percent of the roads and more than 80% of health facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Damage to infrastructure has been estimated at some $30 billion, along with an estimated $16 billion in damage to housing. Egypt’s plan calls for a three-phase reconstruction process that will take up to five years, without removing Palestinians from Gaza, the Egyptian officials said. It designates three “safe zones” within Gaza to relocate Palestinians during an initial six-month “early recovery period.” The zones will be equipped with mobile houses and shelters, with humanitarian aid streaming in. More than two dozen Egyptian and international firms would take part in removing the rubble and rebuilding the strip’s infrastructure. The reconstruction would provide tens of thousands of jobs to Gaza’s population, the officials said. The plan is largely the same as that which Arab countries have been working on for the past year, but Israel has long rejected the idea of giving any role to the PA, leaving many of those proposals dead on arrival. Most critical will be Egypt’s effort to convince Trump to get behind the plan, because if Washington does, it will be easier to get Israel on board as well. Al Arabiya reported that the Egyptian plan will also include a clause requiring various stakeholders to serve as guarantors that Israel will not resume fighting in Gaza for at least 10 years. Jerusalem is likely to resist any limits to its ability to use military force against future threats from Gaza.",Egypt developing plan to rebuild Gaza as counter to Trump’s call to depopulate area,"AP, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-02-18T07:08:49,2025-02-18T07:58:12,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/pope-francis-legacy-death-complex-italy-rome-health/,"ROME — Pope Francis is seriously worried about his health after being hospitalized with severe bronchitis, and is rushing to tie up loose ends ahead of the battle to succeed him. The pope was admitted to a special ward earlier this month in Gemelli Hospital in Rome with a respiratory infection, and he has since been forced to cancel a number of public appearances. It’s the latest health crisis for the 88-year-old pontiff, who had part of a lung removed as a young man and has become increasingly fragile in recent years. The Holy See press office has trickled out continuous updates, and on Monday said the pope’s bronchitis had advanced to a “polymicrobial infection” with a “complex clinical picture.” According to two people familiar with the matter, Francis has been suffering from intense pain and has privately expressed certainty he won’t make it this time. On Sunday, doctors at Gemelli distressed the pope by barring him from delivering his regular morning Angelus sermon, which he has rarely missed, even when hospitalized, said one of the people and a third person. He is now acting entirely on “doctors’ orders,” said one of them.  The pope initially resisted going to hospital but was told in no uncertain terms that he was at risk of dying if he stayed in his room in the Vatican, the second person added. As his health has deteriorated over the last month, Francis has also moved to complete key initiatives and appoint sympathetic figures to key posts, following a progressive-tinted papacy marked by bitter ideological divisions.  Since he became pope in 2013, Francis has aimed to make the Church more inclusive, opening up key roles to women and LGBT+ people. While that has provoked furious reaction from many conservatives, liberals complain that the reforms have been insufficient. Meanwhile, the pope’s efforts to put an end to rampant child abuse by clerics have produced mixed results. Papal succession will be political On Feb. 6, before he was hospitalized, he extended the term of the Italian cardinal Giovanni Battista Re as dean of the College of Cardinals, a role that will oversee some preparations for a potential conclave, the secretive gathering that determines the selection of a new pope. The move, which controversially sidestepped a scheduled vote on the next dean by top cardinals, was intended to ensure that the process plays out according to Francis’s wishes, the people said.  Re, a longtime Vatican operator, is too old to participate in the conclave himself. Nevertheless, he will be a pivotal figure in the behind-closed-doors discussions that often take place before the conclave. That Francis selected him as dean instead of a younger candidate suggests he wanted to keep a friendly face in the role who would defend his legacy, said one of the people. “The run-up to the conclave is more important as that’s where lobbying goes on,” the person said. Ahead of the 2013 conclave that elected him pope, Francis himself reportedly benefitted from the influence of a group of cardinals who were too old to participate in the proceedings but nevertheless held sway over the outcome. Re’s continuation in the role will also see him deliver funeral rites for Francis should he die. The pope has privately joked that Re will be “kinder” to him than other candidates, a second person added. The Holy See’s press office declined to comment. Before his health took a turn for the worse, Francis was navigating a politically sensitive moment. Earlier this month, he issued an extraordinary rebuke of United States Vice President JD Vance’s characterization of Ordo Amoris, a theological concept relating to love that Vance used to justify President Donald Trump’s migrant policy. The papal pushback triggered fury from the White House, raising the prospect of a highly politicized succession battle should Francis die. “They’ve already influenced European politics, they’d have no problem influencing the conclave,” said one close observer of Vatican politics, referring to the Trump administration. “They might be looking for someone less confrontational.” On Saturday, the pontiff also sped up his unprecedented reformist move to appoint a nun, Sister Raffaella Petrini, as the next and first woman governor of Vatican City, announcing that Petrini’s term would begin on March 1. That date was earlier than some expected and triggered unease about his health among allies, according to one high-ranking Church official. However, it might also have been a coincidence: the current governor, Cardinal Fernando Vérgez Alzaga, will turn 80 that day, making him ineligible for the role. Even if Francis survives his latest illness, observers see this as a likely turning point as Francis shifts focus from making headway on reform to locking it in. “He may not die now but of course he eventually will,” said one Vatican official. “We all die — and he’s an 88-year-old man with lung problems.”","Pope Francis, sensing he is close to death, moves to protect his legacy",Ben Munster,POLITICO,2025-02-17T21:56:13,2025-02-18T08:49:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgrgz8271go,"Meta has announced plans to build a 50,000km (31,000 mile) sub-sea cable across the world. The tech giant said Project Waterworth - connecting the US, India, South Africa, Brazil and other regions - will be the world's longest underwater cable project when completed. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has sought to extend its presence in technology beyond social media, including in artificial intelligence (AI) and the infrastructure that supports it. It said its new cable project would provide ""industry-leading connectivity"" to five major continents and help support its AI projects. ""This project will enable greater economic co-operation, facilitate digital inclusion, and open opportunities for technological development in these regions,"" Meta said in a blog post. The cable would be the longest to date that uses a 24 fibre-pair system, giving it a higher capacity, according to the firm. Sub-sea cables have become increasingly important as they provide the means to power a variety of digital services and transfer data worldwide at speed. One regularly-cited statistic suggests more than 95% of the world's internet traffic  is transferred through undersea cables. Telecommunications market research firm TeleGeography says there are currently more than 600 publicly-known sub-sea cable systems worldwide. This includes the 2Africa cable, backed by Meta and mobile network operators such as Orange, Vodafone and China Mobile, which links three continents and spans 45,000km. Tech firms that serve as major providers of web services have invested huge sums in cable infrastructure. Google said in 2024 it would build the first sub-sea cable connecting Africa and Australia, and announced a $1bn investment to boost connectivity to Japan with two new sub-sea cables in the Pacific Ocean. ""Over the past decade there has been a shift in which these cables are increasingly laid by large technology companies,"" Professor Vili Lehdonvirta of the Oxford Internet Institute told the BBC.  He said this is in contrast to the past, where underwater cables were laid and financed by large groups of national telecoms firms, due to their considerable investment needs. Prof Lehdonvirta said this reflects the growing size and position of big tech firms to be able to fund such infrastructure independently - something that ""may be significant to policy makers concerned with concentration in digital markets"". Telecoms and technology industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said it spoke to Meta's ambitions.  ""Meta has shown a strong desire to own more of the connectivity slice,"" he told the BBC. ""This is a further demonstration as it seeks to leapfrog rivals in providing users with an unique experience by tightly integrating hardware, software, platform and its growing aspirations in connectivity,"" he added. The rising importance of sub-sea cables has increased concerns over their vulnerability to attacks or accidents. Following a spate of severed cables, experts have said undersea communications infrastructure is a growing arena for geopolitical tensions and conflict. Nato launched a mission in January to increase surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea after damage to critical undersea cables last year. A UK parliamentary committee recently issued a call for evidence about the UK's resilience in the face of potential disruption. This said pointed to growing concern over ""Russian and Chinese capabilities to hold undersea infrastructure at risk - particularly during periods of heightened tension or conflict"". Meta said in its blog post announcing Project Waterworth it would lay its cable system up to 7,000 meters deep and ""use enhanced burial techniques in high-risk fault areas, such as shallow waters near the coast, to avoid damage from ship anchors and other hazards"". Prof Lehdonvirta said the project appeared to diverge from more established routes, such as by skipping Europe and China and avoiding ""geopolitical hotspots"" in the Suez canal and South China sea.  And he said connecting the US with major, contested markets in the Southern hemisphere could be viewed as ""bolstering US economic and infrastructural power abroad"".",Meta plans globe-spanning sub-sea internet cable,Liv McMahon,BBC News,2025-02-17T09:47:23,2025-02-17T12:40:03,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzy300vlzo,"The US State Department has dropped a statement from its website which stated that Washington does not support Taiwan's independence - a move which has sparked anger in China. China said the revision ""sends a wrong... signal to separatist forces advocating for Taiwan independence"", and asked the US to ""correct its mistakes"". The department's fact sheet on Taiwan-US relations earlier included the phrase ""we do not support Taiwan independence"" - this was removed last week as part of what it said was a ""routine"" update. A US spokesperson was quoted as saying that it remains committed to the ""One China"" policy, it said, where US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than Taiwan. China sees self-governed Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation, although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it. As well as dropping the phrase, the factsheet, which was updated last Thursday, also says the US will support Taiwan's membership in international organisations ""where applicable"". Commenting on the changes, a spokesperson at the American Institute in Taiwan - the US' de facto embassy on the island - told local media that the fact sheet had been ""updated to inform the general public about [the US'] unofficial relationship with Taiwan"". ""We have long stated that we oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side."" On Sunday, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung thanked the US for what he called ""positive, Taiwan-friendly wordings"". But in their regular press conference on Monday, Beijing's foreign ministry slammed the move, calling the revision a ""serious regression"" in the US' stance on Taiwan. ""This sends a wrong and serious signal to separatist forces advocating for Taiwan independence and is another example of the U.S. stubbornly persisting with its wrong policy of using Taiwan to contain China,"" said Chinese spokesperson Guo Jiakun.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4z4w3v5y8o,"Sir Keir Starmer has said any Ukraine peace deal would require a ""US backstop"" to deter Russia from attacking its neighbour again. Speaking after a hastily convened meeting with European leaders in Paris, he said a ""US security guarantee was the only way to effectively deter Russia"", and vowed to discuss the ""key elements"" of a peace deal with US President Donald Trump in Washington next week. The prime minister repeated that he would consider deploying UK troops to Ukraine in the event of a lasting peace agreement. But Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a key Nato ally, said for his part, discussing sending troops to Ukraine at present was ""completely premature"". Sir Keir said Europe would ""have to do more"" to defend the continent in the face of the ""generational"" security challenge Russia posed. He avoided explaining exactly what he meant by a ""backstop"" - but his allies suggest this could involve air support, logistics and intelligence capabilities. The talks at the Élysée Palace were held to discuss concerns over the Trump administration's decision to initiate peace talks with Russia - due to start in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday - alone. Sir Keir was joined by the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, the presidents of the European Council and European Commission, and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Kyiv did not know about talks in Saudi Arabia and would not recognise any agreement made without its involvement. US officials have suggested European nations would be consulted on peace talks with Russia, but not directly involved in them. French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X in the early hours of Tuesday that he had ""just spoken"" with Trump and Zelensky. ""We will work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians. This is the key,"" he said, adding that he ""will continue these discussions in the coming days"". Prior to the meeting, the European leaders had also expressed concern after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was ""unrealistic"" to expect Ukraine would return to its borders before 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. Hegseth downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato - something Sir Keir had said it was on an ""irreversible"" path towards - and said Europe wouldhave to be primarily responsible for guaranteeing its own security going forward. Sir Keir said the US was ""not going to leave Nato"" but that it was ""time to take responsibility for our security, our continent"". Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said transatlantic relations were in a ""new stage"", and that the meeting had confirmed the time had come for ""a much greater ability for Europe to defend itself"". Sir Keir has indicated any troop contributions from the UK would be part of a multinational force to police the border between Ukrainian-held and Russian-held territory. But experts say to do so effectively would be a massive undertaking that would require a large increase in defence spending. Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, said that, unlike UN peacekeeping forces there to observe, if the force being proposed was intended to deter Russian attacks, it would be a ""whole different matter altogether"". ""You need credible, well-armed forces - and you not only need frontline forces, you need back-up forces, and air forces, and so on,"" he told the BBC. ""That's a much bigger ask."" General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, a former Nato commander, said: ""This cannot be a token force, it cannot be something that observes bad behaviour and stands on the sideline."" The former head of the British Army, Lord Dannatt, previously estimated such a force would need around 100,000 troops - with the UK contributing about two-fifths. ""We just haven't got that number available,"" he said on Saturday, adding that getting the military into shape to perform this role would come at a considerable cost. The UK currently spends around 2.3% of its total economic output on defence. The government has committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5%, but has not said when this will be achieved. Sir Keir earlier told reporters that the government would set out a path to meeting the 2.5% commitment once it finishes its strategic defence review. ""Part of my message to our European allies is that we've all got to step up on both capability and on spending and funding,"" he said. ""That includes the UK, which is why I've made that commitment to spend more."" Some European figures have signalled their agreement with this. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Europe had to ""step up"" defence spending and support for Ukraine, as ""Russia is threatening all of Europe now, unfortunately"", while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a ""surge"" in defence spending. No 10 confirmed Sir Keir's trip to Washington earlier on Monday, aftera minister said the UK could serve as a ""bridge"" between the US and Europe. The BBC understands the PM offered to host a follow-up meeting of European leaders following the Washington trip. Poland's Tusk has already indicated his nation would not send troops into Ukraine, but would continue to support it with military, financial and humanitarian aid. UK government sources argue it is ""no surprise"" there was a difference of opinion between leaders, and that not every nation is willing to show their hand quite yet. British diplomats do not believe every nation would need to commit to contributing troops - but some would. And whatever Europe's eventual role, US involvement would still be required. Prof Chalmers said: ""Having significant numbers of Nato troops on Ukrainian soil after a ceasefire would be a failure for Russia, so it's hard for me at this point to see Russia accepting such a presence as a part of the deal."" Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called on Sir Keir to recall Parliament to discuss plans to defend Ukraine. Parliament is currently in recess and is due to reconvene on 24 February. Sir Keir's spokesperson said Parliament would be consulted ""as appropriate"" but this was ""getting ahead of discussions"" with other world leaders. Fighting on the ground in Ukraine continued over the weekend, with at least three civilians killed in Russian strikes on Sunday, according to local authorities. Several areas of Ukraine are under an emergency blackout following attacks on energy infrastructure, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted and destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones on Sunday night.

https://apnews.com/article/china-xi-private-business-economy-jack-ma-7898eb671dc6f7cb817cc6238328ea1b,"BANGKOK (AP) — China’s President Xi Jinping met with private sector business leaders on Monday, offering them assurances that policies regarding the private sector would not change, state media reported, as government officials work to revive an economy disrupted by a pandemic, regulatory crackdowns and a real estate crisis. Among those present was Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who was part of a focus on a crackdown on the tech industry in recent years. Xi told the audience that the Communist Party and the government’s approach towards the private sector has been incorporated into “the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,” which is how the party describes its governance, according to state broadcaster CCTV. “They cannot and will not change,” said Xi. The president also said the government would “sincerely protect the legal rights of private businesses and entrepreneurs, according to the law.” But, “at the same time, we must realize that our country is a socialist country ruled by law, and any type of illegal activities by enterprises cannot avoid investigation and punishment.” The words of assurance were made after Beijing launched a crackdown on the tech sector in 2020 to break down monopolies and implement strict data regulations. One of the most public faces of that crackdown was Ma, who founded e-commerce firm Alibaba in the 1990s and was once China’s richest man. He has kept a low profile with few public appearances in recent years after he publicly criticized China’s regulators and financial systems during a speech in Shanghai. Other business leaders at Monday’s meeting in Beijing were Zeng Yuqun, the chairman of battery developer CATL, Wang Chuanfu, chairman of electric cars manufacturer BYD, and Pony Ma, the CEO of Tencent, which owns WeChat, according to a video of the meeting from state broadcaster CCTV and a state media report. Xi said he hoped private businesses will continue to “get rich first, and then promote common prosperity,” a reference to a program to encourage development and close the wealth gap. Alibaba previously pledged $15.5 billion to the cause, while Tencent pledged $7.7 billion. Earlier on Monday, a two-paragraph report about the meeting which originally had been carried by state media was subsequently deleted. Instead, a search online revealed a shorter state media statement which had cut out the names of those present. A later readout of the meeting carried Xi’s speech, and mentioned the names of some of those present, but not Ma. Ma, one of the wealthiest men in the country, gave a speech in Oct 2020 in which he said regulators were too conservative. The government responded by scuttling his plans for Ant Group ‘s stock market debut. The finance-focused business grew out of Alipay, the popular digital payments system. It then forced Ant Group to restructure, dividing it into multiple independent businesses. Alibaba was also investigated and fined $2.8 billion for breaching antitrust rules. —- AP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report from Beijing.","China's Xi promises policy stability at meeting with business leaders, including Alibaba's Jack Ma",HUIZHONG WU,AP News,2025-02-17T05:38:50,2025-02-17T10:55:51,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250217006600315,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (Yonhap) -- A prominent former South Korean lawmaker on Monday called for the creation of an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and suggested considering the redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea to enhance regional security. Chung Mong-joon, a seven-term conservative politician and honorary chairman of the Seoul-based Asan Institute of Policy Studies, made the remarks, citing the growing security challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear missile threats and the military expansionism of Russia and China. ""South Korea is close to God but too close to China, too close to Russia, and too far from the U.S., and it is a big problem,"" Chung said in a speech during an event at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Washington. Chung quoted the famous phrase, ""Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the U.S.,"" attributed to 19th century Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz, who used it to describe the challenges his country faced at the time from its powerful neighbor. ""The United States and its allies and partners need to show credible resolve to deter North Korean, Chinese and Russian military adventurism,"" Chung said. ""We need an Asian version of NATO."" Chung suggested naming the group the ""Indo-Pacific Treaty Organization (IPTO)."" Chung said it was ""not convincing"" that the U.S. has kept its tactical nuclear weapons away from the Korean Peninsula where the security situation is ""more severe"" than in Europe, despite maintaining around 100 such weapons there. ""The redeployment of some of these weapons to the bases in South Korea needs to be considered,"" he said. Chung went on to suggest that the U.S. and its treaty allies, like South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Thailand, should strengthen minilateral security cooperation, as well as with partners like India and Indonesia. ""This is not about containment or regime change of a sovereign state. It is about ensuring that the sovereignty of all countries in the Indo-Pacific is respected so that we can live free from coercion,"" Chung said. ""It will ensure that we can continue to co-exist, maintain economic relations and avoid all-out war,"" he said. Chung, who led the major South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries, said South Korea has ""much to contribute,"" regarding the U.S. President Donald Trump's interest in cooperating with Seoul on shipbuilding. Monday's event was held as SAIS established a distinguished chair in security studies in Chung's name, funded by his US$7.5 million donation.

https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2025/february/name-1041143-en.html,"RICHMOND, VA – Governor Glenn Youngkin announced today that he submitted an Expedited Major Disaster Declaration to President Donald J. Trump to support the ongoing response and recovery efforts of communities impacted by the recent winter storms.

“Over the past week, the Commonwealth has been hit extremely hard, particularly in areas that are still recovering from Hurricane Helene,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “This is the fifth major flood in this area in the past five years and there is significant damage that is affecting community lifelines. It is critical that we provide relief, and we will certainly take every measure possible to ensure that these areas are able to make a full recovery as quickly as possible. I want to thank our state and local agencies, and our federal, state and local elected officials for the incredible collaboration, and our first responders who have courageously made more than 150 swift water rescues and facilitated emergency operations that have saved lives throughout these storms.”

As the winter storms and flooding moved in, over seven inches of rain fell in some areas of Southwest Virginia with significant life-threatening flash flooding across Virginia’s most vulnerable and least resourced areas, resulting in historic river crests on the James River and other major waterways that have not been seen in the commonwealth since 1977. This resulted in critical infrastructure damages, over 203,000 customers without power at its peak, over 270 road closures including low water bridge and road washouts, and 9-1-1 center outages. The towns of Grundy and Hurley (Buchanan County) have experienced catastrophic flooding, with the river gauges in these towns spiking historical flood levels. Throughout the regions, over 150 swift water rescues, including evacuations, were made on Sunday, February 16. Support efforts continue as high water is blocking access to critical facilities, and access to the hardest hit areas is not yet available due to receding water and debris.

SUMMARY OF ALL EMERGENCY ACTIONS TAKEN

A State of Emergency was declared by Governor Youngkin on February 10, 2025.

The Virginia Emergency Support Team has been monitoring the forecast and activated the state emergency operations center to Yellow: Increased Readiness on 2 and moved to Red: Full Activation on 2 at 0700 to coordinate activities related to the storm.

The Logistics Support and Coordination Center is fully staffed and remains ready to deploy emergency response assets and supplies as needed to affected areas.

VDEM’s Regional Coordination Centers (RCC) were stood up across the commonwealth to coordinate local resource requests and needs.

VDEM is working with localities to assess the need to support residents without power with food, water, and resources for local warming centers as requested.

VDEM is coordinating and deploying water, meals, generators, and mass care supplies in support of ongoing local response and sheltering efforts.

Two Incident Management Type 1 Teams deployed to Southwest Virginia’s RCC to support the region.

VDEM is coordinating with the Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD) to provide support to the communities.

The VEST has held several calls with local elected officials to keep them updated on current impacts and response operations.

Swiftwater teams from the State Water Rescue Program from as far away as Virginia Beach were staged in Bristol, Wytheville, Lebanon and Norton These locations are used as starting points to access portions of Southwest Virginia quickly.

Two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters are also on station in the Southwest Virginia area and available for missions as needed through the weekend.

The VNG Black Hawk crews and Chesterfield Fire & Emergency Medical Services rescue technicians form the Virginia Helicopter Aquatic Rescue Team to provide rotary wing aviation hoist capabilities and aerial rescue evacuation. Four VNG Soldiers and three Chesterfield techs make up each HART crew.

Over 150 swift water rescues, including evacuations, have been performed.

Approximately 55 Virginia National Guard (VNG) Soldiers and Airmen provided commodity distribution, transportation and chain saw teams for debris reduction on Saturday, February 15, in Southwest Virginia. They are staged in Abingdon, Cedar Bluff and Wytheville and available for missions on Sunday, February 16.

VNG Soldiers linked up late Sunday evening with Richlands Fire Rescue Department to assist overnight with clearing debris and providing transportation assistance. Soldiers assisted evacuating 52 adults, 12 children, four infants and 26 pets to safety.

VNG Soldiers completed two missions on Saturday, February 15, assisting with commodity distribution in Dublin and debris reduction in Richlands.

The VNG conducted nine missions on February 14 and 15, distributing nearly 930 cases of water and more than 590 cases of food in Dublin, Hillsville, Pulaski and Rocky Mount. Soldiers cleared 13 trees and other debris in the vicinity of Fancy Gap.

Virginia State Police (VSP) adjusted manpower both on the roads and in dispatch centers to ensure that the department could respond efficiently to each crash. Additional troopers were brought in from across the state to support flooded areas in southwest Virginia.

VSP provided UAS capabilities to assist with damage assessment and has also staged Aviation resources in the region prior to the storm to mitigate impacts and assess damages as soon as the weather allows.

Virginia State Police troopers have been helping check on homes, assisting the Sheriff's Offices with calls, conducting rescues, and helping with detours. The evening of February 15, VSP rescued 6 people from cars in Buchanan.

In addition, VSP is providing the following assistance:

Multiple VSP swift water rescue teams are deployed, including troops and boats.

Three helicopters are staged in Abingdon for rescue missions and damage assessment.

VSP also has UTVs and drone teams on site.

Mobile Command Post was sent to Buchanan County at the Keen Mountain Correctional Center.

Communications techs are on site with a radio cache (30) and 2 satellite phones.

VSP brought in two squads, 28 trooper and 4 sergeants, from two other divisions for additional assistance

VSP Incident Management Team has also been deployed

VSP has an additional helicopter in Lynchburg and three in Chesterfield ready to respond.

As of Sunday, February 16, at 6:30 a.m., there are 12 primary roads and 234 secondary roads closed due to flooding, downed trees or utility lines. These closures are located in the Bristol, Culpeper, Lynchburg, Salem and Staunton districts. VDOT is actively responding.

Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) crews continue working 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, to address impacts from this latest storm. Additional resources are being deployed from less affected parts of the state to areas that experienced greater impacts.

Virginia Department of Forestry Forest Wardens are supporting fire department flood responses and swift water rescues in the counties of Bland, Buchanan, Dickenson, Russell, Smyth, Tazewell and Wise.

A portion of DOF’s Western Region Incident Management Team is working to coordinate the response and is provide logistical support of the agencies ongoing response efforts.

DOF will continue to provide staffing of both the state EOC and its agency command center in Charlottesville.

The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation’s Breaks Interstate Park Law Enforcement Rangers assisted local jurisdictions with flood response in Buchanan County.

The Virginia Department of Health is monitoring the commonwealth’s public health issues related to the current inclement weather.

PERSONAL PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS

As communities continue to face flooding concerns, below are some flood safety and preparedness tips.

Failing to evacuate flooded areas, entering flood waters, or remaining after a flood has passed can result in injury or death. Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States.

Remember that flash floods can come with no warning. They can cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings, and create landslides.

Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown!

Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.

Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.

Stay away from downed wires and do not approach or touch trees or limbs that are entangled with wires as they could be extremely dangerous. If those are in state maintained roadways, VDOT crews must await the power company to remove any electrical hazard before addressing downed trees or other roadway debris.

Power outages are affecting traffic signals in some areas. Treat all inoperable traffic signals as four-way stops.

For questions or to report hazardous road conditions such as flooding or downed trees and powerlines, contact VDOT’s 24-hour Customer Service Center by visiting	my.vdot.virginia.govor calling 800-FOR-ROAD (367-7623).

Check roadway conditions by using VDOT’s free 511 mobile app, which offers information about road conditions, traffic, incidents, construction and congestion as well as access to traffic cameras, weather and more. Information is also available at 511.vdot.virginia.gov or by calling 511 while in Virginia.

Visit VDOT’s Districts webpage for more details in your area.

Determine how best to protect yourself based on the type of flooding.

Evacuate if told to do so.

Move to higher ground or a higher floor.

Stay where you are.

How to prepare for flooding:

Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts.

If flash flooding is a risk in your location, then monitor potential signs, such as heavy rain.

Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response.

Gather supplies in case you have to leave immediately, or if services are cut off. Keep in mind each person’s specific needs, including medication. Don’t forget the needs of pets. Obtain extra batteries and charging devices for phones and other critical equipment.

Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies.

Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters.

What to do during a flood:

Depending on where you are, and the impact and the warning time of flooding, go to the safe location that you previously identified.

If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Never drive around barricades. Local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of flooded areas.

Listen to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions.

Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown!

Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning.

If your vehicle is trapped in rapidly moving water, then stay inside. If water is rising inside the vehicle, then seek refuge on the roof.

If trapped in a building, then go to its highest level. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising floodwater. Go on the roof only if necessary. Once there, signal for help.

Be safe after a flood:

Listen to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.

Avoid driving, except in emergencies.

Wear heavy gloves and boots during clean up.

Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off the electricity to prevent electric shock.

Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris and be contaminated. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.

Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.

Cleaning up from a flood:

Personal safety is always the highest priority when entering buildings damaged by floodwater.

Check for structural damage before re-entering your home to avoid being trapped in a building collapse.

Keep power off until an electrician has inspected your system for safety.

Turn off the gas. Be alert for gas leaks.

Look before you step. After a flood, the ground and floors are covered with debris, including broken bottles and nails. Floors and stairs that have been covered with mud can be very slippery.

Take photos of any floodwater in your home and of damaged items for insurance purposes.

Rescue the most valuable items but never attempt to salvage belongings at the expense of your own safety.

Wear long sleeves, sturdy shoes or waterproof boots, and plastic or rubber gloves during cleanup.

Wash your hands often with soap and clean water or use a hand-cleaning gel with alcohol in it.

Mold can form within 48 hours; you will need to work fast. If you do encounter extensive mold, use protective gear such as gloves, goggles, and an N95 or N100 face mask, available at most hardware stores.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers guidelines for mold cleanup after floods.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a number of helpful resources, about hazards you may encounter when cleaning up inside and outside your home.

Emergency Alerts

These days, emergency alerts can reach you in so many ways–WEA (Wireless Emergency Alerts) come to your cell phone, EAS (Emergency Alert System) on TV and Radio, NOAA weather radio alerts, mobile apps and more. It’s important to have several different ways you can receive emergency alerts, and to be armed with the knowledge you need before an emergency happens.

Know the current forecast and get alerted for any watches, warnings, or advisories on the National Weather Service’s website

Download FEMA app and local news apps for severe weather alerts

Sign up to receive alerts on your phone, tune in to your local weather station, or listen to your NOAA Weather Radio

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wewj551q0o,"At least 10 people have died as torrential downpours over the weekend drenched parts of the south-eastern US, submerging roads and houses. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said nine people have died in his state, after making an emergency disaster declaration. About 1,000 people stranded in flood waters had to be rescued, he also said on Sunday. The same areas could now be affected by drier but colder conditions, and the risk of snow, ice and significant disruption - according to BBC forecaster John Hutchinson. The other death over the weekend was in Georgia, where a man lying in his bed was struck by an uprooted tree that crashed into his home. Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina were under some type of storm-related alert over the weekend. Almost all of those states also suffered catastrophic damage in September from Hurricane Helene. Hundreds of thousands of homes ended up without power - a number that reduced to tens of thousands early on Monday, according to monitoring site Poweroutage.us. Some parts of Kentucky received up to 6in (15cm) of rain, National Weather Service (NWS) figures show, resulting in widespread flooding issues. The rapid influx of rain caused river levels to rise quickly and trapped vehicles in feet of water, images posted online show. Hundreds of roads were closed. Among those who died in the state were a mother and her seven-year-old child, and a 73-year-old man. A resident of rain-lashed Knott County told CNN he was anxious he would ""lose everything again"", as he was still rebuilding his home from devastating flooding two years previously. Danny Laferty told the broadcaster the type of flooding he had seen in recent years was ""different"". Beshear said that he had written to the White House requesting an emergency disaster declaration and federal funds for affected areas. President Donald Trump approved the declaration on Sunday, authorising the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) - which he has suggested abolishing - to co-ordinate disaster relief efforts. In Obion County, Tennessee, heavy rains caused a levee to break, ""resulting in rapid onset flooding"", according to an X account for the local National Weather Service (NWS) station. The town of Rives along the Obion River, with a population of about 300 people, was deluged from the breached flood barrier. Footage showed brown water rushing over rocks and past trees, as rescue workers in red boats passed flooded homes. Steve Carr, the Obion County mayor, declared a state of emergency himself, ordering mandatory evacuations in Rives. Meanwhile, West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey issued his own state of emergency in more than a dozen counties over the weekend. Kristi Noem, head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees Fema, said she had been in contact with the governors of affected states. ""While emergency management is best led by local authorities, we reinforced that DHS stands ready to take immediate action to offer resources and support,"" Noem said. The same weather system is now bringing heavy snow to parts of Canada. Meanwhile, the NWS warns that arctic air could bring record-breaking cold and dangerous wind chills to the central US this week.",At least 10 dead in US floods and heavy rain,Brandon Drenon,BBC News,2025-02-16T15:51:10,2025-02-17T06:21:02,gemini-2.0-flash

State broadcaster CCTV reported that the 330-metre (1,080ft) floating production storage and offloading unit (FPSO) would be delivered at the end of this month. The unit, developed by state-owned Cosco Ocean Shipping Heavy Industry Company, is designed to carry carbon capture and storage equipment and has a production capacity of up to 120,000 barrels of crude oil a day. It is unique in that it not only captures the carbon dioxide it releases, but also generates electricity from the heat of the exhaust gases, achieving the twin goals of environmental protection and energy savings. The technology “marks an important step for China in the field of offshore carbon capture”, CCTV reported. Oil and gas production releases a large amount of carbon dioxide each year. According to the International Energy Agency, the extraction, transport and processing of oil and gas produced 5.1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, accounting for around 15 per cent of total global energy-related emissions. However, it highlighted a number of measures that could help mitigate the problem, such as the use of low-emission electricity at upstream facilities and the use of carbon capture technologies.",China unveils world’s first oil production ship with carbon capture facilities,Dannie Peng,South China Morning Post,2025-02-16T13:30:08,2025-02-16T13:30:08,gemini-2.0-flash

The heavy rain Saturday evening has caused a levee there to break, and floodwaters are pouring into the surrounding area. Emergency officials are calling it a life-threatening situation. ""It’s worse than I have seen it before. It’s truly a life-threatening event,"" Rives Fire Chief Campbell Rice said. The small-town community of Rives, Tenn., looks more like a lake as rising floodwaters swallow lawns and cars Sunday afternoon. ""We had the saturated ground, and the rivers were all full. And just all of a sudden we were inundated with water,"" Rice said. Obion County Mayor Steve Carr issued a mandatory evacuation for people living in Rives due to the rising water and no electricity. ""If anybody tries to stay there, they are not going to have any electricity or heat, and we are about to have subfreezing temperatures moving in tonight, so it is going to be a very dangerous situation,"" he said. Mayor Carr, made the declaration in a post to his Facebook page, saying: According to a post on their X page, the National Weather Service in Memphis said the levee near Rives in Obion County had failed Sunday morning, resulting in ""rapid onset flooding of the town of Rives and surrounding areas."" Water rescues are now underway as emergency crews take boats door to door. The Millington Fire Department said it sent a water rescue team of six people and equipment to Rives, adding that additional water rescue teams from Collierville, Tipton County and Madison County had been dispatched as well. ""Fire administration was notified at 7:30 this morning of extensive flooding in the area, and the request for water teams was issued,"" the department wrote in a post to X. ""The teams have arrived in the area and have boats in the water conducting recon missions of flooded properties in that community."" ""We did have some folks that have gotten cold and wet, and they’ve been taken to the hospital for treatment, but we’ve had no serious injuries or deaths, so we are thankful for that,"" Carr said.

https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-warns-of-russian-military-buildup-potential-nato-threat-in-2026/,"Russia is possibly preparing for a major military escalation, potentially targeting NATO countries next year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said that Russia plans to deploy 15 divisions, totaling 100,000 to 150,000 troops, primarily inBelarus, a Kyiv Independent journalist reported from the event. While the buildup could focus onUkraine, he cautioned thatRussian forcesmight shift toward Poland or the Baltics, raising concerns about a broader conflict with NATO. ""Based on all the information I've gathered from intelligence and other sources, I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is preparing for war againstNATOcountries next year,"" Zelensky said, but added he ""canâ	 be 100 percent certain."" ""Just like in 2022, they could move forward towards Ukraine, or they could go to Poland or the Baltics. And I believe this is his idea,"" he said. ""God bless, we will stop this crazy guy,"" Zelensky added. The president also warned that without NATO membership, Ukraine must build a self-sufficientmilitarycapable of defending its sovereignty. ""This means the appropriate NATO weaponry and a sufficient number of our Ukrainian soldiers,"" he said. According to Zelensky, Ukraine would require an army numbering 1.5 millionsoldiers. Last month, he said the current total of those serving in Ukraine's armed forces was 880,000. This statement comes as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the U.S. does not consider Ukraine's NATO accession a ""realistic outcome"" of negotiations. U.S. President Donald Trump choed thisstance, saying that he does not believe Ukraine joining the alliance is practical. Zelenskyearlier reported that Ukraine fields 110 brigades, while Russia has 220 brigades and plans to expand to 250 this year.Europe, including U.S. troops stationed there, has only about 82 combat brigades.

Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said the day previously that Europe would not be directly involved in peace talks. A new European special envoy, Stubb said, would help focus European efforts and give them a voice in such talks. ""If there is a negotiating table, I think we need to do something similar to what was done in Kosovo. Europe needs to have a special envoy,"" Stubb said. ""And then, a deputy envoy, who is on the level of Kellogg, (Steve) Witkoff, (Andriy) Yermak, or (Yuriy) Ushakov."" Earlier, Politico reported that U.S. officials were heading to Saudi Arabia to meet with Russian representatives for talks meant to lay the ground work for a potential summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kyiv was not invited and was even surprised by the announced meeting in Saudi Arabia, causing alarm that negotiations to end Russia's nearly three year invasion will happen without Ukraine's involvement. Croation Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic voiced a similar sentiment as Stubb, saying that Europe needs a strong representative in negotiations, Reuters reported.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4jj0p5jdo,"A stabbing in Austria that killed a 14-year-old boy and wounded five others was an Islamist attack, Austrian officials have said. The attack took place on Saturday at Villach, a town near the border with Italy and Slovenia, and three of those who were injured remain in intensive care, authorities said. A 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker, who was detained at the scene, has been charged with murder and attempted murder. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said an Islamic State group flag had been found in the suspect's apartment, while state police chief Michaela Kohlweiss said he had sworn allegiance to the group. Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Karner said this was an ""Islamist attack with IS links by an attacker who, according to the investigations so far, was obviously radicalised online, via the internet, within a very short space of time"". ""So those in a position of responsibility, the police, the authorities, must draw the necessary conclusions from that."" Karner said the suspect had a valid residence permit, no criminal record, and had not previously attracted the attention of authorities. Authorities previously said the suspect had a temporary residence permit and was waiting for a decision on his asylum application. The attack took place around 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) near the town's main square. On Sunday, officials confirmed the ages of those who were injured: Two 15-year-olds, with the other victims aged 28, 32 and 36. Five of them are Austrian nationals and one is Turkish. Three are in intensive care, one is in a stable condition and another is receiving outpatient treatment. A delivery worker, also a Syrian man, who had driven his vehicle at the attacker helped prevent more injuries, police said. The attack comes amid a national debate over asylum laws and an election last year that saw the far-right Freedom Party come out on top for the first time. The party has failed to form a coalition government, leaving Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen weighing up whether to call a snap election, form a minority government or invite other parties or a group of experts to try and form an administration. Herbert Kickl, the head of the Freedom Party, seized on the Villach attack, saying on Saturday that Austria needs a ""rigorous crackdown on asylum"". On Sunday, Karner said there needed to be ""legal reforms"" for police and authorities and called for screenings of certain groups, such as asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan.","Austria attack that killed teen linked to IS, officials say",Alex Therrien,BBC News,2025-02-16T06:41:26,2025-02-16T08:47:01,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/congo-m23-rebels-bukavu-southkivu-14527185304baa9a5e40eff4cfccba85,"BUKAVU, Congo (AP) — Rwanda-backed rebelshave occupied a second major city in mineral-rich eastern Congo, the government said Sunday, as M23 rebels confirmed they were in the city to restore order after it was abandoned by Congolese forces. The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes the M23, said in a statement that its fighters “decided to assist the population of Bukavu” in addressing its security challenges under the “old regime” in the city of 1.3 million people. “Our forces have been working to restore the security for the people and their property, much to the satisfaction of the entire population,” alliance spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said in a statement. The rebels sawlittle resistance from government forcesagainst the unprecedented expansion of their reach afteryears of fighting. Congo’s government vowed to restore order in Bukavu but there was no sign of soldiers. Many were seen fleeing on Saturday alongside thousands of civilians. The M23 are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo’s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth that’s critical for much of the world’s technology. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the United Nations experts. The fighting has displaced more than 6 million people in the region, creating the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Rebels vow to ‘clean up’ disorder Bernard Maheshe Byamungu, one of the M23 leaders who has been sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council for rights abuses, stood in front of the South Kivu governor’s office in Bukavu and told residents they have been living in a “jungle.” “We are going to clean up the disorder left over from the old regime,” Byamungu said, as some in the small crowd of young men cheered the rebels on to “go all the way to Kinshasa,” Congo’s capital, nearly 1,000 miles away. Congo’s communications ministry in a statement on social media acknowledged for the first time that Bukavu had been “occupied” and said the national government was “doing everything possible to restore order and territorial integrity” in the region. One Bukavu resident, Blaise Byamungu, said the rebels marched into the city that had been “abandoned by all the authorities and without any loyalist force.” “Is the government waiting for them to take over other towns to take action? It’s cowardice,” Byamungu added. Fears of regional escalation Unlike in 2012, when the M23 briefly seized Goma and withdrew after international pressure, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power. The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. The M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the militia group is “fully integrated” into the Congolese military, which denies it. But the new face of the M23 in the region — Corneille Nangaa — is not Tutsi, giving the group “a new, more diverse, Congolese face, as M23 has always been seen as a Rwanda-backed armed group defending Tutsi minorities,” according to Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol. Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi, whose government on Saturday asserted that Bukavu remained under its control, has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo’s forces were being supported in Goma by troops from South Africa and in Bukavu by troops from Burundi. But Burundi’s president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest on social media his country would not retaliate in the fighting. The conflict was high on the African Union summit’s agenda in Ethiopia over the weekend, with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warning it risked spiraling into a regional conflagration. Still, African leaders and the international community have been reluctant to take decisive action against M23 or Rwanda, which has one of Africa’s most powerful militaries. Most continue to call for a ceasefire and a dialogue between Congo and the rebels. ___ Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria.",Rwanda-backed rebels reach the center of east Congo’s Bukavu,"Chinedu Asadu, Pascal Cinamula, Janvier Barhahiga",AP News,2025-02-16T09:56:18,2025-02-17T06:16:39,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4egp7lwno,"Mouldy half-finished food on bunk beds, discarded military uniforms and abandoned weapons - these are the remnants of an abrupt retreat from this base that once belonged to Iran and its affiliated groups in Syria. The scene tells a story of panic. The forces stationed here fled with little warning, leaving behind a decade-long presence that unravelled in mere weeks. Iran was Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most critical ally for more than 10 years. It deployed military advisers, mobilised foreign militias, and invested heavily in Syria's war. Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) built deep networks of underground bases, supplying arms and training to thousands of fighters. For Iran, this was also part of its ""security belt"" against Israel. We are near Khan Shaykhun town in Idlib province. Before Assad's regime fell on 8 December, it was one of the key strategic locations for the IRGC and its allied groups. From the main road, the entrance is barely visible, hidden behind piles of sand and rocks. A watchtower on a hilltop, still painted in the colours of the Iranian flag, overlooks the base. A receipt notebook confirms the base's name: The Position of Martyr Zahedi -  named after Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander who was assassinated in an alleged Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria on 1 April, 2024. The supplies recently ordered - we found receipts for chocolates, rice, cooking oil - suggest daily life continued here until the last moments. But now the base has new occupants - two armed Uyghur fighters from Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist militant group whose leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has become the new interim president of Syria. The Uyghurs arrived suddenly in a military vehicle, asking for our media accreditation. ""Iranians were here. They all fled,"" one of them says, speaking in his mother tongue, a dialect of Turkish. ""Whatever you see here is from them. Even these onions and the leftover foods."" Boxes full of fresh onions in the courtyard have now germinated. The base is a labyrinth of tunnels dug deep into white rocky hills. There are bunk beds in some rooms with no windows. The roof of one of the corridors is draped in fabric in the colours of the Iranian flag and there are a few Persian books on a rocky shelf. They left behind documents containing sensitive information. All in Persian, they have details of fighters' personal information, military personnel codes, home addresses, spouses' names and mobile phone numbers in Iran. From the names, it's clear that several fighters in this base were from the Afghan brigade that was formed by Iran to fight in Syria. Sources linked to Iran-backed groups told BBC Persian that the base houses mainly Afghan forces accompanied by Iranian ""military advisers"" and their Iranian commanders. Tehran's main justification for its military involvement in Syria was ""to fight against jihadi groups"" and to protect ""Shia holy shrines"" against radical Sunni militants. It created paramilitary groups of mainly Afghan, Pakistani and Iraqi fighters. Yet, when the final moment came, Iran was unprepared. Orders for retreat reached some bases at the very last moment. ""Developments happened so fast,"" a senior member of an Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary group tells me. ""The order was to just take your backpack and leave."" Multiple sources close to the IRGC told the BBC that most of the forces had to flee to Iraq, and some were ordered to go to Lebanon or Russian bases to be evacuated from Syria by the Russians. An HTS fighter, Mohammad al Rabbat, had witnessed the group's advance from Idlib to Aleppo and Syria's capital Damascus. He says they thought their operation would take ""about a year"" and best, they'd ""capture Aleppo in three to six months"". But to their surprise, they entered Aleppo in a matter of days. The regime's rapid downfall was brought about by a chain of events after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel. That attack led to an escalation of Israeli air strikes against the IRGC and Iran-backed groups in Syria and a war against another key Iranian ally – the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose leader was killed in an air strike. This ""situation of psychological collapse"" for Iran and Hezbollah was central to their downfall, says 35-year-old fighter Rabbat. But the most crucial blow came from within: there was a rift between Assad and his Iran-linked allies, he says. ""There was a complete breakdown of trust and military co-operation between them. IRGC-linked groups were blaming Assad of betrayal and believing that he is giving up their locations to Israel."" As we pass through Khan Shaykhun, we come across a street painted in the colours of the Iranian flag. It leads to a school building that was being used as an Iranian headquarters. On the wall at the entrance of the toilets, slogans read: ""Down with Israel"" and ""Down with the USA"". It was evident that these headquarters were also evacuated at short notice. We found documents classified as ""highly sensitive"". Abdullah, 65, and his family are among the very few locals who stayed and lived here alongside the IRGC-led groups. He says this life was hard. His house is only a few metres away from the headquarters and in between, there are deep trenches with barbed wire. ""Movement at night was prohibited,"" he says. His neighbour's home was turned into a military post. ""They sat there with their guns pointing at the road, treating us all as suspects,"" he recalls. Most of the fighters didn't even speak Arabic, he says. ""They were Afghans, Iranians, Hezbollah. But we referred to them all as Iranians because Iran was controlling them."" Abdullah's wife Jourieh says she is happy that the ""Iranian militias"" have left, but still remembers the ""stressful"" moment before their withdrawal. She had thought they would be trapped in crossfire as Iran-backed groups were fortifying their positions and getting ready to fight, but then ""they just vanished in a few hours"". ""This was an occupation. Iranian occupation,"" says Abdo who, like others, has just returned here with his family after 10 years. His house had also become a military base. I observed this anger towards Iran and a softer attitude towards Russia in many conversations with Syrians. I asked Rabbat, the HTS fighter, why this was. ""Russians were dropping bombs from the sky and other than that, they were in their bases while Iranians and their militias were on the ground interacting. People were feeling their presence, and many weren't happy with it,"" he explained. This feeling is reflected in Syria's new rulers' policy towards Iran. The new authorities have put a ban on Iranian nationals, alongside Israelis, entering Syria. But there is no such ban against Russians. Iran's embassy, which was stormed by angry protesters after the fall of the regime, remains closed. The reaction of Iranian officials towards developments in Syria has been contradictory. While supreme leader Ali Khamenei called on ""Syrian youths"" to ""resist"" those who ""have brought instability"" to Syria, Iran's foreign ministry has taken a more balanced view. It says the country ""backs any government supported by the Syrian people"". In one of his first interviews, Syria's new leader Sharaa described their victory over Assad as an ""end of the Iranian project"". But he hasn't ruled out having a ""balanced"" relationship with Tehran. For the moment, though, Iran is not welcome in Syria. After years of expanding its military presence, everything Tehran built is now in ruins, both on the battlefield and, it seems, in the eyes of a large part of Syria's public. Back at the abandoned base, Iran's military expansion was still under way even in the last days. Next to the camp were more tunnels under construction, apparently the beginnings of a field hospital. The cement on the walls was still wet and the paint fresh. But left behind now is evidence of a brief fight - a few bullet shells and a military uniform covered with blood. The delay comes after Washington imposed new sanctions targeting Iran on Wednesday. The sectarian violence involving Islamist factions, security forces and Druze gunmen is another sign of the fragile security situation. The strikes were south of Damascus, where Syrian security forces say they are battling gunmen from the religious minority. The interior minister said ""some individuals deemed responsible"" for Saturday's blast at Shahid Rajaee are being questioned. A blame game begins amid reports solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles may have been improperly stored. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Speaking hours after US President Donald Trump again threatened to impose tariffs on Taiwanese semiconductors, Lai said the government would act prudently, strengthen communications with the US and promote greater mutual understanding. Lai also touted an initiative to promote semiconductor supply chain partnerships for global democracies, saying that Taiwan would collaborate with the US and other democratic partners to facilitate a more resilient and diversified semiconductor supply chain. Such a supply chain would form the basis for a global alliance on chips for artificial intelligence (AI) and ensure industries in democratic nations have access to high-end chips, he said. This would open up a new era of growth for the international semiconductor industry, he added. Taiwan will continue to highlight that bilateral cooperation is mutually beneficial, and to communicate and negotiate closely with Washington to help the US administration better understand that Taiwan is an indispensable partner in rebuilding US manufacturing and consolidating its technological leadership, Lai said. The Executive Yuan will explore all possible trade opportunities with the US, and hopes to balance bilateral trade by stepping up investments in the US and purchasing US goods, he said. Taiwan has always been one of the most reliable trade partners of the US, as well as one of the most essential cooperative partners of US companies in the semiconductor industry, he added. Taiwan has significantly increased its investment in the US, which was valued at US$100 billion and had created nearly 400,000 jobs as of last year, Lai said. Taiwanese investment in the US in 2023 and last year accounted for at least 40 percent of the nation’s total foreign investment, he said. That far exceeded Taiwanese investment in China, which accounted for 11 percent in 2023 and only 8 percent last year, he added. Taiwan will step up collaborative efforts with the US in the development of AI and semiconductors, and work to maintain order in the chip market, Lai said.",Taiwan to increase its investment in US: Lai,Su Yung-yao and Jake Chung,Taipei Times,2025-02-15T00:00:00,2025-02-14T23:40:13,gemini-2.0-flash

The testimonies of Sagui Dekel-Chen, Iair Horn, and Sasha Troufanov were shared with N12 and KAN. N12 reported that Hamas wrongly insisted that some of the hostages were soldiers, using continual interrogation and torture to try to obtain intelligence from them. The hostages were held in extremely unhealthy environments, including in tunnels and hiding places, which were full of lice, bedbugs, mold, and mildew. They also received almost no food and drank only salt water, which was not fit for drinking. N12 added that because many of the hostages were wounded by Hamas terrorists and did not receive proper medical treatment, they may have to undergo surgery. Before their release, the terrorists forced the hostages to write letters of gratitude while documenting them. Horn was held captive for a while with his brother Eitan, who remains in Hamas captivity. He spent most of his time in the Hamas tunnels but was held with other hostages, so he was able to provide Israel with signs of life from those he was held with. Dekel-Chen was interrogated throughout his time in captivity, including through physical torture, N12 said. This has resulted in physical scars on his body. KAN added that he was shot in the right shoulder on October 7 but told IDF officers after his release to leave the wound alone as “the most important thing is for me to meet my family now.” He was also unaware of his family’s fate, cut off from all means of communication for nearly 15 months. During the hostage release, Hamas told him that his wife had given birth to a daughter while he was in captivity, which he didn’t believe until it was confirmed by the IDF. Troufanov was held alone throughout his time in captivity, KAN claimed. He was told by the IDF after his release that his father, Vitaly, had been murdered and burst into tears. Dekel-Chen, Horn, and Troufanov were all held in Khan Yunis in tunnels up until very recently when they were moved to apartments above ground.",Three released hostages reveal horrific details of Hamas captivity,MATHILDA HELLER,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-15T19:43:00,2025-02-16T13:17:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2483zrz0zo,"Imposing US tariffs on UK steel would be ""negative"" for both countries, the business secretary has said. Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK and US have a ""mutual interest"" in negotiating an exemption from President Donald Trump's plans for the 25% import tax, which could come into force in March. He said the UK was in a different trading position to other countries and could offer ""very specialised"" steel and aluminium exports the US needs like Navy submarine casings made in Sheffield, while tariffs would push up costs for US taxpayers. Reynolds' comments came after the government promised up to Â£2.5bn in support for the UK steel industry. President Trump has said his tariffs would be enforced ""without exceptions or exemptions"". However, Reynolds told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that imposing them on UK steel ""would be negative for ourselves, it would be negative for the US as well"". He said he has had ""some very constructive conversations with key people in the Trump administration recognising our relationship is different"", including the US special envoy to the UK. The minister told the programme he thought there was a basis for ""constructive engagement"" between the UK and US but ""I'm not saying it's easy"". He added: ""I appreciate they have a mandate for changing how they approach the issues of trade, but we have got a different argument, a different story to tell, to the EU or to China in relation to our trading relationships."" The government has already said it would not retaliate immediately to the tariffs announced by Trump. UK Steel, which represents the industry, has said the tariffs would be a ""devastating blow"" that would damage the sector's Â£400m-a-year contribution to UK-US trade. The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. But there are concerns within the industry the tariffs might not just hinder exports to the US, but also lead to excess steel being ""dumped"" in the UK. This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut. Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the ""uncertainty"" the steel industry faced due to US tariffs was something the government ""has been entirely silent on when instead they should be talking to the US, our closest trading partner"". On Sunday, the government launched a consultation on its Plan for Steel, which will look at ways to reverse long-term issues facing the industry - including cheap imports flooding the domestic market. The UK steel industry has faced heavy job losses in recent years. Tata Steel is replacing old blast furnaces with an electric arc furnace - which is less energy-intensive and environmentally friendlier - at its site in Port Talbot, Wales. Traditional steelmaking at the siteceased in September,resulting in 2,800 job cuts. British Steel announced in 2023 it wouldclose blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, and unveiled plans to roll out an electric arc furnace, which requires fewer workers to keep it going, with2,000 jobs under threat. Asked about the potential job losses in Scunthorpe, Reynolds accepted that there would be a ""reduction in head count"" with the introduction of new technologies, but he said more jobs could be created if demand for UK steel was increased. The government's plan will address issues that have been ""holding the industry back for too long"", the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) said, including: The consultation will also examine electricity costs for steel companies ""to make the UK competitive globally"", but the government has not yet made a firm commitment to reduce energy bills. Griffiths said he looked forward to seeing a detailed plan, but added ""a clear part must be steps to reduce the cost of energy which is placing an intolerable strain on UK steel"". Help for the sector will be available through the National Wealth Fund, which partners the government with the private sector and local authorities to finance infrastructure and other projects. The government says this financial assistance could benefit Scotland, as well as areas of England such as Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, Rotherham and Redcar which have ""a strong history of steel production"". But the DBT said it was ""wasting no time"" supporting UK steel, pointing tothe government's backing an expansion of Heathrow Airport, which it said would require 400,000 tonnes of steel. The GMB union said the government's plan to support the ""beleaguered"" steel industry provided ""desperately needed"" funding after ""years of dithering"". ""As the world becomes more volatile, primary domestic steel making capacity is vital for both our economy and domestic security,"" the union's national secretary Andy Prendergast added. Gareth Stace, director-general of UK Steel, said the government's commitment to the industry was ""both vital and welcome"". Information gathered in the consultation will be used to help form a ""steel strategy"", to be launched in the spring. Stace added a robust strategy ""has the power to reverse the sector's decline, particularly as we face increasing competition from imports benefiting from more favourable business conditions"". The Liberal Democrats have said the government urgently needs to prepare for retaliatory tariff. Deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the UK steel industry was being left ""dangerously exposed"" to the ""devastating damage"" Trump's tariffs could inflict.","Trump steel tariffs negative for UK and US, says Reynolds",David Mercer & Vishala Sri-Pathma,BBC News,2025-02-15T19:56:02.196,2025-02-16T11:03:02.032,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250215001300320?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, Feb. 15 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Saturday reaffirmed its commitment to bolstering its defensive capabilities to deter what it calls ""provocative attempts"" by South Korea and the United States, the North's state media reported Saturday. 

 ""The DPRK's bolstering of its self-defensive capabilities is an essential requirement for deterring rivals' ever-increasing various provocative attempts and ensuring the security of the state,"" read a press statement of Pyongyang's defense policy chief, released by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

 DPRK is the acronym of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.


 The statement was released a day after the commander of the U.S. Northern Command, Gen. Gregory Guillot, said before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that the North's newest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) could pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland and overwhelm its defenses.

 Guillot said Pyongyang may be moving toward producing new ICBMs capable of striking North America. 

 Pyongyang's defense official slammed the U.S. general's remarks, accusing the U.S. of falsely charging North Korea of making ""threats"" that are ""nonexistent.""

 ""The U.S. describing this as a 'threat' only proves that it is hostile to the DPRK,"" the official said, noting the U.S. is trying to justify its ""adventurous military ambitions.""

 ""It is just self-defensive right of a sovereign state to steadily develop the self-defense capability,"" he added. 

 ""The armed forces of the DPRK will as ever fully deter and control all kinds of challenges and threats from its rival countries by dint of powerful self-defense capability and faithfully discharge their mission for reliably defending peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.""

 The North's defense policy chief also accused the U.S. of building a missile defense system aimed at preemptively attacking other countries and weaponizing outer space.

 He also condemned the U.S. nuclear submarine's recent trip to the Korean Peninsula and information sharing among Seoul, Washington and Tokyo, as well as Seoul's plan to hold joint military and space-related drills with the U.S.

Some 10,000 people were estimated to have gathered at Geumnam-ro, the city's central avenue, to participate in a massive prayer event, organized by a conservative Christian group, to oppose Yoon's ouster over his short-lived martial law bid in December. Geumnam-ro is the historic street symbolizing the May 18 pro-democracy uprising in Gwangju in 1980. Many people were killed and injured in Gwangju as the military brutally cracked down on protesters who rose up against the ruling junta led by Chun Doo-hwan. Saturday's protest came as the Constitutional Court has been holding Yoon's impeachment trials over his botched martial law bid. Yoon was also detained last month on charges of insurrection over his martial law bid. His supporters called for Yoon's immediate release from prison or verifying the election fraud allegations, cited by Yoon as a main reason for declaring martial law. Meanwhile, protesters calling for Yoon's ouster also gathered at Geumnam-ro, just across walls of police buses that were set up to prevent potential clashes between demonstrators from opposite ends of the political spectrum. Around 20,000 protesters, estimated by organizers, participated in the rally, chanting slogans, including ""Uphold Yoon's impeachment"" and ""Out, far-right forces."" Protesters in support of Yoon's removal denounced Yoon's supporters for using Geumnam-ro as a venue to advocate his martial law imposition. ""There is a saying that South Korea's democracy has grown, fed by the blood of Gwangju. We cannot tolerate (Yoon's supporters) defending his martial law bid and supporting the mastermind of insurrection at Geumnam-ro,"" Hwang Hyun-pil, a YouTuber and Korean history instructor, said.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/shin-bet-launches-inquiry-into-netanyahu-aides-ties-with-qatar/,"The Shin Bet said Saturday it has begun probing reports on the alleged ties between advisers to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar, the main financial backer of the terror group Hamas. In response to a query from The Democrats MK Gilad Kariv, the security service said that as the body responsible for “preventing espionage threats,” it has begun investigating the protection of state secrets in the Prime Minister’s Office and the personnel surrounding “protected persons,” a euphemism for the most senior Israeli officials. Responding to the development, Netanyahu’s office put out a statement accusing the Shin Bet of selective enforcement by not probing the premier’s political rivals. “We are used to false accusations about the Prime Minister’s Office,” the statement said, dismissing the allegations against the prime minister’s aides as “fake news.” The Shin Bet’s confirmation of the inquiry came after Hebrew media reported Friday that Eli Feldstein, Netanyahu’s former spokesman, was paid by Doha to feed top Israeli journalists pro-Qatar stories. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories According to Channel 12 news, Feldstein’s ties with Qatar, which serves as a mediator of the current hostage-ceasefire deal because of its influence over Hamas, emerged during an investigation that led to him being charged in November with harming national security in a case involving the theft and leaking of classified IDF documents. Eli Feldstein, a spokesman in the Prime Minister’s Office accused of leaking stolen IDF intelligence classified documents, arrives for a court hearing at the District Court in Tel Aviv, January 14, 2025. (Avshalom Sassoni) Feldstein’s alleged ties to Qatar, however, were left unexplored by investigators. The network cited a former defense official excoriating investigators for the reported oversight. The TV report also said Feldstein worked for Qatar via an international firm contracted by the Persian Gulf state. Meanwhile, Channel 13 news reported that Feldstein was hired by a Qatar-employed US strategist, who had interviewed several well-known publicists for the job. The reports prompted calls for a probe into Qatar’s influence in the Prime Minister’s Office, while The Democrats chairman Yair Golan demanded Netanyahu and his staff be investigated for treason. “It is not possible for people who have financial interests with a foreign country to be involved in managing matters critical to Israel’s national security,” Golan said in a statement welcoming the Shin Bet probe as ” a necessary step,” while calling for everybody involved in the matter to be removed from government service “immediately.” “The Shin Bet must thoroughly investigate not only the prime minister’s associates, but also the prime minister himself: Was he aware of these connections? Did he approve of them? And perhaps even worse — did he himself receive funds, directly or indirectly? This investigation must not be allowed to be hidden or scuttled. This is about Israel’s security and the lives of the hostages,” he stated. Israel has no diplomatic relations with Qatar, which hosts Hamas’s leadership. For years, with Netanyahu’s approval, Qatar transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to the terror group in Gaza. Qatar, along with Egypt and the United States, mediated the current ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, following 15 months of fighting that began on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages. It also helped mediate November 2023’s weeklong hostage-truce deal. Reports of Feldstein’s ties to Doha were first published on Monday, and follow reports in November that top Netanyahu aides Jonatan Urich and Yisrael Einhorn did public relations work for Qatar ahead of the 2022 World Cup there.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-943c9a5e-32c0-4eae-8abb-4d9c4c6eae1e,"President Donald Trump has made repeated claims that China “operates” the Panama Canal in recent weeks and has threatened to take back the waterway to block what he sees as Beijing’s increasing influence. A BBC Verify analysis shows that the US remains the main user of the canal, but Chinese involvement in infrastructure projects around the waterway - which is operated directly by Panama - has grown in recent years. Up to 14,000 ships use the 51-mile (82km) passage each year. It links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the Central American country, avoiding an otherwise lengthy and costly trip around South America. The waterway cuts the amount of time it takes goods to flow from Shenzhen in China to the US east coast, or between San Francisco and New York, by weeks. After Panama signed up to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2017 - where Beijing invests in infrastructure across the globe - Chinese companies were more active around the canal. Panama left the partnership earlier this month amid US pressure. However, much of Trump’s ire has been focused on Chinese control over ports which predate the BRI. There are five container ports around the Panama Canal. All of them are operated by foreign companies.  Three of the canal’s main container ports - Colon, Rodman and Manzanillo - are operated by companies based in Singapore, Taiwan and the US.  But much of the US attention has focused on the two biggest, Cristóbal and Balboa. They sit at either end of the canal and have been operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings since 1997.   While the company is a private corporation based outside the Chinese mainland, experts have told the BBC that the Chinese national security law introduced in 2020 could allow China to exercise influence over Hong Kong-based companies in the event of a conflict.  “In terms of the day-to-day, I’m sceptical as to whether there’s a direct line between Beijing and CK Hutchison, but in a time of a crisis or a conflict it would be relatively trivial for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to say we’re going to use the ports,” Henry Ziemer, an Americas specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told the BBC.  This view was echoed by the former commander of the US military’s southern command, Gen Laura J Richardson. She told lawmakers in 2023 that “in any potential global conflict, the PRC [China] could leverage strategic regional ports to restrict US naval and commercial ship access”.  The chairman of CK Hutchison - Victor Li Tzar-kuoi - serves as a member of the national committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), according to his company website.  The CPPCC is China's top political advisory body comprising of thousands of members and is part of the “United Front System” which works to aid government influence domestically and abroad. Its members usually include top corporate figures. BBC Verify approached CK Hutchison Holdings for comment.  While Trump’s attention has focused on Balboa and Cristóbal, Chinese companies have been involved in projects elsewhere around the canal - with one major bridge project attracting some attention.  Three bridges currently cross the canal at various points. Slightly north of the Bridge of the Americas, a Chinese corporation is building the new Fourth Bridge, connecting Panama City to West Panama. This is the site in March 2024. The deal - which the Reuters news agency reported was worth about $1.42bn - has been beset by delays. But satellite images over the past year show development of the bridge has picked up, as seen here in January 2025. US officials have raised concerns over the involvement of Chinese firms in the project. Republican Senator Ted Cruz recently said that the “partially-completed bridge gives China the ability to block the canal without warning”, but did not elaborate as to how he thought the bridge could be used as an obstacle. Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama at the time, visits the site of the Fourth Bridge Project in 2019 Other major projects include the Amador Cruise Terminal built by the China Harbour Engineering Company on the Pacific side of the canal.  And an extension to the Panama City Metro which will run under the south end of the canal is being built by the China Railway Tunnel Group Company.  But while these projects represent some Chinese interests around the canal, Panamanian authorities have shelved several other high profile Chinese-led projects.  Eddie Tapiero, a Panama-based economist, said he believed that around 50% of projects initiated after Panama joined the BRI have been discontinued or suspended. In 2022, a major project intended to develop a new port on Isla Margarita on the Caribbean side of the canal was cancelled. A proposed high-speed rail line across the country from Panama City to David in the west of the country was also shelved after a new government came to power in Panama. And a plan to build a new Chinese embassy on the Amador Causeway Islands - which sit at the gates of the canal - was cancelled in 2018.  Experts who spoke to the BBC have suggested that China’s influence over infrastructure had mainly expanded to fill a gap left by the US in the region.  Mr Tapiero told BBC Verify that US companies were frequently uninterested or uncompetitive in bidding processes compared to Chinese competitors - who he said were often willing to offer finance when seeking deals.  Statistics for foreign direct investment (FDI) - the amount of money countries are investing in another country - paint a similar picture.  China invested $1.4bn in Panama in 2023 - a fourfold increase since the start of the BRI in 2017 - while US investments, although far higher overall, have declined over that same period. Annual investment in Panama From October 2023 to September 2024, shipping to or from China accounted for 21% of the cargo going through the waterway according to figures from the Panama Canal management company. However, the US remains the biggest investor in Panama and the top user of the canal by some distance. Last year, three and half times as much cargo passed through the canal going to and from the US than China. Cargo via the Panama Canal, top 15 countries, Oct 2023 to Sep 2024 Beijing’s influence in Panama may well be on the decline, says Henry Ziemer of the CSIS. The Panamanian authorities have “had a taste of what infrastructure partnership with China looks like, and they are not too pleased with that. It hasn’t delivered the big flashy gains that were promised when they first signed onto the BRI.” “That is why - along with pressure from Washington - the sense is now that Panama is seeking to move away from China.”",Mapping China’s influence around the Panama Canal  - BBC News,"Matt Murphy, Jake Horton and Erwan Rivault",BBC News,2025-02-24T05:05:19,2025-02-24T05:05:19,gemini-2.0-flash

Ramping up his desire for a more muscular Europe, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s nearly three-year fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion has proved that a foundation exists for the creation of a European army — an idea long discussed among some leaders on the continent. “I really believe that time has come,” he said. “The armed forces of Europe must be created.” It’s unclear whether the idea will catch on with European leaders. Zelenskyy has sought greater military and economic support from the European Union for years and repeatedly warned that other parts of Europe could be vulnerable to Russia’s expansionist ambitions. While the bloc — along with the United States — has been one of Kyiv’s strongest backers, pockets of political disagreement over its approach to Moscow and economic realities, including national debt levels that have crimped defense spending, have stood in the way of greater support. Zelenskyy also told The Associated Press on Saturday that he “didn’t let” his ministers sign an agreement with the U.S. on the extraction of minerals in the country, because “it is not ready to protect us, our interest.” Ukraine is hoping to offer rare earth elements essential for many kinds of technology in exchange for continued military aid. Earlier, Zelenskyy alluded to a phone conversation between Trump and Putin this week, after which Trump said that he and Putin would likely meet soon to negotiate a peace deal over Ukraine — breaking with the Biden administration’s harder line against Moscow over Russia’s all-out assault on Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Russia’s Foreign Ministry and the U.S. State Department said Saturday that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken by phone. Rubio reaffirmed Trump’s “commitment to finding an end to the conflict in Ukraine. In addition, they discussed the opportunity to potentially work together on a number of other bilateral issues,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. Trump previously assured Zelenskyy that he would have a seat at the table to end the war, and the Ukrainian leader insisted that Europe should also have one. “Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement, and the same rule should apply to all of Europe,” Zelenskyy said, adding that “not once did (Trump) mention that America needs Europe at the table.” “That says a lot,” he said. “The old days are over when America supported Europe just because it always had.” Europeans likely excluded from Ukraine peace talks European leaders have been trying to make sense of a tough new line from Washington on issues including democracy and Ukraine’s future, as the Trump administration continues to upend trans-Atlantic conventions that have been in place since after World War II. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, all but cut Europeans out of any Ukraine-Russia talks, despite Zelenskyy’s call for Europe to take part. “You can have the Ukrainians, the Russians, and clearly the Americans at the table talking,” Kellogg said at an event hosted by a Ukrainian tycoon. Pressed on whether that meant Europeans won’t be included, he said: “I’m a school of realism. I think that’s not going to happen.” “We need to ensure Ukrainian sovereignty,” he said, before adding: The “European alliance ... are going to be critical to this.” At the conference, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister, described the new U.S. stance as a “moment of truth” that requires European leaders to overcome their differences and unite for a meaningful peace in Ukraine. “This is an existential moment. It’s a moment where Europe has to stand up,” she said. “There won’t be any lasting peace, if it’s not a European-agreed peace.” Iceland’s prime minister, Kristrún Frostadóttir, lamented a lack of clarity from Washington. “People are still not sure what the U.S. wants to do. And I think it would be good if we came out of this conference if they had a clear picture of it,” she said.  German chancellor hits back at Vance Earlier, Scholz said that he was “pleased” at what he called a shared commitment with the United States to “preserving the sovereign independence of Ukraine” and agreed with Trump that the Russia-Ukraine war must end. But Scholz also condemned the new political tack from Washington, affirming his strong stance against the far-right and said his country won’t accept people who “intervene in our democracy.” A day earlier, Vance chastised Europe’s leaders at the conference and suggested that free speech is “in retreat” across the continent. Vance said that no democracy could survive telling millions of voters that their concerns “are invalid or unworthy of even being considered.” He also met with the co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party, which is polling second ahead of Scholz’s own Social Democrats before the Feb. 23 election in Germany. Alluding to Germany’s Nazi past, Scholz said that the longstanding commitment to “Never Again” — a return to the extreme right — wasn’t reconcilable with support for AfD. “We will not accept that people who look at Germany from the outside intervene in our democracy and our elections and in the democratic opinion-forming process in the interest of this party,” he said. “That’s just not done, certainly not amongst friends and allies. We resolutely reject this.” Not all responses from European leaders were negative. President Karin Keller-Sutter of Switzerland, which isn’t an EU member, was quoted by Swiss daily Le Temps as saying Vance had spoken about “values to defend and that we share, like freedom and the possibility for people to express themselves.” ___ Susie Blann reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Jamey Keaten reported from Lyon, France.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/these-are-the-14-hostages-yet-to-be-released-in-phase-one-of-the-gaza-ceasefire/,"With six rounds of hostage-prisoner releases completed in the ongoing Gaza ceasefire deal as of Saturday, there are 14 Israeli hostages still supposed to be set free in the first phase. Days into the truce, which began in January, family members of several hostages slated to be released from Gaza in the coming weeks expressed dread over their loved ones’ fates after Hamas conveyed information saying that eight of the 33 hostages on the original list are dead. Following the release of the information, those families were informed by the military that Hamas’s information aligned with previous assessments and there were dire concerns about their fates. Those on the list, to be returned over the initial period of 42 days that began on January 19, are so-called humanitarian cases: women, children, elderly individuals and the infirm. According to the terms of the ceasefire, the identities of those set to return are to be provided by the terror group 24 hours before each release, though in recent weeks, Hamas has not always met the deadline. As of Saturday, February 15, 70 of the 251 hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 34 confirmed dead by the IDF. The list of hostages left on the list to be released in phase one of the deal includesShiri Silberman Bibas, 33, and her two young sons,Ariel, 5, andKfir, 2.Israel is said to bepressuringmediators to clarify the condition of Bibas and her young sons. Hamas claimed in November 2023 that the three had been killed, which Israel called a “cruel” claim that it could not confirm. Israel has said there is “grave concern” over the fate of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir. The list of remaining hostages to be released in the first stage also includes five older men: Itzik Elgarat, 70Shlomo Mantzur, 86Ohad Yahalomi, 50Oded Lifshitz, 84Tsahi Idan, 50 And another six men under 50: Hisham al-Sayed, 36Omer Wenkert, 23Eliya Cohen, 27Avera Mengistu, 38Tal Shoham, 39Omer Shem-Tov, 22 Al-Sayed and Mengistu have been captive in Gaza for over a decade, after entering the Strip of their own accord. All the others were abducted on October 7, 2023. Hamas has so far released 24 hostages — 19 Israeli civilians and female soldiers, and five Thai nationals — during the ceasefire that began on January 19. The terror group also freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that. In total, Israel has said it will release up to 1,904 Palestinian prisoners — including 737 jailed Palestinians who were not captured in Gaza during the war and some of whom are serving life terms for dozens of murders — in return for the 33 Israeli hostages during the deal’s first phase. The deal’s implementation has been shaky, with Israel and Hamas both accusing each other of violating it at multiple junctures. US President Donald Trump’s controversial proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza fueled further uncertainty on whether the multiphase agreement will hold up. The 19 Israeli hostages who have been released in exchange for Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners and detainees in the deal so far, in six batches, are: Romi Gonen, 23Emily Damari, 27Doron Steinbrecher, 31Liri Albag, 19Karina Ariev, 20Danielle Gilboa, 20Naama Levy, 20Agam Berger, 21Arbel Yehoud, 29Gadi Moshe Mozes, 80Keith Siegel, 65Yarden Bibas, 35Ofer Calderon, 54Or Levy, 34Ohad Ben-Ami, 58Eli Sharabi, 52Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36Iair Horn, 46Sasha Troufanov, 28 The three-phase deal’s later phases are to see negotiations with the stated goal of reaching a “sustainable calm” in the enclave, alongside the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, the release of more Palestinian security prisoners, and an Israeli withdrawal from the Strip. Though talks for the second phase were supposed to commence two weeks ago, the negotiating team that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu initiallysent to Dohareportedly only had a mandate to discuss technical issues about the ongoing initial stage. The families of male hostages who are not set to be released until after the first phase of the deal have expressed deep concern over the delay in talks on the second phase. The war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, when some 3,000 Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and taking 251 hostages, amid many acts of brutality and sexual assault. Aside from hostages released under deals with the Palestinian terror group, eight have been rescued alive by troops, and the bodies of 40 hostages have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors. Hamas is also holding Mengistu and Al-Sayed — the two Israeli civilians who entered the Strip in 2014 and 2015 — as well as the body of an IDF soldier, Hadar Goldin, who was killed in 2014. The body of another IDF soldier, Oren Shaul, also killed in 2014, was recovered from Gaza in January.",These are the 14 hostages yet to be released in phase one of the Gaza ceasefire,"ToI Staff, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-02-15T11:36:42,2025-02-18T14:17:27,gemini-2.0-flash

IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi saidon the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that Tehran is increasing its monthly production of 60 percent enriched uranium by almost sevenfold. ""Iran will have about 250 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent by the time the IAEAâ	ms next report is presented in the coming weeks,"" Grossi said on February 14 in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the conference. ""It's clearly a sign that should be taken very seriously. So this is why I believe that we shouldn't be wasting more time. I hope that we can refocus on Iran,"" he said. Earlier this month he called on the Trump administration and Iran to engage in dialogue to advance the nuclear talks, stressing that dialogue is ""absolutely necessary"" to make progress. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said last week that talks with the United States were ""not smart, wise or honorable"" after President Donald Trump restored his ""maximum pressure"" policy toward Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero to push it into a deal that would severely constrain its nuclear program.

https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-cuban-fighters-ukraine-mercenaries/33315782.html,"In a room far behind the front lines in central Ukraine, a Cuban man wearing Russian military fatigues smiles widely as he taps out a rhythm on a table. But his mood soon turns somber. Frank Dario Jarrosay Manfuga, 36, joined Russia's army in January 2024.By March he had been captured by Ukrainian forces, and he is now hoping for a way out of a desperate situation.""I never intended to kill anyone. I never wanted to participate in a war. I have a family,"" said Manfuga, who claimed he was tricked into boarding a Russia-bound plane with the promise of a job in construction.""Maybe some organization could save me,"" he said, adding he has no desire to return to Russia or Cuba.Manfuga's claim that he was duped could not be verified. A former geography teacher who later became a professional musician to increase his income, he is now a captured mercenary.Hisinterview with Schemes, the investigative unit of RFE's Ukrainian Service, was arranged through contacts in the Ukrainian military, which is keen to demonstrate just how widely Russia has cast its net in a search for foreign manpower to bolster the invasion and offset an unpopular conscription drive at home. In Manfuga's case, that distance is more than 9,500 kilometers from Moscow. And he is not alone.""Based on passports obtained by Ukrainian hackers, our own information from Cuba, numerous videos we've seen, and reports of some Cubans killed in combat, we can estimate that around 5,000 Cuban soldiers are fighting for Russia,"" Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, co-founder of the Cuban Democratic Directorate, a U.S.-based NGO advocating for democratic change in communist Cuba, told Schemes. ""This network could not function without the Cuban regime's approval."" If that figure is accurate, it would amount to under half the number of soldiers from North Korea reportedly participating in Russia's war with their government's open backing -- most notably in the effort to counter Ukraine's shock offensive in Russia's Kursk region.But unlike North Koreans, Cuban fighters in Russia have left a significant social media footprint, with many openly embracing the Kremlin's militarism and ideology, a Schemes investigation found.Those posts helped Schemes identify hundreds of mercenaries, find previously unreported training facilities with the aid of satellite imagery, and discover the location and the nature of some of the Cubans' military activities in Russia and on Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory.They also raise questions about how hard Cuba's pro-Russian government is ""working to neutralize and dismantle a human trafficking network,"" as its Foreign Ministry claimed in September 2023, when evidence of Cubans fighting in the war was beginning to emerge. Dead In The Battle For BakhmutImportant indications of the scale of Cubans' involvement in the war came just days after the Cuban Foreign Ministry's statement, when a document hack unearthed nearly 200 Cubans serving in the Russian military, initially posted to the Tula region south of Moscow.That trove was first discovered by the Ukraine-focused investigative group InformNapalm, with the documents proving the Cubans' service coming from the e-mail account of a Russian major hacked by Cyber Resistance, a Ukrainian hacker group.Since then, RFE journalists have found new evidence of hundreds of other apparent Cuban mercenaries on the Russian social network VKontakte.In many cases, their accounts were created in 2024 -- seemingly the year they arrived in Russia for pre-deployment training. The Schemes investigation tied many of the Cuban mercenaries with an online presence to the 106th Airborne Division. In one example, a photo posted in July 2023 by a man named Aliesky Anache included the geotag Promyshlenny Proyezd, an area of the city of Tula known to host the 106th Airborne Division and its 51st Parachute Regiment.Journalists were subsequently able to geolocate the blue-walled military building where that photo was taken. Satellite imagery of the region suggests there is no other military unit stationed anywhere in the surrounding area.Units of the 106th Airborne Division participated in the battle for Bakhmut. Known grimly as ""the meat grinder,"" the monthslong battle concluded with the Russian occupation of the city in May 2023 and was the one of the bloodiest chapters of the war to date.And at least one Cuban, a 41-year-old fighter with the call sign Chiki, appears to have died there before being buried in Moscow, according to a post on VKontakte found by RFE journalists. Another Cuban with the same call sign became a minor celebrity in Russia after appearing on the military TV channel Zvezda.In a segment of a Zvezda program on August 2, 2024, the fighter, whose real name is Rafael, was seen scrawling ""Hasta la vista, baby"" (""Goodbye, baby"" in Spanish) on military projectiles and informed the interviewer that he had ""fallen in love with buckwheat,"" a Russian staple, during his military service.Rafael's VKontakte profile features photos of him wearing patches associated with Russia's Wagner Group.From August on, Rafael posted several images from combat positions in Ukraine's Kherson region. But many of his social media posts before then featured photos with other Cubans during training exercises and outings to bars in Tula. The bar photos and the fighters that featured in them helped RFE journalists geolocate a second military facility used by the Cubans of the 106th. This previously unpublicized facility in the Tula region is the paratrooper training ground, unofficially called Krym (Crimea) in VKontakte geotags.Rush For Rubles, Assist For RussiaGrueling poverty in Cuba helps explain the appeal of Russian military service to Cubans. Historically friendly ties with Moscow dating back to Soviet times mean that citizens of the island nation can enter the country as tourists without a visa.A typical monthly salary for a foreigner enlisting in the Russian army on a yearlong contract is the equivalent of $2,000.That was seemingly enough for Odin Rivas, who featured in one of Rafael's posts from Tula, to swap running a small business in Cuba for active military duty. Rivas has been posting frequently from military positions, promoting Russian and Soviet propaganda symbols.Back in 2022, he was being celebrated as a hero in the Cuban press after he volunteered as a firefighter to help extinguish a giant fire at the Matanzas oil terminal.Matanzas is at the heart of Moscow's patronly ties to Cuba, since it receives large oil deliveries from Russian tankers. Using the ship-tracking service Marine Traffic and satellite images from Planet Labs, RFE journalists found satellite images showing that Russian oil tankers had docked in Cuban ports in 2022, 2023, and 2024.According to data obtained by Schemes from the KSE Institute and Kpler, in 2024, tankers transported more than 1.8 million barrels of Russian oil products to Cuba. From the beginning of 2025, they carried more than 700,000 barrels to the Caribbean island.One of those deliveries came at a vital time as Cuba witnessed its worst protests in several years in March 2024 amid energy and food shortages.Havana has never formally endorsed Russia's invasion.But on March 1, a day when Russia targeted civilian infrastructure and killed hundreds of civilians in cities across Ukraine, its Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Pedro Luis Pedroso Cuesta, criticized the West for ""assuming that Russia would remain defenseless in the face of direct threats to its national security.""And in May 2024, Russian state media reported Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel had wished Russian President Vladimir Putin success in ""the special military operation,"" as the Kremlin calls the war, during talks in Moscow that coincided with Russia's May 9 military parade commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.In comments to Schemes, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said Cuba ""has clearly chosen Russia's side in the full-scale war because of its anti-American stance.""In addition to extensive open-source research, Schemes journalists obtained copies of Russian military documents from Ukrainian military sources concerning other Cubans who are serving in Russian military units. One of the documents was a questionnaire belonging to Julio Pelaez, a 38-year-old man who last September appealed in Russian on VKontakte for help getting a plane ticket to Moscow in order to report to ""any recruitment center.""In the questionnaire, Pelaez, who said he had never been abroad before, appeared to lean into a Kremlin propaganda trope concerning Ukraine when stating his motivation to join the war. ""I consider it the duty of every free person who hates Nazis,"" Pelaez wrote.By the end of October, according to his profile page, Pelaez was in Russia, and had posted a photo of his military gear complete with the pro-war ""Z"" symbol, a patch featuring the Cuban flag, and a document resembling a Russian passport","Russia Turns To Cuban Recruits As It Struggles With Conscription, RFE/RL Reveals","Valeriya Yegoshyna, Olya Ivleva, Kyrylo Ovsyaniy, Kira Tolstyakova, Schemes",RFE/RL,2025-02-19T11:14:50,2025-02-19T11:14:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czep44jn9jyo,"The UK military is ""so run down"" it could not lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, the former head of the Army has said. Lord Dannatt told the BBC that up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed for such a mission and ""we just haven't got that number available"". It comes after Sir Keir Starmer said the UK would ""play its part"" in guaranteeing Ukraine's security after the prime minister was asked this week if he was open to sending British troops as peacekeepers. A former Nato chief told the BBC that Britain and France should lead a force of up to 100,000 troops as part of a long-term peacekeeping effort should Russia's war with Ukraine end. US President Donald Trump earlier this week announced he had had a lengthy conversation with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations to stop the ""ridiculous war"" in Ukraine would begin ""immediately"". Trump then ""informed"" Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, of his plan. Lord Dannatt - who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2009 - agreed that a force to keep the peace would require about 100,000 troops. However he said the UK would have to supply ""quite a proportion of that and we really couldn't do it"". ""Our military is so run down at the present moment, numerically and as far as capability and equipment is concerned, it would potentially be quite embarrassing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster. ""I mean, if we were to deploy 10,000 troops, each rotation for six months, that would effectively tie up 30,000 or 40,000 troops and we just haven't got that number available. ""So there are some big issues here that today's politicians won't really have considered."" It comes as Britain's foreign and defence secretaries called on the UK and Europe to ""do more"" to ""share the burden"" of regional security in a joint article for the Daily Telegraph on Saturday. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said he was ""very encouraged"" by his talks on Ukraine with US Vice-President JD Vance on Friday, on the first day of the Munich Security Conference. ""We share the view that there has to be an enduring peace,"" Lammy told Reuters news agency following the meeting. ""There was an agreement that Zelensky and the Ukrainians have to be part of that negotiated deal."" The talks came after Vance gave a speech at the conference, in which he was expected to address possible talks to end the war but instead attacked European democracies. In the address, he said the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but ""from within"". He added that Europe must ""step up in a big way to provide for its own defence"" and said he hoped a ""reasonable settlement"" could be reached for the war. Lammy and his defence colleague John Healey said that Putin had for two decades sought ""to recreate the Russian empire and suffocate the countries around its borders"". ""Too often in the past, the West has let him,"" they said in the Telegraph. ""We did too little in 2008 when he invaded Georgia, and in 2014 when he first went into Ukraine."" Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who was Nato secretary-general from 2009 to 2014, said ""a number of European countries need to step up to the plate"" for any peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, adding that the UK and France should lead that coalition by putting boots on the ground. ""I would let military experts determine [the number] but my guess would be between 50,000 and 100,000 troops,"" he told BBC Newsnight. As of October 2024, there were 74,612 members of the UK's regular Army forces (excluding Gurkhas and volunteers), according to the latestMinistry of Defence (MoD) figures. The Army has targets on how many new recruits below the rank of officer it should take on every year, set out by the MoD. These targets have been missed in almost every single financial year since 2010-11, according to a written answer to Parliament last January. Lord Dannatt said the Labour government would need to ""look at their priorities"", adding: ""Yes, health, education, roads, infrastructure are important, but actually defence and the security of this nation are more important."" The crossbench peer said he believes the UK government needs to go further than its commitment of increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP - a pledge that they have yet to put a timeline on when it will be delivered. Zelensky has previously asked for the UK and other European allies including France to send troops to Ukraine for a peacekeeping operation after the war. Sir Keir last month signed a ""landmark"" 100-year pact with Ukraine, building on the Â£12.8bn the UK has already sent to the country, with further commitments of Â£3bn every year for ""as long as it takes"". The UK will also continue to train Ukrainian troops, 50,000 of whom have been trained on British soil so far. In response to Lord Dannatt's comments, an MoD spokesperson said Britain's armed forces were ""respected worldwide for their professionalism and excellence"". ""Right now, the Ukrainians are still fighting with huge courage. Our government is stepping up support for Ukraine's war fighters to put them in the best possible position for any talks. The spokesperson cited a Â£150m ""firepower package"" announced this week ""providing more drones, tanks and air defence systems"". Some of the men who were there look back nearly 80 years to the largest single airborne operation. The deal sets up an investment fund to search for minerals, and set outs how revenues would be split. The White House has been pushing for the agreement as a prerequisite for further military assistance. A minister says nearly all key details have been finalised for a deal giving the US access to the country's minerals.

The stage features Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad flags, as well as propaganda posters, including a picture of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar looking at the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem with the caption in English, Hebrew and Arabic, saying “No migration except to Jerusalem,” a dig at US President Donald Trump’s call to resettle Gazans. Another poster has aerial images of the communities and bases that Hamas invaded on October 7, 2023, with the caption, “We crossed over swiftly.” In the coming hours, hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Sasha Troufanov and Iair Horn are expected to be released from captivity. Dekel-Chen and Horn are being held by Hamas, while Troufanov is being held by Islamic Jihad. Ù

The C-17 US military aircraft will carry 67 persons from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, three Uttar Pradesh natives, two each from Rajasthan, Goa, and Maharashtra, and one each native of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Saturday's flight is expected to arrive at the Amristar airport around 10 pm. The deportations will continue every other week till all the illegal immigrants are not sent back to their respective homeland, a news agency PTI report said. Last week, 104 illegal Indian migrants were deported from the US. They were sent in a US military C-17 transport aircraft to Amritsar. The deportations also come in the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the US, where he met Trump to discuss several key bilateral issues, including immigration. Addressing a joint press conference, PM Modi affirmed that New Delhi is ready to take back its citizens living illegally in America. He said most of those staying in the US illegally come from ordinary families, often misguided by human traffickers. ""They are shown big dreams and most of them are such who are misled and brought here. So, we should attack this entire system of human trafficking. Together, it should be the effort of the US and India to destroy such an ecosystem from its roots so that human trafficking ends... Our bigger fight is against that entire ecosystem, and we are confident that President Trump will fully cooperate with India in finishing this ecosystem,"" the prime minister said at the presser. However, it is notable that the treatment given to the deported Indians did not sit well, sparking a massive controversy among people and the political circuit alike. Opposition leaders came down heavily on the Centre, asking it to take a stand against the unfair treatment given to the deportees. The handcuffing and shackling of deportees has been justified by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as a standard security protocol used on deportation flights to prevent escape attempts or disruptions. However, many have argued that such a practice is excessive and inhuman, especially for people who have committed no crimes beyond immigration violations. External affairs minister S Jaishankar addressed the matter in the Parliament and asserted that India is engaging with US officials to ensure that the deportees are given dignified treatment. He further emphasised that while immigration laws must be upheld, humane treatment should be not a compromise. The Trump administration has brought down a wreck in the lives of thousands of Indians, placing immense pressure on the central government to manage the reintegration efforts. As the immigration laws in the US are being tightened, India will also have to find ways to curb illegal migration with the help of stronger border management and diplomatic negotiations.",Second US flight with Indian migrants to arrive in Punjab's Amritsar today,HT News Desk,Hindustan Times,2025-02-15T09:09:53,2025-02-15T14:10:33,gemini-2.0-flash

The 10th formal hearing will be held at 2 p.m. Thursday, with Han, Hong Jang-won, former first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service, and Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the National Police Agency, chosen for witness examinations. The announcement comes a day after the court said the trial's ninth hearing will take place Tuesday. The court had previously rejected a request from Yoon's lawyers to call Han as a witness, citing the lack of necessity. But the lawyers requested Han's presence again, saying he best understood the reasons behind the Dec. 3 martial law imposition. Hong had testified at the court earlier this month, but Yoon's lawyers requested he appear again, raising doubt over his testimony. Cho, who is suffering from blood cancer, had also previously been selected as a witness but failed to appear twice, citing health reasons. If he fails to appear again, the court could consider forcefully bringing him in. He is considered to be a key witness in the trial due to his alleged involvement in martial law operations. The court is expected to decide whether to schedule more hearings based on the trial's proceedings. If it does not select additional witnesses, the court could conclude oral arguments in the last week of February, and a final decision on whether to uphold Yoon's impeachment or reinstate him is likely to be reached in early or mid-March. Meanwhile, Thursday's impeachment hearing will coincide with the first preparatory hearing of Yoon's criminal trial on charges related to his martial law imposition. The criminal hearing is scheduled to take place in the morning. Yoon's legal team requested the Constitutional Court to change the date for the 10th formal hearing to a different date.

Cho made the remarks as he arrived at Munich International Airport to attend an annual international security forum in Munich, where he is set to have his first in-person meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday (local time). The planned talks come as President Donald Trump announced a plan to impose 25-percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, starting March 12, and is pushing to roll out ""reciprocal"" tariffs on U.S. imports to match what other countries impose on American goods. Trump has also been weighing tariffs on cars, chips and pharmaceuticals. ""I have this thought that (I) will have discussions on ways for strategic cooperation in the shipbuilding industry, atomic energy and cutting-edge technology sectors, including semiconductor and artificial intelligence; explain our thoughts and position on 25-percent tariffs on steel and aluminum and the issue of reciprocal tariffs; and express our will to resolve it through dialogue and explore a solution,"" he told reporters. ""In terms of specifics, there might not be much time to go as far as to touch on solutions, but I will convey our position and thought in what could be a spadework (in pursuit of a solution),"" he added. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul arrives at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, on Feb. 14, 2025 to depart for Germany, where he is set to attend the Munich Security Conference. (Yonhap) Cho underscored the need to take into account Trump's perceived transactional approach on foreign policy issues as Seoul seeks to enhance its national interests in diplomacy with the Trump administration. ""After all, to find a win-win solution, we need to appeal to the U.S. by underscoring how important South Korea's role is for the alliance and how it can contribute to the effort to achieve (Trump's) vision to make America great again,"" he said. The minister noted that during his call with the secretary on Jan. 23, he confirmed the shared consensus on the ""firm"" alliance, cooperation on North Korean issues and the importance of trilateral cooperation among South Korea, the U.S. and Japan.

Aroldo Lázaro Sáenz was injured on Friday after a convoy taking peacekeepers to Beirut airport was ""violently attacked,"" UNIFIL said. Hezbollah supporters attacked the convoy of Lázaro as it tried to make its way to Rafik Hariri International Airport. Lebanese forces fired tear gas to break up a protest organized by Hezbollah supporters near Beirut airport on Saturday, Reuters reported, citing Lebanese Security sources. Protestors claimed their goal was to secure the return of citizens stranded in Iran and block external influences on the Lebanese government, Hezbollah-owned Al Manar reported. UNIFIL demanded a full and immediate investigation by Lebanese authorities and for all perpetrators to be brought to justice, it added in a statement. At least one UNIFIL officer was injured in the incident after Hezbollah operatives attacked the vehicle marked with the UN logo, beating the people inside. The Lebanese LBCI network reported that four UNIFIL personnel were attacked. Three fled to the airport, and the fourth was taken to a military hospital. The attackers used iron rods, set fire to at least one vehicle, and shouted ""Shiite, Shiite"" during the attack, Lebanese media reported. Social media footage showed protestors waving Hezbollah flags, blocking the road and setting fires on it. The Lebanese Army warned Lebanese citizens from participating in the riots, saying it created dangerous internal tension during a critical period for the country. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam condemned the attack and expressed support for UNIFIL. Ø¥Ø·Ù

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-pledges-immediate-response-to-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs/,"The line from Brussels appears to have hardened since its response to Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs earlier this week. The EU has pledged to respond “firmly and immediately” to Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs on all US imports, in a sign that Brussels’ negotiating stance with the new US administration may be hardening. In a statement published on Friday morning, the EU's executive denounced Trump’s decision to match the tariff rate other countries charge on US goods as “a step in the wrong direction” and reiterated its commitment to an “open and predictable global trading system”. “The EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade, including when tariffs are used to challenge legal and non-discriminatory policies,” the Commission said. The language noticeably differs from Brussels’ response to Trump’s announcement of 25% duties on steel and aluminium earlier this week, when it vowed a “firm and proportionate” response. The word “proportionate” was entirely absent from Friday’s statement. But the word was used by European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis – who told Bloomberg TV on Friday morning that Brussels’ is committed to a “firm and proportionate” response. “We do not see the basis for these tariffs, neither economically nor legally,” he said, adding that the Berlaymont is “in engagement” with US officials to “find a constructive way forward”. The Commission's comments follow Trump’s announcement on Thursday night that Washington will impose “reciprocal” levies to address cases of “unfair” economic protectionism by other nations. The duties could enter into force as early as April 2, according to the White House. The EU’s average tariff rate is higher than the US's in many critical export-dependent sectors, including cars, chemicals and food. However, the bloc’s overall average tariff rate is slightly below the US's average of 3.95%, according to economists at ING. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump repeatedly denounced the EU’s trade policy vis-à-vis the US. ""We all love Europe, love the countries in Europe, but the European Union has been absolutely brutal on trade,"" he said. The EU ran a surplus in goods of €150 billion and a deficit in services of roughly €100 billion with the US in 2023, according to the EU. The 25% duties on steel and aluminium are set to enter into force on 12 March. However, Trump has repeatedly said that countries could avoid the duties by lowering trade barriers or shifting production to the US. Trump has also introduced an additional 10% levy on all imports from China and threatened to impose 25% duties on Mexico and Canada since his return to the White House last month.

He was there “for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue in a hospital setting treatment for bronchitis that is still ongoing,” the Vatican said. They later confirmed he was in the facility, and that he had canceled his meetings for the next three days. Francis has made a number of visits to the hospital in recent years, and received abdominal surgery in 2023. He has been struggling with bronchitis in recent weeks and has asked aides to read speeches and addresses. But he held audiences at the Vatican on Friday morning before his hospitalization, including with the prime minister of Slovakia and with Mark Thompson, the Chief Executive of CNN. Christopher Lamb, CNN’s Vatican Correspondent, who saw Francis at the beginning of that meeting, said the pope was mentally alert but struggling to speak for extended periods due to breathing difficulties. The latest diagnosis of bronchitis will cause particular worries for the Roman Catholic Church, because Francis has suffered from lung-related issues for much of his life. As a young man, the Argentinian leader suffered from severe pneumonia and had part of one lung removed. Francis became pope in 2013, the first pontiff from South America. More recently he has been seen with a walking stick and sometimes uses a wheelchair. Last month, he suffered a fall and injured his arm. Francis also suffers from diverticulitis, a common condition that can cause the inflammation or infection of the colon. In 2021, he had surgery to remove part of his colon. Despite his medical issues Francis has kept up a busy calendar of events, including a 12-day visit of four countries in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. That trip was one of the longest any pope has embarked on and marked the furthest geographical distance (about 20,000 miles) that Francis has traveled since being chosen as the leader of the Catholic Church. Last week, it was announced that the pope would meet King Charles III in April. Christopher Lamb reported from the Vatican, and Antonia Mortensen reported from Rome.

The MOU paves the way for a new round of cooperation between Taiwan and the Czech group — People in Need — in a joint effort to assist Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic, the ministry said on Wednesday. Through the joint project, the Czech group would provide shelter for young Ukrainians fleeing the ongoing war at home and offer counseling services to refugees in the Czech Republic, ministry said. Photo: Huang Chin-hsuen, Taipei Times With a budget of US$283,252, the project, which is to run until the end of this year, is expected to help 4,825 displaced Ukrainians, the ministry told the Central News Agency, without specifying if the government would be the source of the funding. Taiwan in 2022 donated US$1 million to People in Need to support its programs aiding the education and integration of displaced Ukrainian children in Czech schools, along with other assistance. The US$1 million in funding was part of the US$32 million that the ministry raised from private citizens in Taiwan shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The MOU was signed between Representative to the Czech Republic Ke Liang-ruey (柯良叡) and People in Need executive director Simon Panek. The deal was lauded by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois Wu (吳志中), who took part in the signing ceremony remotely from Taipei, as another “milestone” for Taiwan-Czechia collaborations in their help for Ukraine, the ministry said in a news release. Panek was cited in the release as expressing gratitude for Taiwan’s aid to Ukraine, citing how countless Ukrainian refugees had benefited from Taiwan’s support. The ministry in its release also reaffirmed Taiwan’s commitment to supporting Ukraine as the war continues and to keep working with the Czech Republic to provide humanitarian assistance to Ukrainian refugees. Czech Commissioner for Human Rights Klara Simackova Laurencikova also took part in the signing ceremony in Prague, the release said. Founded in 1992, People in Need has grown to become the largest humanitarian organization in the Czech Republic and one of the most important non-governmental organizations in central and eastern Europe, the ministry said. Taiwan would benefit from more integrated military strategies and deployments if the US and its allies treat the East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea as a “single theater of operations,” a Taiwanese military expert said yesterday.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2025/02/14/2003831873,"An alleged US government plan to encourage Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) to form a joint venture with Intel to boost US chipmaking would place the Taiwanese foundry giant in a more disadvantageous position than proposed tariffs on imported chips, a semiconductor expert said yesterday. If TSMC forms a joint venture with its US rival, it faces the risk of technology outflow, said Liu Pei-chen (å	8a	89ä½©ç	9c	9f), a researcher at the Taiwan Industry Economics Database of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. A report by international financial services firm Baird said that Asia semiconductor supply chain talks suggest that the US government would ask TSMC to send engineers to Intelâ	80	99s US fab, applying the companyâ	80	99s know-how to ensure both the fab and subsequent manufacturing projects are viable. Photo: CNA Although TSMC has built production facilities in Dresden, Germany, and Kumamoto, Japan, through joint ventures, the local businesses it partners with are its customers, Liu said. If a joint venture with Intel is formed, it would inevitably focus on advanced semiconductor technology and once technology leaks occur, that could jeopardize TSMCâ	80	99s leading edge in advanced technology, he said. As US President Donald Trump is committed to prioritizing US interests, if TSMC cooperates with Intel it might be placed at a disadvantage, he added. TSMCâ	80	99s leadership in advanced technology is irreplaceable and gives it strong bargaining power, Liu said, adding that if the US imposes tariffs on imported chips, the increased costs could be passed on to TSMCâ	80	99s customers in the US. Therefore, a joint venture with Intel is the worse choice for TSMC and more unfavorable than Trumpâ	80	99s tariff plans, he said. Intel is facing operational difficulties and is encountering bottlenecks in technological development, while TSMC is in a leading position. If a TSMC-Intel joint venture is formed, it would help Intel overcome difficulties and bolster the development of the US semiconductor manufacturing industry, Liu said. TSMC chairman C.C. Wei (é	ad	8få	93²å®¶) has said the company has no interest in acquiring Intelâ	80	99s chip manufacturing facilities after the US firm spun off its foundry business, he said.

https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-russia-us-kremlin-us-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-illusory-goal/,"Ukraine will participate in negotiations with Russia and the United States “one way or another,” but peace talks will remain primarily bilateral, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. “We, of course, understand that our main counterpart in this process is Washington,” Peskov said, according to Russian state media. “One way or another, of course, Ukraine will participate in the negotiations. Of course, there will be a bilateral Russian-American track of this dialogue, and a track that, of course, will be connected with Ukraine's involvement.” Peskov’s remarks came after a whirlwind 24 hours in which U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and declared that negotiations between the U.S. and Russia to end the war in Ukraine would commence imminently, notably sidelining Ukrainian participation in his public messaging. At the same time, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called a return to Ukraine’s old borders an “illusory goal.”
Later in the day, Trump declined to directly answer a reporter’s question about Ukraine’s role in the coming talks. “It’s an interesting question,” Trump replied, before suggesting that Ukraine chose to enter into a war with Russia after its invasion. “I think they have to make peace. That was not a good war to go into.” The Trump administration’s decision to downplay Ukraine’s role in negotiations with Russia — and to reopen communication channels with the Russian leader — rattled European leaders and prompted an outpouring of criticism for Trump’s methods.
“Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity are unconditional,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Wednesday night. “Our priority must now be strengthening Ukraine and providing robust security guarantees.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy put on a brave face after his conversation with Trump on Wednesday, saying the two leaders had a “meaningful conversation” about peace. But the Ukrainian leader was more forceful in his language on Thursday, saying he and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk had agreed on a call that “no negotiations with Putin can begin without a united position from Ukraine, Europe and the U.S.” “I also warned world leaders against trusting Putin’s claims of readiness to end the war,” Zelenskyy added.",Kremlin: Ukraine can be part of peace talks — but main players will be US and Russia,Giselle Ruhiyyih Ewing,POLITICO,2025-02-13T19:50:36,2025-02-13T19:50:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/02/13/why-are-we-handing-russia-what-it-wants-eus-chief-diplomat-blasts-us-over-ukraine-a87993,"BRUSSELS â










— The European Union’s top diplomat slammed U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration for sidelining Ukraine












and engaging with Russia’s Vladimir Putin without consulting Kyiv or Europe.



U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told allies in Brussels on Wednesday that Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO and reclaim its 1991 borders as part of a peace settlement were “unrealistic.” He also said the U.S. would “no longer tolerate” European NATO members relying on Washington for security.



The remarks, followed by a surprise phone call between Trump and Putin in which the two agreed to enter peace talks, have stunned European officials and raised concerns that Kyiv may be sidelined in discussions about its own future.



“They [the U.S.] say that it’s not going to be NATO membership, but some other security guarantees. Then the questions need to be answered by everybody — what are these security guarantees, really?” said Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, ahead of a NATO defense ministers’ meeting.



“Being in NATO, where we have these structures, is actually the best security guarantee,” she added.

















Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister known for her staunch support of Ukraine, condemned what she described as a reckless diplomatic maneuver that rewards Russian aggression before negotiations even begin.



“We shouldn’t take anything off the table before negotiations start. It plays into Russia’s hands. And it is exactly what they want,” she said. “Why are we giving them everything they want even before negotiations begin? Appeasement has never worked.”



German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius echoed her concerns, warning against making public concessions ahead of talks.



“In my view, it would have been better to discuss Ukraine’s possible NATO membership or the country’s possible loss of territory only at the negotiating table, not to rule it out beforehand,” Pistorius said in Brussels.



Kallas stressed that any peace deal imposed without the consent of Ukraine and European allies was doomed to fail.



“There’s an agreement being made behind our backs that simply will not work,” she said. “For any kind of agreement, you need Europeans to implement it, you need Ukrainians to implement it.”



“It doesn’t look good if somebody agrees on something and everybody else has to say, ‘OK, you have agreed, but we will not follow this.’ Ukrainians will resist, and we will support them,”





Kallas added.

















NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte took a more diplomatic tone, arguing that the statements from Trump and Hegseth merely underscored the need for dialogue within the alliance.



“Secretary Hegseth’s comments, and what later emerged from Washington, were significant statements,” Rutte said.



“At the same time, this is how an alliance should function,” he said. “We are a coalition of democracies. We need to debate. But I see a clear convergence: we all want peace, we want it to be lasting and we must ensure Ukraine is in the strongest possible position.”



At the same time, Rutte noted that Europe “must also step up defense spending and industrial production.”



“On that, there is clear agreement,” he said.",‘Why Are We Handing Russia What It Wants?’: EU’s Chief Diplomat Blasts U.S. Over Ukraine,Pyotr Kozlov,The Moscow Times,2025-02-13T08:29:51,2025-04-30T22:30:20,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vpqr6511yo,"Hamas has said it is committed to implementing the Gaza ceasefire deal with Israel and will continue releasing hostages as scheduled, raising hopes that a resumption of the war can be averted. Following talks in Cairo, the Palestinian armed group said mediators from Egypt and Qatar had confirmed they would ""remove obstacles"". Egyptian and Qatari reports also said gaps had been bridged. An Israeli government spokesman did not comment on the reports but stated that if Hamas did not free three living hostages on Saturday then the ceasefire would end. Israel's prime minister made a similar ultimatum on Tuesday after Hamas said it was postponing releases over what it claimed were Israeli violations. Hamas said these included a failure to allow in the agreed amounts of vital humanitarian aid, including tents and shelters, which Israel denied. The group's threat to derail the deal prompted US President Donald Trump to propose Israel cancel the agreement altogether and ""let hell break out"" unless ""all of the hostages"" were returned by Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he welcomed Trump's demand and warned: ""If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon [10:00 GMT], the ceasefire will end and the [Israeli military] will resume intense fighting until the final defeat of Hamas."" However, there were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether he was demanding the release of all 76 hostages still in Gaza - in line with Trump's ultimatum - or just the three due to be freed this weekend. On Wednesday, an Egyptian security source told the BBC that Egypt and Qatar were ""intensifying their diplomatic efforts in an attempt to salvage the ceasefire agreement"", as Hamas's leader for Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, arrived in Cairo to hold talks with Egypt's intelligence chief and other officials. After concluding the talks on Thursday morning, Hamas put out a statement saying they focused on the need for all terms of the deal to be fulfilled, particularly regarding deliveries of caravans, tents, heavy construction equipment, medical supplies and fuel. It added that the talks were ""positive"" and that the mediators had agreed to work to ""remove obstacles and close gaps"". ""Accordingly, Hamas reaffirms its commitment to implementing the agreement as signed, including the exchange of prisoners according to the specified timeline."" At the same time, Egyptian state-run Al Qahera TV reported that Egypt and Qatar had successfully ""overcome obstacles"" and that Israel and Hamas were committed to fully implementing the ceasefire deal. Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV also said the negotiations had been successful and that mobile homes and heavy machinery would be allowed into Gaza on Thursday. However, Israeli media then cited the Israeli prime minister's office as calling the Al Jazeera report ""fake news"" and saying there was ""no basis"" to it. Omer Dostri, a spokesman for the prime minister, later clarified the denial, writing on X: ""There is no entry of caravans or heavy equipment into the Gaza Strip, and there is no co-ordination for this."" When asked about Hamas's statement at a later media briefing, another Israeli government spokesman said Israel's position on the ceasefire agreement was ""crystal clear"". ""There is a framework in place for the release of our hostages,"" David Mencer said. ""That framework makes clear that three live hostages must be released by Hamas terrorists on Saturday."" ""If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages, by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end."" War-weary Palestinians in Gaza said they had been alarmed by the prospect of a return to fighting after 16 months of devastating war. ""When the truce was announced, we felt immense joy. However, with the announcement of a new crisis, fear returned [and] traders began raising commodity prices,"" Mouti al-Qedra told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme. ""I pray to God constantly for lasting peace, especially after the martyrdom of 65 members of the al-Qedra family. Now, we are relieved that the crisis has been resolved, hoping no more martyrs will fall."" The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza. So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal. The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named. Negotiations for the ceasefire's second phase - which should see the remaining 59 hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun. The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",Hamas says it will continue releasing Israeli hostages under Gaza deal,David Gritten,BBC News,2025-02-13T06:30:02,2025-02-13T12:28:43,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20g37rrjy1o,"Twelve people have been injured after a grenade was thrown into a busy bar in the French city of Grenoble, local authorities have said. The incident happened at the Aksehir bar shortly after 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday evening, leaving two people in critical condition. The motive for the attack is not clear but investigators say it ""may be linked to a settling of scores"". Prosecutor Francois Touret-de-Courcey said eyewitness accounts suggest the suspect, who is as yet unidentified, may also have been carrying a Kalashnikov assault rifle. Speaking to reporters at the scene, he said: ""There's nothing to make us think it's linked to terrorism,"" describing the incident as an ""act of extreme violence"". He added that investigators were looking at possible connections to drug trafficking. Authorities said many people were at the venue, located in the city's Olympic Village neighbourhood, when the suspect briefly entered. Some 80 firefighters and police officers were deployed to the scene with the area remaining cordoned off on Thursday morning, French paper Le Figaro reports. Deputy Mayor Chloe Pantel told the AFP news agency that the venue was ""a spot where locals and people from outside the neighbourhood gather, especially to watch football matches"". Police presence in the area will remain for a while, she added. Posting on X, Mayor Eric Piolle condemned what he described as a ""criminal act of extraordinary violence,"" before thanking rescue and security forces ""for their rapid intervention"".

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/13/honda-nissan-end-merger-talks-scuttling-60bn-deal,"The potential tie-up would have created the worldâ\x80\x99s third-largest automaker, rivaling US and Chinese companies. Japanâ\x80\x99s second and third-largest automakers, Honda and Nissan, have announced that their boards had voted to end talks to merge, even as they pledged to continue their cooperation on electric vehicles amid intensifying global competition. Thursdayâ\x80\x99s announcement brings to an end a potential tie-up that would have created the worldâ\x80\x99s third-largest automaker, worth some $60bn. The firms said in a joint statement that they â\x80\x9cagreed to terminate the MOU (memorandum of understanding) signed on December 23 last year for consideration of a business integration between the two companiesâ\x80\x9d. The firmsâ\x80\x99 intention to join forces had been seen as a bid to catch up with US titan Tesla andChinese firmsin the electric vehicle market. Nissan reportedly backed out of the talks with larger rival Honda after negotiations were complicated by growing differences, including Hondaâ\x80\x99s proposal that Nissan become a subsidiary, sources had previously told the Reuters news agency. In the joint statement, the automakers confirmed Honda â\x80\x9cproposed changing the structure from establishing a joint holding companyâ
\x80¦ to a structure where Honda would be the parent company and Nissan the subsidiary through a share exchangeâ\x80\x9d. As a result of the talks, both companies concluded that â\x80\x9cit would be most appropriate to cease discussions and terminate the MOU,â\x80\x9d the statement said. They will, however, continue to â\x80\x9ccollaborate within the framework of a strategic partnership aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles, striving to create new value and maximise the corporate value of both companiesâ\x80\x9d, it added. The automakers, and junior partner Mitsubishi Motors, had announced they would consider the merger late last year. Sources later told Reuters that Mitsubishi was unlikely to participate. Honda and Nissan have seen their industry and the key China market upended by the rapid rise ofChinese electric vehicle makerssuch as BYD, and both are facing the prospect of tariffs in the US, another key market. With the collapse of merger talks, Nissan is now open to working with new partners, with Taiwanâ\x80\x99s Foxconn seen as one candidate. Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said on Wednesday it would consider taking a stake in Nissan but that its main aim was cooperation.

https://apnews.com/article/canada-united-states-fentanyl-czar-1cc5c1832581d3693c4663c0c6145e04,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — The man appointed by the Canadian government to help stop fentanyl from entering the United States said his goal is to totally eliminate the drug crossing the border. “Getting the number to zero is a goal and should be our goal,” Kevin Brosseau, a former member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a former national security and intelligence adviser, said Wednesday. “If it’s one pound, 10 pounds, we all know the amount of deaths that possibly could represent. We should be focused on eliminating the scourge that is fentanyl in this country and in the United States,” he said. The Canadian government announced Brosseau’s appointment as its fentanyl czar Tuesday. The move was partly in response to President Donald Trump saying the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the U.S. was a reason for threatening to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods – with an exception of 10% on energy. Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4. “This is a clear demonstration of how serious Canada is taking the fentanyl crisis in his country and how important our relationship is with our American counterparts,” said Brosseau, who was speaking after touring a Canada Border Services Agency port of entry facility in Lansdowne, Ontario. Brosseau said his job will be to work to integrate the different levels of law enforcement. “I’m hoping to be able to give an intensity to the work,” he said. “My mandate is clear, to be able to bring people together to integrate the work and produce results.” Figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) show the agency seized 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) of fentanyl at the northern border last year. That compares to 9,570 kilograms (21,098 pounds) at the southwestern border. Brosseau spent more than 20 years in the RCMP, where he served as a deputy commissioner and the senior Mountie in the province of Manitoba. More recently, he was deputy national security and intelligence adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Brosseau said he plans on meeting with Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, and other U.S. officials soon. “I’ve spent a number of years working in law enforcement,” he said. “I know how important those relationships, those collaborations are on the ground. We’re stronger together.” Besides appointing Brosseau, the Canadian government has also announced it is spending CDN$1.3 billion (US$910 million) on increased border security which includes new helicopters, technology and personnel. Speaking at the same event, David McGuinty, Canada’s public safety minister, was asked about the challenges on dealing with President Trump. “There’s a lot at stake for people in the United States and in Canada,” said McGuinty. “There is a way to find our way forward here. I think the administration knows that.” “I think it’s going to take cool heads and a disciplined approach to find our way forward.” McGuinty also reacted to Trump’s continued statements about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state. “Canada is an independent and sovereign country,” he said. “It will remain. So that’s just not up for discussion.” ___ This story has been updated to correct the U.S. dollar conversion for the increased spending to $910 million, not $91 million.",Canada’s new fentanyl czar says goal is to totally stop the drug from entering the US,Jim Morris,AP News,2025-02-12T21:50:38,2025-02-12T22:35:09,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-human-rights-hasina-yunus-volker-turk-united-nations-951dc40f60d6a798eb5af5ed1d11bbad,"GENEVA (AP) — The U.N. human rights office on Wednesday estimated that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks last summer in a crackdown on student-led protests against the now-ousted former prime minister. In a new report, the Geneva-based office says security and intelligence services “systematically engaged” in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity and require further investigation. Citing “various credible sources,” the rights office said it estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed in the protests between July 15 and Aug. 5 — the day longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India amid the uprising. Thousands more were injured in the weeks leading up to and after the protests, and the vast majority of those killed and injured “were shot by Bangladesh’s security forces,” the report said. AP correspondent Mimmi Montgomery reports on new United Nations data finding hundreds of people were killed in Bangladesh’s crackdown on student-led protesters. Over 11,700 people were detained, the report said, citing information from security services. It said that about 12 to 13% of people estimated to have be killed —- or as many as about 180 people — were children. In some cases, “security forces engaged in summary executions by deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at point blank range,” it said. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk cited signs that “extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture” were conducted with the knowledge and coordination of the political leadership and top security officials as a way to suppress the protests. The U.N. fact-finding team was deployed to Bangladesh at the invitation of the country’s interim leader, the Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, to look into the uprising and violent crackdown. The team of investigators said the interim government has reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with attacks on religious and indigenous groups. The report said “many perpetrators of acts of revenge, violence and attacks on distinct groups apparently continue to enjoy impunity.” The human rights situation in Bangladesh continues to raise concerns, the U.N. office said. While the government has changed, “the system has not necessarily changed,” Rory Mungoven, head of the rights office’s Asia-Pacific region, told reporters. “Many officials and people who had served or been appointed under the previous regime continue to function,” he said. Such a situation creates “a potential conflict of interest” and could impede reforms and accountability, Mungoven added. The investigators issued dozens of recommendations to the government, such as steps to improve the justice system and setting up a witness protection program. It also recommended banning the use of lethal firearms by security forces to disperse crowds unless they are faced with “imminent threat of death or serious injury.” In a statement after the report was published, Yunus reiterated his government’s commitment to upholding the rule of law and said it was crucial to reform the country’s law enforcement and justice sectors. “I call on everyone working inside these institutions to side with justice, the law, and the people of Bangladesh in holding to account their own peers and others who have broken the law and violated the human and civil rights of their fellow citizens,” he said. What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party. A High Court decision in early June that reinstated the quota system was the “immediate trigger” to the protests, which were also fueled by long standing grievances about economic inequality and a lack of rights, the report said. —— AP writer Julhas Alam in Dhaka contributed to the report.","UN rights office estimates up to 1,400 killed in crackdown on protests in Bangladesh",JAMEY KEATEN,AP News,2025-02-12T09:31:48,2025-02-12T04:25:10,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-claims-positive-signs-as-qatar-egypt-scramble-to-resolve-gaza-truce-crisis/,"As Israeli and American officials continued to threaten Hamas on Wednesday, several reports said Egypt and Qatar were intensifying efforts to save the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, with Cairo and the Palestinian terror group reportedly optimistic that the impasse could be solved. The ceasefire has looked increasingly fragile since Hamas said this week it was postponing the release of any more Israeli hostages held in Gaza until further notice, accusing Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement. US President Donald Trump then warned that â

Jerusalem also reiterated the threat of a renewal of the war, with Defense Minister Israel Katz warning that if Hamas does not release Israeli hostages by Saturday, “the gates of hell will open, just as the US president promised.”

Katz vowed that renewed fighting in Gaza “will be different in its intensity compared to before the ceasefire, and will not end without the defeat of Hamas and release all the hostages, and will also allow the realization of US President Trump’s vision for Gaza.”

Egyptian sources told Reuters that Qatar and Egypt were in discussions with Hamas and Israel to prevent the cancellation of the ceasefire deal and to ensure its completion.

Egypt’s state-affiliated Al Qahera news TV said the pressure by the mediators was intensifying, citing an Egyptian source.

A Palestinian source told AFP that Qatar and Egypt were “working extensively” to resolve the crisis, adding that the Arab mediators were in touch with the Trump administration as part of their effort.

A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Wednesday to continue ceasefire talks, the terror group said in a statement.

An Egyptian official with knowledge of the talks told AP that the two sides were close to an agreement. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said Israel had committed to delivering more tents, shelters and heavy equipment to Gaza.

An official with Hamas, Mahmoud Merdawi, cited “positive signals” that the hostages would be released on Saturday, the news agency said. But he cautioned that the group had yet to receive the guarantees it seeks from Israel regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Egypt and Qatar, alongside the United States, brokered the deal that took effect on January 19 after more than a year of extensive diplomatic efforts.

Sixteen Israeli hostages have been released since, out of 33 on a list to be freed in the 42-day first phase of the deal. In all, Hamas is holding 73 of the 251 hostages it abducted on October 7, 2023; some 30 of them are believed to be alive.

“They are working intensively to resolve the crisis and compel Israel to implement the humanitarian protocol in the ceasefire agreement and begin negotiations for the second phase,” added the unnamed Palestinian source. Israel has denied violations of the ceasefire, including claims that it has limited aid in Gaza.

On Tuesday, United Nations humanitarian aid officials reported there has been a spike in deliveries since the ceasefire started, but did not provide specific details that could settle the spat between Israel and Hamas.

The three-stage ceasefire agreement, reached last month, halted some 15 months of fighting triggered by the group’s October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel, when Hamas-led terrorists slaughtered some 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 hostages.

The deal requires Hamas to release all its hostages, Israel to release several thousand Palestinian security prisoners — including hundreds of terror convicts serving life sentences — and a halt to fighting in the Strip, followed by negotiations for a “sustainable calm” and IDF withdrawal from the enclave.

The three-week-old truce, only halfway through its first stage, has come under immense strain in recent days following Hamas’s announcement.

Hamas praises Jordan and Egypt for opposing Gazans’ relocation

Meanwhile, Hamas praised Jordan and Egypt on Wednesday for their repeated rejections of Trump’s plan to take over Gaza and displace its population to the two neighboring countries.

The terror group said in a separate statement that the Jordanian and Egyptian positions “confirm that there is an Arab plan to reconstruct Gaza without displacing its people.”

The US plan was at the top of the agenda during Trump’s Tuesday Oval Office meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah, who sought to cautiously repel the idea without upsetting Trump.

He announced that Amman would take in 2,000 sick Gazan children — a figure that amounts to 0.1% of the Strip’s population.

“That’s music to my ears,” said a gratified Trump, who still proceeded to raise the idea of using “parcels of land” in Egypt and Jordan to house Palestinians.

Abdullah responded that he’d have to do what was best for his country, adding that Arab countries, led by Egypt, were putting together their plan for the rehabilitation of Gaza.

Hours later, the Egyptian foreign ministry announced that it would soon be presenting its plan for a “comprehensive vision for the reconstruction” of the Gaza Strip that ensures Palestinians remain on the territory.

Egypt announced earlier this week it would hold an “emergency Arab summit” on February 27 addressing Trump’s plan.

Notably, the White House readout on the meeting between Trump and Abdullah made no direct mention of Trump’s desire for Jordan to take in Palestinians.

“The two leaders also discussed the President’s goal of ensuring that Gaza is rebuilt beautifully after the conflict ends and providing options for the people of Gaza that allow them to live in security and dignity, and free of Hamas’s tyranny,” it said.

Trump asked Jordan’s King Abdullah to help ensure that Hamas understands “the severity of the situation” if the terror group does not release the hostages by Saturday, the readout added. Abdullah is not known to have noteworthy contacts with Hamas.

“The president reiterated that Hamas must release all hostages, including all Americans, by Saturday, and asked for the King’s assistance in ensuring that Hamas, as well as the leaders of the region, understand the severity of the situation,” the US readout added.

Trump extended a White House invitation to Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, with onlookers believing the visit would come shortly after that of Abdullah.

But such a sit-down has yet to be scheduled, apparently as Cairo seeks to finalize its Gaza plan first.

An unconfirmed report from Reuters citing anonymous Egyptian security sources claimed Wednesday that Sissi would not travel to Washington if Trump’s plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza remains on the agenda — a likely unrealistic expectation, given that Trump has repeatedly stood by the plan.

Sissi and Abdullah held a phone call on Wednesday, during which they reiterated their stance that Gaza should be rebuilt without displacing Palestinians, according to Egypt’s presidency.

“The two leaders affirmed the unity of the Egyptian and Jordanian positions, including the necessity of the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, the continued release of hostages and prisoners and facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid,” the Egyptian readout said, stressing the need for the “immediate start of the reconstruction process in the Gaza Strip, without displacing the Palestinian people from their land.”

The aversion to Trump’s plan is widespread in the Arab world. The United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, said on Wednesday that the US approach to Gaza is “difficult.”

“But at the end of the day, we’re all in a solution-seeking business. We just don’t know where it’s going to land yet,” he said during the World Governments Summit in Dubai.

At the summit, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit warned that if Trump pressed ahead with his plan, he would lead the Middle East into a new cycle of crises with a “damaging effect on peace and stability.”","Hamas claims ‘positive signs’ as Qatar, Egypt scramble to resolve Gaza truce crisis","Agencies, Jacob Magid, Emanuel Fabian",The Times of Israel,2025-02-12T18:21:44,2025-02-12T22:43:17,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/russia-syria-putin-sharaa-cc60fa41024e200cf1d0f6f8022bfb1c,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday spoke to Syria’s new leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, the first such top-level contact since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad. The Kremlin said the “constructive and business-like” conversation touched upon “acute issues of practical cooperation in trade and economic, education and other spheres,” adding that the leaders agreed to continue contacts to develop a “broad agenda for the development of bilateral cooperation.” The call followed last month’s visit to Damascus by a delegation of Russian officials, which marked the first such trip since Assad was ousted in December and granted an asylum in Russia. Moscow had staunchly backed Assad throughout Syria’s civil war and since 2015 waged a military that helped his government reclaim control over most of the country. Following Assad’s fall, Russia relocated its troops and assets from all over Syria to its main hub at the Hmeimim air base near Latakia. The Kremlin and the interim government in Damascus have said that the fate of the Russian air base and the nearby naval facility in Tartus will be discussed in future negotiations. At his annual news conference in December, Putin said Russia offered Syria’s new leaders to use the Russian bases for humanitarian aid deliveries and suggested Moscow could offer other incentives. The new Syrian authorities have terminated a contract for a Russian company to modernize the Tartus commercial port, but that move did not directly impact the Russian naval facility, which was leased under a separate deal.","Putin has a 'constructive' conversation in first call with Syria's new leader, Kremlin says",,AP News,2025-02-12T15:17:37,2025-02-12T12:15:23,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/eu-us-tariffs-trump-trade-war-leyen-0b23d25d30428eb288b79bfda4fa25e9,"BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum “will not go unanswered,” European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Tuesday, adding that they will trigger tough countermeasures from the 27-nation bloc. It means iconic U.S. industries like bourbon, jeans and motorcycles should beware. “The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,” von der Leyen said in a statement in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum on Monday. “Tariffs are taxes — bad for business, worse for consumers,” von der Leyen said. “Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered — they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.” The EU trade minister scheduled a first emergency video meeting on the bloc’s response on Tuesday. “It is also important that everyone sticks together. Difficult times require such full solidarity,” said Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU presidency. Just as Trump imposed similar tariffs during his first presidency, the EU countermeasures could easily amount to those that were used to retaliate then if the measures come into force March 12. Bernd Lange, the chair of the European Parliament’s trade committee, warned that previous trade measures were only suspended and could legally be easily revived. “When he starts again now, then we will, of course, immediately reinstate our countermeasures,” Lange told rbb24 German radio. ”Motorcycles, jeans, peanut butter, bourbon, whiskey and a whole range of products that of course also affect American exporters” would be targeted, he added. The EU Commission, which negotiates trade relations on behalf of the bloc, said it is not clear what countermeasures would apply, but officials and observers have said they would target Republican states and traditionally strong U.S. exports. In Germany, the EU’s largest economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told parliament that “if the U.S. leaves us no other choice, then the European Union will react united,” adding: “Ultimately, trade wars always cost both sides prosperity.” European steel companies are bracing for losses. “It will further worsen the situation of the European steel industry, exacerbating an already dire market environment,” said Henrik Adam, president of the Eurofer European steel association. He said the EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports. The United States is the second biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports. “Losing a significant part of these exports cannot be compensated by EU exports to other markets.” Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax in the hope that they will give local producers relief from intense global competition, allowing them to charge higher prices. EU Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič said that the tariffs are “economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains established through our extensive transatlantic trade and investment ties.” “We will protect our workers, businesses and consumers,” Šefčovič said, but added that “it is not our preferred scenario. We remain committed to constructive dialog. We stand ready for negotiations and to find mutually beneficial solutions where possible.” The EU estimates that the trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing some 30% of global trade. “There is a lot at stake for both sides,” he told the EU legislature. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services. The EU says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth 688 billion euros ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros ($107 billion) for the EU. ___ Associated Press writers Geir Moulson in Berlin and Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.",EU vows to retaliate against Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum,Raf Casert,AP News,2025-02-11T08:33:15,2025-02-11T09:49:10,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-turkey-erdogan-visit-defense-economic-talks-8ae96251f8743896605e8d2c31d0fab1,"BOGOR, Indonesia (AP) — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto on Wednesday for talks aimed at strengthening economic and defense ties between the two Muslim-majority nations. Erdogan’s state visit to Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country and Southeast Asia’s largest economy, was his second stop in a four-day visit that also includes Malaysia and Pakistan. Turkey and Indonesia held their first High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council summit after agreeing to create the forum at the G20 Summit in Bali in 2022. The discussions focused on current regional and global issues, particularly the war in Gaza, the two leaders said in a joint news conference after the meeting. Subianto said the meeting was “intensive and productive” and the two countries share a commitment to strengthen their partnership. “President Erdogan’s visit is a new chapter in our strategic partnership,” he added. Indonesia has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinians and Subianto said the two countries share the same view about the importance of a cease-fire and of resolving the Palestinian problem through a two-state solution. Erdogan said he appreciated Indonesia’s firm stance on the Palestinian issue and repeated a call for Israel to pay for the reconstruction of Gaza.. Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. He estimated the total damage caused by Israel’s 15-month-long attacks is approaching $100 billion, adding that “the principle in law is that damages should be collected from the person responsible.” Erdogan and his wife, First Lady Emine Erdogan, arrived in Jakarta late Tuesday and was welcomed by Subianto at Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport in a light rain. Erdogan rode with Subianto in a motorcade to his hotel. Indonesia and Turkey have built an increasingly close relationship in recent years, and the two leaders previously met in Ankara last July when Subianto was still president-elect and defense minister. Subianto pledged to “elevate defense cooperation and other strategic fields for mutual benefit.” The two countries signed a defense cooperation agreement in 2010, under which Indonesia’s state-run arms producer Pindad and Turkey’s FNSS jointly developed a new model of medium tank. In 2023, the two countries inked a plan of action for joint military exercises and defense industry cooperation. In addition to Indonesia, Turkey has HLSCC cooperation forums with 21 other countries, including Pakistan. The two leaders on Wednesday also witnessed the signing of a dozen agreements between Turkey and Indonesia, including on trade, investment, education, energy, agriculture, health and religious services. The two leaders also signed deal on the joint development of a Baykar combat-drone factory in Indonesia, and Erdogan pledged his country would invest in the development of Indonesia’s new capital on Borneo island. “We are trying to increase our trade by $10 billion per year with the same balance,” Erdogan said. Erdogan will head on to Pakistan on Wednesday, where he and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will address the Pakistan-Turkey Business and Investment Forum and attend another HSLCC meeting. ___ Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.

https://apnews.com/article/japan-us-tariffs-steel-aluminum-exemption-be1b1c2cb912af55edf4748119b3953a,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan ‘s government said Wednesday it asked the U.S. to exclude it from 25% steel and aluminum tariffs, a change from duty-free quotas that Tokyo was given previously. Japan made the request through its embassy in Washington after U.S. President Donald Trump removed the exceptions and exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel imports to a minimum of 25%, while hiking aluminum tariffs to 25% from 10%. “Japan will firmly take necessary steps as we fully examine details of the new measures and their possible impact on the Japanese economy,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, suggesting that his country will lobby for an exemption in the coming weeks before the measures are due to take effect. The measures announced by Trump are part of his aggressive push to reset global trade in the belief that tax hikes on foreign-made products will strengthen domestic manufacturing. Japan was given an annual duty-free quota of up to 1.25 million tons of steel under the former President Joe Biden ’s administration. Japan’s exported 1.18 million tons of steel to the U.S. in 2024, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-netanyahu-troops-beefed-up-ceasefire-39533292445c3fe25d0d2d460439305d,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday threatened to withdraw from the ceasefire in Gaza and directed troops to prepare to resume fighting Hamas if the militant group does not r elease more hostages on Saturday. Hamas said Monday — and reiterated Tuesday — that it planned to delay the release of three more hostages after accusing Israel of failing to meet the terms of the ceasefire, including by not allowing an agreed-upon number of tents and other aid into Gaza. Amid the mounting tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump emboldened Israel to call for the release of even more remaining hostages on Saturday. Trump questions ceasefire’s durability After meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday, Trump predicted Hamas would not release all the remaining hostages as he had demanded. “I don’t think they’re going to make the deadline, personally,” the president said of Hamas. “They want to play tough guy. We’ll see how tough they are.” Since the ceasefire took effect, Hamas has released 21 hostages in a series of five exchanges for more than 730 Palestinian prisoners. A second phase calls for the return of all remaining hostages and an indefinite extension of the truce. However, Trump’s statements about both the pending releases and plans for post-war Gaza have destabilized its fragile architecture. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Netanyahu’s threat referred to the three hostages scheduled for release on Saturday or all the remaining hostages, which would be a departure from the terms of the ceasefire. Netanyahu’s office said it “welcomed President Trump’s demand.” As Trump spoke to reporters in Washington and reasserted his demands, an Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting, said Israel was “sticking to Trump’s announcement regarding the release of the hostages. Namely, that they will all be released on Saturday.” Netanyahu’s office also said it ordered the military to mobilize troops on and around the Gaza Strip in preparation for scenarios that could arise. Trump has said Israel should cancel the entire ceasefire if all of the roughly 70 hostages aren’t freed by Saturday. Hamas brushed off his threat Tuesday, doubling down on its claim that Israel has violated the ceasefire and warned that it would only continue releasing hostages if all parties adhered to the ceasefire. “Trump must remember there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties. This is the only way to bring back prisoners,” Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said Tuesday. “The language of threats has no value; it only complicates matters.” The group later condemned Trump’s White House remarks, saying they amounted to a “call for ethnic cleansing” and accusing Trump of seeking to “liquidate the Palestinian cause and deny the national rights of the Palestinian people.” It said in a statement it remained committed to the ceasefire, yet did not address its plans to suspend the hostages releases outlined in the first phase of the agreement. Jordan — a U.S. ally — faces new pressures Trump hosted King Abdullah II in Washington as he escalates pressure on Jordan to take in refugees from Gaza, perhaps permanently, as part of his audacious plan to remake the Middle East. “We’re not going to buy anything. We’re going to have it,” Trump said of U.S. control of Gaza as the Jordanian king stood by. Abdullah II was asked repeatedly by reporters about Trump’s plan to remake the Middle East, but didn’t make substantive comments. He also did not comment on the idea that a large number of refugees from Gaza could be welcomed in Jordan, where millions of Palestinian refugees already reside. The king said, however, that Jordan would be willing “right away” to take as many as 2,000 children in Gaza who have cancer or are otherwise ill. Last week, the top World Health Organization official for Gaza said between 12,000 and 14,000 patients still need medical evacuation from the territory — including 5,000 children. Palestinians and the international community have seethed over Trump’s recent comments that any Palestinians potentially expelled from Gaza would not have a right to return. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas committed to freeing 33 hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, while Israel said it would release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The sides have carried out five swaps since Jan. 19. The war could resume in early March if no agreement is reached on the more complicated second phase of the ceasefire. But if it does, Israel will face a drastically different battlefield. After forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to evacuate to southern Gaza in the early stages of the war, Israel allowed many of those displaced people to return to what is left of their homes, posing a new challenge to its ability to move ground troops through the territory. ___ Metz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-critical-chemicals-act-save-shrinking-industry-france/,"Europe's mighty chemicals industry is in decline — but France is pitching a plan to get it back on track. Once one of the jewels of European manufacturing, the chemicals' sector has been plunged into a deep malaise over recent years, at least in part because of a surge in energy costs. The crisis reached fever pitch when even German heavyweight BASF said last year that it would be making a multibillion investment in China, as it had found business tough in its home market. In a bid to keep the business in Europe, Paris wants the European Union to declare 15 key chemical compounds ""strategic,"" copying similar EU policies for raw materials and medicines. The idea is to protect the sector to ensure Europe remains self-sufficient in chemicals used in everything from fertilizer production to plastics manufacturing. France, a top global chemical producer, warns the sector is facing a ""major crisis,"" citing a 12 percent drop in production between 2019 and 2023, which it blames on rising energy costs and ""fierce or even unfair competition from non-EU countries."" ""Regarding petrochemistry alone, by 2035, about 20 steam crackers may be shut down, affecting 50,000 jobs, if no collective action is taken,"" reads the draft proposal obtained by POLITICO. The proposed ""Critical Chemicals Act"" would identify 15 molecules as ""strategic,"" bringing them under an EU ""strategic project"" label to enable funding access. The idea borrows from the Critical Raw Materials Act — under which ""strategic projects"" can benefit from faster permitting procedures and additional funding — and the Critical Medicines Act. Those ""strategic"" molecules are to be the building blocks for other industries, with substances like ammonia and methanol supporting agriculture and energy, and ethylene, propylene, butadiene and benzene serving the petrochemical industry. France is Europe's second-largest producer of chemicals with a turnover of €108.5 billion in 2023, according to the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC). Europe is the second-largest chemicals producer in the world after China. According to the proposal, the act should also create support schemes for chemical plants that need investment to decarbonize and modernize, as well as for chemical plants whose closure would “jeopardize European sovereignty.” The act is an ""opportunity to acknowledge this needed [green] transition and support frontrunners in this matter,"" said Noémie Jégou, chemicals policy officer at the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), highlighting the energy-intensive sector's contribution to climate change. ""But we must ensure strategic priorities do focus on non-toxic and clean chemicals and do not come at the expense of human health and the environment."" CEFIC, for its part, welcomed France's concern for the chemicals industry — but said further work is needed to ""refine and confirm that this is the right approach."" Competing chemicals The past few years have seen steady job cuts in the chemical sector, most recently at Dow. CEFIC warned last month that Europe's chemical industry is at a “breaking point”: Over 11 million tons of capacity have already been announced for closure affecting 21 major sites, it said. France points to the gap in energy and feedstock costs between the EU and other industrial regions, due largely to soaring gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The paper also complains of ""sometimes unfair"" competition from non-EU producers — citing Europe's struggling polyvinyl chloride (PVC) industry as an example — and of a contraction in the activity of downstream markets for chemical products, like the automotive industry. German Chemical Industry Association President Markus Steilemann has accused Brussels of “regulating Europe into a standstill,” describing it as the “epicenter of bureaucracy.” France, too, hints at the need to simplify EU green rules, urging that incoming laws on chemical safety and forever chemicals ""take into account the competitiveness of the European chemical industry."" Non-EU imported chemicals should also ""abide by high-level standards in place in the EU regarding the protection of the environment and human health,"" the paper states. The EEB's Jégou acknowledged the industry downturn but insisted it remains ""in a very competitive situation."" And while she welcomed the proposal's pledge not to compromise environmental protections, the NGO is ""concerned about potential conflicts between some molecules’ strategic status and their environmental and health impacts,"" singling out the proposal's focus on PVC and flame-retardant materials. CEFIC said it shared France's objective of ""preserving the production of chemicals in Europe for which resilience is crucial"" — but has reservations about the proposal's definition of strategic molecules. It argues that ""not only basic building blocks are at risk"" but ""some key derivatives as well."" ""It is also difficult to determine if similar measures to the Critical Raw Materials Act and the Critical Medicines Act would benefit the chemical sector, given the limited experience,"" the lobby added, calling for a ""deeper reflection of the measures that would help the sector"" after the upcoming publication of the Clean Industrial Deal.",France pitches plan to halt decline of EU chemical industry,Leonie Cater,POLITICO,2025-02-12T03:36:35,2025-02-12T03:36:45,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/02/12/2003831728,"Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) and Minister of Culture Li Yuan (李遠) yesterday held a meeting in New Taipei City to discuss “cultural diplomacy,” with a particular focus on the upcoming World Expo in Japan and cultural events in European nations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) in a statement said it was the first time the two ministries held ministerial-level talks. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois Wu (吳志中) and Deputy Minister of Culture Minister Sue Wang (王時思) were also in attendance. During the meeting, both sides talked about combining MOFA and the Ministry of Culture’s resources to boost the nation’s visibility on the world stage, the statement said. One focus was the Osaka World Expo, which is to be held from April 13 to Oct. 13, it added. Lin proposed that Taiwan work closely with allies to hold activities and stage artistic performances during the Osaka event. Another focus for both ministries is to take advantage of the National Palace Museum’s upcoming exhibitions in the Czech Republic and France later this year, and the ministries would work together to hold a series of cultural and artistic events promoting Taiwan’s diverse culture with the theme of “Taiwan Culture Year,” the statement said. MOFA said the ministries worked together last year when the nation participated in the Paris Cultural Olympiad during the Olympic Games. They set up a Taiwan Pavilion at Parc de la Villette from July 27 to Aug. 10, with 22 Taiwanese performing arts groups appearing. DRIVING IN ESTONIA In other news, MOFA yesterday said that people who have a driver’s license issued in Taiwan, an international driving permit and a translation of the driver’s license in Estonian can now drive in Estonia, adding that it is considering offering a reciprocal deal to the European nation. Department of European Affairs Deputy Director-General Josephine Lee (李秀窈) said the Estonian Transport Administration announced the policy on its Web site. “Visitors who hold a valid Taiwan driver’s license and will not be staying in Estonia for more than 12 months, can now use the original copy of their driver’s license, the original copy of their international driving permit and a translation of the driver’s license in Estonian to drive in Estonia,” Lee said. Those wishing to obtain an Estonian translation of their driver’s license can visit the Web site of the Estonian Ministry of Justice and Digital Affairs () and contact a sworn translator of their choice to obtain a translation, Lee said. The cost of the translation is generally 60 to 100 euros (US$62 to US$103), and usually they receive it in two to three working days, she said, adding the translated document does not need to be further certified by the consular service office in Estonia. “The policy makes it more convenient for Taiwanese tourists and businesspeople,” Lee said. “MOFA welcomes and thanks the Estonian government for offering it to our people.” Based on the principle of reciprocity, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications is considering offering the same treatment to Estonians visiting Taiwan, she said. Meanwhile, Lee said the Greek government on Feb. 2 declared a state of emergency in Santorini, a popular tourist island hit by a series of earthquakes, and it would remain in effect until early next month. “MOFA reminds people who are planning to visit the area to stay alert and pay attention to the Greek government’s latest announcements, and avoid entering zones that have been deemed unsafe,” she said. People who need emergency assistance when visiting Greece are advised to call the Taipei Representative Office in Greece’s emergency phone number, or ask their family or friends in Taiwan to call the ministry’s all-hours emergency hotline, Lee said.",Ministries eyeing ‘cultural diplomacy’,Lee I-chia,Taipei Times,2025-02-12T00:00:00,2025-02-12T14:11:29,gemini-2.0-flash

https://kyivindependent.com/fires-reported-following-missile-attack-on-kyiv/,"Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a missile attack against Kyiv on the morning of Feb. 12, killing one person and injuring four others, including a child. Various officials reported that fires had broken out in different neighborhoods of the city. At least one person was killed and four others injured, including a 9-year-old girl, in the Obolon district of the city after a Russian missile struck an office building, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. At least two of the injured victims required hospitalization. In the Holosiivskyi district, a large fire engulfed a warehouse, while in the Solomianskyi district, the roof of a residential building caught fire. An office of the state news channels Freedom TV and Dim were damaged in the attack, the channels said in a statement, reporting no casualties. Explosions were reported in Kyiv around 4:30 a.m. local time, according to several Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. Preliminary reports indicate that four Iskander ballistic missiles were launched towards the capital. Ukraine's Air Force warned immediately prior of the threat of Russian missile attacks targeting various regions of the country. The air raid alerts were lifted about an hour later at 5:30 a.m. local time. Damage was also reported elsewhere in Kyiv Oblast. A warehouse storing feed for animals from shelters was destroyed in Russian attacks in the region overnight, said the non-profit running the warehouse. No staff members were injured. In recent months, Russia has continued to intensify its drone and missile attacks targeting different regions of Ukraine.","Russian ballistic missile attack on Kyiv kills 1, injures 4",Dmytro Basmat,The Kyiv Independent,2025-02-11T21:56:39.000,2025-02-12T08:15:10.000,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj91d3jkpvlo,"When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Washington and meets President Donald Trump later on Thursday, there will be some warm hugs and shared laughs. But that will not be all. Trump and Modi have developed a strong personal rapport over the years, marked by high-profile meetings and joint appearances. This time, they will also hold a joint press briefing, according to the White House. Since their first meeting in Washington in 2017, their bond has grown through other events, including joint appearances at massive rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad. Their chemistry stems from shared worldviews and politics and a mutual strategic focus on countering China, a concern that has also strengthened the broader US-India partnership. Not surprisingly, Trump has often criticised India, but he has never criticised Modi. And so, during Modi's visit, the two leaders will probably spend time mapping out next steps in the US-India strategic partnership, which is already in a good place. Modi will reportedly meet several members of Trump's cabinet, as well as US business leaders and members of the Indian-American community. He may also meet SpaceX and Tesla chief Elon Musk. Modi, keen to scale up India's burgeoning electric vehicles sector, would be happy if Musk opened a Tesla factory in India. And yet the Trump-Modi conviviality and heady talk of strategic partnership may mask a sobering reality: during Modi's visit, the relationship's transactional side will come into sharp relief with each leader, especially Trump, armed with an array of demands. Delhi knows Trump well. Many of Modi's current cabinet ministers also served during his previous term, which overlapped with part of the first Trump administration. That familiarity has been on display since Trump's inauguration last month: Delhi has publicly signalled its willingness to lower tariffs, take back undocumented Indian immigrants and buy American oil. It has already lowered some tariffs and taken back 104 undocumented Indians, with the first plane arriving in India last week. These pre-emptive steps are meant to prevent Trump from making specific demands of India and to reduce the likelihood of tensions with the new Trump administration. Still, Trump may ask Modi to make additional tariff reductions, to further chip away at a US goods and services trade deficit with India that has approached $46bn (£37.10bn) in recent years. On Wednesday evening, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump planned to announce reciprocal tariffs on other countries before his meeting with Modi. But an obstacle could become an opportunity: Modi may call on Trump to enter into bilateral talks on an economic partnership accord meant to reduce tariffs on both sides. In recent years, Delhi has shown a growing willingness to pursue trade deals. The Trump administration may prove to be a more willing interlocutor than the Biden administration, which imposed heavy environmental and labour-related conditions on new trade agreements. What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? Trump may also ask Modi to take back more undocumented Indians. Given that some estimates put the number at more than 700,000 - the third-largest such group in the US - this will be a difficult and delicate issue for Delhi to navigate.  Last week, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament that the government was working with the US to ensure Indian citizens were not mistreated while being deported after reports of them being shackled sparked anger. Trump may also call on Modi to buy more American oil. In 2021, India was the top destination for American oil exports, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought major changes in global oil markets and prompted Delhi to ramp up imports of cheap oil from close partner Russia. The price point will determine how much oil India is willing to buy from the US. Modi may also come with his own energy ask: invest in Indian nuclear energy. Delhi is amending its nuclear liability law and has announced a new nuclear energy mission, in an attempt to sharpen international interest in the fuel. India aims to meet half its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. Asking Trump to invest in nuclear fuel amounts to a potential happy medium: it is cleaner than fossil fuels, but far removed from the solar and wind power that may not strike the Trump administration as an attractive investment. Technology will probably be discussed as well. This was a fast-growing space for bilateral relations in the Biden era, thanks to the 2022 implementation of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which both sides view as a new cornerstone for strategic partnership. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it. Modi will likely seek assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they remain committed to this. Given Washington's focus on countering China by making India a bigger part of tech global supply chains, they probably will. Also on the tech co-operation front, Modi may make a pitch for Trump to maintain the H-1B visa regime. These visas for highly skilled foreign workers, heavily criticised by some influential Trump supporters, have been awarded to large numbers of Indian tech employees in the US. Other countries may also come up during Modi's conversations in Washington. Iran could loom especially large. Delhi is partnering with Tehran to develop a port in Chabahar city - part of a broader Indian strategy to strengthen connectivity links with Central Asia, via Iran and Afghanistan. But last week, the US administration released a presidential memorandum outlining Trump's ","Trade, tariffs and visas to dominate Trump-Modi talks",Michael Kugelman,BBC News,2025-02-11T19:08:39,2025-02-13T01:20:50,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-war-threat-europe-within-5-years-danish-intelligence-ddis-warns/,"An updated threat assessment warns of the consequences of a divided NATO and an absent U.S. If Moscow perceives NATO as weak, Russia could be ready to wage a ""large-scale war"" in Europe within five years, the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS)has said. ""Russia is likely to be more willing to use military force in a regional war against one or more European NATO countries if it perceives NATO as militarily weakened or politically divided,"" states the report, which was released Tuesday. ""This is particularly true if Russia assesses that the U.S. cannot or will not support the European NATO countries in a war with Russia,"" it continues, emphasizing that Russia is ramping up its military capabilities to prepare for a possible war against NATO. The updated DDIS threat assessment comes as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to end the war in Ukraine, which enters its fourth year later this month. The agency offers three scenarios that could occur if the Ukraine conflict stops or becomes frozen, working from the assumption that Russia does not have the capacity to wage war with multiple countries at the same time. Within six months, the update projects, Russia would be able to wage a local war with a bordering country, while within two years it could launch a regional war in the Baltic Sea region. In five years, meanwhile, it could launch a large-scale attack on Europe, provided the U.S. does not get involved. The agency notes it did not factor in any possible increase in NATO defense capabilities. Trump hasurgedNATO members to increase their defense spending to 5 percent of GDP, more than double the current target, and has suggested the U.S. couldwithdraw from the military alliance if its allies don't pay their way. In 2024 Trumpsaidhe would ""encourage"" Russia to attack any NATO member country that didnâ	 meet its financial obligations.

https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-well-swap-one-territory-for-another-zelensky-on-trade-territory-in-potential-peace-talks-with-russia/,"Key developments on Feb. 11: President Volodymyr Zelensky said he planned to exchange territories if U.S. President Donald Trump succeeds in bringing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table, according to an interview with The Guardian published on Feb. 11. Ukraine launched a surprisecross-border incursioninto Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in anew offensive. The Ukrainian military continues to hold Russian territory that could play ""an important part"" infuture negotiations, Zelensky previously said. ""We will swap one territory for another,"" Zelensky toldThe Guardian, without specifying which Russian-occupied land Ukraine would seek in return. ""I don't know, we will see. But all our territories are important, there is no priority,"" he said. Talk of ending Russia'sfull-scale invasionof Ukraine has increased as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The new administration aims to end Russia's war against Ukraine100 daysfrom inauguration, Keith Kellogg, Trump's special Ukraine peace envoy, said on Jan. 8. According to sources in Ukraine's President's Office, cited byRBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after theMunich Security Conference. On Feb. 7, the U.S. president revealed he aims to meet Zelensky inWashingtonthe following week. He also recently said that the U.S. wants access to Ukraine'srare earth mineralsin exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners. Trump has alsoallegedlyspoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war. The U.S. president told the New York Post he had a concrete plan to end the war, adding, ""I hope it's fast. Every day, people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing."" Ukrainian forces struck Russia's Saratov oil refinery in a strike overnight on Feb. 11, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks in the region. Unverified videos posted to social media showed a large fire and search lights raking the sky reportedly in the vicinity of therefinery. ""The refinery mainly produces gasoline, fuel oil, and diesel fuel. In total, more than 20 types of oil products (are being produced there),"" theGeneral Staffsaid, adding that the facility suppliesRussianoccupation forces in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military reported a confirmed hit and a fire at the Rosneft facility. The full extent of damage is being determined, it added. The attack was carried out jointly by the Unmanned Systems Forces, the military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, as well as other units, according to the statement. The confirmation of the attack on the Saratov oil refinery came afterearlier reportsof a drone attack against the oil refinery lying some 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) fromUkraine'sborder. The Russian Telegram news channel Shot also reported at least 11 explosions over Engels, a city lying across the Volga River from Saratov. The Russian strategic aviationairbase Engels-2, which has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian long-range strikes, lies in the vicinity. The U.S. plans to review the deployment of its troops around the world but is not going to send them to Ukraine, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a press conference on Feb. 11. Hegseth's remarks come amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment ofpeacekeeping forcesif a ceasefire is negotiated. ""We are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine,"" Hegseth told reporters in Stuttgart, Germany, during hisvisitto U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command headquarters. Hegseth added that Washington currently has no plans to reduce the U.S. contingent abroad but will review its deployment by PresidentDonald Trump's strategic vision. The U.S. Defense Secretary also expressed hope for a swiftpeace agreementin Ukraine, which Trump has pledged to conclude. ""With hopefully a rapid peace deal in Ukraine, which the President (Donald Trump) is committed to delivering, we can then review force posture and encourage as you're going to see tomorrow (on Feb. 12) ... at the Ukraine contact group and the NATO ministerial, we're going to have straight talk with our friends,"" Hegseth said. Hegseth is expected to attend the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), also known as the Ramstein summit, as part of a tour of Germany, Belgium, and Poland, according to a Pentagonstatementpublished Feb. 7. At the summit, the defense secretary aims to ""reiterate President Trump's commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible,"" the statement read. However, this time, Hegseth is not likely to announce new military aid supplies, which was a regular occurrence during the Joe Biden administration, according to theWashington Post(WP). The Pentagon chief will not hold separate meetings with his Ukrainian counterparts but will rather be a ""listener"" at the Ramstein and at the meeting of NATO defense ministers on Feb. 13, an unnamed U.S. official told WP on condition of anonymity. The transition of power in Washington and expected changes in U.S. policy on Ukraine cast doubt on the future of the Ramstein summit. In February, for the first time since the establishment of the Ramstein format, the meeting wasconvened by the U.K., not the U.S. North Korea has provided Russia with around 200 long-range artillery pieces to boost its war effort against Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 11, citing South Korea's Defense Ministry. Seoul further warned that Pyongyang is likely preparing to send additional troops and arms to back Russia's war, confirmingearlier warningsby the Ukrainian intelligence. North Korea has reportedly also supplied ballistic missiles, millions of artillery shells, and other arms to Moscow. In addition, the country has deployed up to 12,000 troops to Russia's Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian cross-borderincursionlaunched in early August 2024. The South Korean Defense Ministry suspects that North Korea is receiving Russia's technological assistance with nuclear-powered submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in exchange for its military support,Yonhapreported. According to the Japanese public broadcaster NHK, North Korea is also expected to begindrone productionthis year with Russian technical assistance. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia's Kursk Oblast,South Korea's National Intelligence Service(NIS) claimed in mid-January. Ukraine placed North Korean losses to as many as 4,000 killed and injured. Kyiv's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov nevertheless predicted that North Korea might soon send reinforcements to Russia, namely gun and rocket artillery units. The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 thatNorth Koreantroops had been pulled from the front, and a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent at the time that Ukraine's special forces had not facedPyongyang's soldiersfor three weeks. On Feb. 7, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that North Korean soldiers were ""brought in again"" to Kursk Oblast, a day after Russian media claimed Ukraine hadlaunched a new offensivein the Russian region. Soldiers of the 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, part of the Steel Lions unit, shared footage on Feb. 11 showing a rare Russian Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher being destroyed by drones in the Lyman sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast. Drones have played a pivotal role for bothUkraineandRussiathroughout thefull-scale invasion, used extensively for reconnaissance and combat operations. According to the brigade'sstatement, Russian forces had mounted a Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher on a Ural vehicle and concealed it in the forests of the Lyman sector before it was targeted and destroyed. Ukraine has developed and deployed a wide range of aerial, naval, and ground-baseddronesfor battlefield operations. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv delivered more than200,000 domestically produced dronesto front-line units in December alone. The Smerch-2 is a Soviet-era rocket and bomb launcher designed to destroy submarines and attack torpedoes.

El Paso's public bus fixed route transportation servicewill be running on a reduced Sunday schedule for a week starting on Wednesday, Feb. 12, due to the impact and damage from the two-alarm blaze at Sun Metro headquarters, city officials said. The fire 		 which was initially described as a vehicle explosion 		 started in a bus maintenance garage area around 1 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 11, at the Sun Metro Operations Center at 10151 Montana Ave. near Wedgewood Drive, El Paso Fire Department Assistant Chief Robert Arvizu said. The two-alarm fire was knocked down by 4:40 p.m. Tuesday even as crews continued to check for hot spots and an investigation continued, the El Paso Fire Department said via the X platform. Five people were injured in the explosion, Arvizu said. Four people were taken to hospitals, while another declined to go to the hospital, officials said. One person suffered serious injuries and three people suffered minor injuries. Three other people declined to go to the hospital. About 48 fire units and more than 100 firefighters responded to the fire, Arvizu said. The fire caused ""severe damage"" to the Sun Metro Operations Center, Arvizu said. ""The roof collapsed,"" Arvizu said. ""We had walls collapse but none of the firefighters were injured.		 El Paso Fire Department officials are conducting an investigation into the fire, Arvizu said. El Paso police officers responded to the scene to assist the fire department with traffic control, including the closure of the normally busy Montana Avenue. Montana Avenue between Wedgewood and Yarbrough drives was closed to traffic for several hours. The closure was necessary because fire crews were using fire hydrants and water lines across the street. Firefighters in ladder trucks were working to extinguish the fire as a large plume of black smoke came from the Sun Metro Operations Center. The dark smoke plume could be seen for miles across El Paso. Additional fire trucks were still arriving at the scene as of 2 p.m. Firefighting efforts continued despite gusty winds and hazy skies before a dust storm blew into the city. El Paso city officials said details about the fire and its cause are limited, adding, ""our primary focus is on containing the fire and the safety of our staff."" El Paso International Airport operations are unaffected, city officials said. ""Our hearts and prayers are with the Sun Metro team members, who were injured in the incident at the Transit Operations Center. We are keeping them and their families in our thoughts,""City Manager Dionne Macksaid in a statement. ""As we work through this challenging situation, riders may experience service impacts, including delays on some routes,"" Mack said. ""We appreciate our riders' patience and understanding during this difficult period. We also are deeply grateful to our first responders for their swift action and support."" Sun Metrohas a ridership of about 22,900 passengers daily on weekdays and has a fleet of more than 300 vehicles, including buses, paratransit vans for the disabled and support vehicles.

https://www.dw.com/en/algeria-nigeria-niger-sign-mou-on-gas-pipeline-to-europe/a-62633283,"Algeria, Niger and Nigeria signed a memorandum of understanding on Thursday to build a 4,000-kilometer (2,500-mile) Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline. Algeria's Energy Ministry said the natural gas pipeline would stretch across the Sahara desert. It is estimated that, once the $13 billion (€12.75 billion) pipeline is complete, it will transport up to 30 billion cubic meters (1 trillion cubic feet) of gas annually from Nigeria, in West Africa, north through Niger and on to Algeria. From there, it could be pumped through the undersea 
Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline to Europe or loaded onto Liquefied Natural Gas tankers for export. Gas pipeline in the works for a while
The idea was first proposed over 40 years ago, but progress stalled. The new momentum comes as the European Union seeks to wean itself off Russian gas during the war in Ukraine. The security situation in the Sahel region and tensions between the governments in Algiers and Niamey also delayed the project. It wasn't until 2021, when Algeria and Niger reopened their border, that discussions to construct the pipeline restarted. Earlier this week, EU member states agreed to reduce gas consumption as concerns grow that Russia might cut off already decreasing deliveries. European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had said the deal to reduce gas use was about preventing the Kremlin from being able to blackmail the EU with gas deliveries: to stop ""Russia using gas as a weapon,"" as she put it.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250211001653315?section=national/politics,"(ATTN: ADDS more details in paras 17-20)By Lee Haye-ah SEOUL, Feb. 11 (Yonhap) -- Former Interior Minister Lee Sang-min denied Tuesday that he ordered cutting off power and water to major media outlets during the short-lived imposition of martial law or received such instructions from President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee made the remarks as a witness during the seventh formal hearing of Yoon's impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, referring to allegations in the prosecution's indictment of Yoon that the president ordered him around midnight on Dec. 3 to cut off power and water to Hankyoreh, the Kyunghyang Shinmun, MBC and JTBC -- left-leaning media outlets critical of Yoon -- as well as opinion polling agency Flower Research.  ""Such measures were completely excluded from the martial law (decree) so I don't think there was reason to give such instructions,"" Lee said. ""It was a known fact that the interior minister has no authority to command the police or the firefighting agency, and the president knew that better than anyone, so he would not have given me such form of instructions,"" he added. Lee did acknowledge however that he saw a note on Yoon's desk headed with the word ""National Fire Agency chief"" and listing the names of the media outlets and the polling agency. ""I saw a few notes from afar inside the president's office and one of them mentioned the fire agency cutting off power and water,"" he said. The minister also testified that he tried to stop Yoon from declaring martial law when he was called to the presidential office on the night of Dec. 3. ""After 11 Cabinet members had gathered, President Yoon reentered wearing a suit and we discouraged the president,"" he said. ""President Yoon, however, said he is aware of its economic and diplomatic impact, and the political burden it would be, but that he had thought carefully and that a president's situation awareness and sense of crisis and responsibility were completely different from those of a Cabinet member."" Prior to Lee's testimony, Yoon asked the bench for a chance to speak. He voiced his opposition to the Constitutional Court using as evidence the prosecution's reports on interrogations of key suspects in the martial law case, saying the testimonies are inconsistent because they were given to multiple investigation agencies. Acting court President Moon Hyung-bae said he would raise the issue with the other justices. The trial has entered its final stretch with only one more scheduled hearing on Thursday, though the court could still designate additional sessions. Later Tuesday, National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik, who was also called as a witness, recalled that during a dinner with Yoon and others at a presidential safe house sometime between late March and early April, the president mentioned the need for an ""exceptional measure."" ""I understood it as the military needing to play a role in real politics,"" Shin said. ""I didn't think as far as martial law, and expressed my opinion that it would not be appropriate in any event."" Shin, who was the defense minister at the time, also said he rejected the idea as ""not very useful,"" based on his perceptions of history, the realities of the military and the public's political consciousness. Baek Jong-wook, former third deputy director of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), and Kim Yong-bin, secretary-general of the National Election Commission (NEC), also testified later in the day. Baek and Kim were called to testify regarding the election fraud allegations, cited by Yoon as a main reason for declaring martial law.  When asked about such a possibility, Baek did not give a clear statement, saying it was ""not what we saw"" and his mission was confined to checking the ballot counting system.  Baek said the NIS had found that the NEC system had vulnerabilities and could have potentially been exposed to hacking during its 2023 inspection, but that should not be viewed in the same context as the alleged election fraud.  The court, meanwhile, rejected the request from Yoon's legal team to call Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and Lee Kyung-min, acting commander of the Defense Counterintelligence Command, to testify as witnesses, deeming it unnecessary. Yoon was impeached by the National Assembly in December on charges of inciting an insurrection through his short-lived imposition of martial law. The Constitutional Court has been reviewing whether to uphold the impeachment and remove him from office or dismiss the impeachment and reinstate him. Yoon is currently being held at a detention center ahead of a separate criminal trial on the insurrection charges. hague@yna.co.kr elly@yna.co.kr(END)","(3rd LD) Ex-interior minister denies trying to cut off power, water to media outlets after martial law declaration",Kim Seung-yeon,Yonhap News Agency,2025-02-11T21:34:57,2025-02-11T21:34:57,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/yemens-houthis-say-ready-to-launch-attacks-on-israel-if-gaza-ceasefire-collapses/,"Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis, who control most of western Yemen including the capital, are ready to launch attacks on Israel if it resumes attacks on Gaza and does not commit to the ceasefire deal, the group’s leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi said in a televised speech on Tuesday. “Our hands are on the trigger and we are ready to immediately escalate against the Israeli enemy if it returns to escalation in the Gaza Strip,” al-Houthi said. The announcement came the day after Palestinian terror group Hamas threw the truce into turmoil by saying it would pause fulfilling its commitments to the ceasefire deal reached last month, alleging Israeli violations. During the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis repeatedly fired ballistic missiles and drones at Israel, in what eventually became nearly daily assaults. While most were intercepted, the attacks sent millions scrambling to bomb shelters, often in the middle of the night. Some drones and rockets hit the country, killing a man in Tel Aviv on one occasion and causing extensive damage to a school on another, as well as other damage including in the southern resort city of Eilat. The Houthis also attacked Israeli and other vessels in the Red Sea, disturbing global shipping lanes, in what they said were acts of solidarity with Gaza’s Palestinians during Israel’s war with Hamas. Israel responded to the Houthi attacks with airstrikes on the terror group’s resources in Yemen. The US and Britain have also bombed the Houthis over their attacks on shipping. The Houthis had said that they would end their assaults when the war ended in Gaza, and since the start of the ceasefire have not attacked Israel. The Gaza war started on October 7, 2023, when Hamas led thousands of terrorists to invade southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. A complex three-phase ceasefire that began last month includes the gradual release of hostages in return for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, where it launched a ground campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the October 7 attack. With five rounds of hostage-prisoner releases completed in the ongoing Gaza ceasefire deal as of last Saturday, there are 17 Israeli hostages still supposed to be returned in the first phase, in exchange for hundreds more Palestinian security prisoners. However, on Monday, Hamas said that it intended to delay the next release of Israeli hostages, slated for Saturday, “until further notice,” in response to what it claimed were Israeli violations of the ongoing hostage-ceasefire deal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in recent days kept the door open to resuming fighting with Hamas rather than continuing to a second phase of the deal, while US President Donald Trump suggested that Israel issue an ultimatum to the terror group to return all the hostages by Saturday at noon. Netanyahu is under pressure from the far-right flank of his coalition to continue the war until Hamas is completely destroyed, a declared goal of the campaign. Seventy-three of the 251 people abducted by Hamas during its October 7 onslaught remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF.",Yemen’s Houthis say ready to launch attacks on Israel if Gaza ceasefire collapses,"Reuters, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-02-11T16:23:30,2025-02-11T16:23:30,gemini-2.0-flash

Ukraine launched a surprisecross-border incursioninto Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in anew offensive. The Ukrainian military continues to hold Russian territory that could play ""an important part"" infuture negotiations, Zelensky previously said. ""We will swap one territory for another,"" Zelensky toldThe Guardian, without specifying which Russian-occupied land Ukraine would seek in return. ""I don't know, we will see. But all our territories are important, there is no priority,"" he said. Talk of ending Russia'sfull-scale invasionof Ukraine has increased as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20.

According to sources in Ukraine's President's Office, cited byRBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after theMunich Security Conference. On Feb. 7, the U.S. president revealed he aims to meet Zelensky inWashingtonthe following week. He also recently said that the U.S. wants access to Ukraine'srare earth mineralsin exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners. Trump has alsoallegedlyspoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/un-says-staff-member-has-died-in-custody-of-yemens-houthi-rebels/,"The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) says that a staff member held captive by Houthi rebels in Yemen has died. “WFP is grief-stricken and outraged about the death of a staff member while in detention in northern Yemen,” the agency says in a statement on X. He was identified as a Yemeni staff member “arbitrarily detained by local authorities since 23 January,” though the circumstances of his death were not specified. The employee, who WFP said had worked for the UN since 2017, left behind a wife and two children. The United Nations announced the suspension Monday of its activities in Yemen’s Saada region, a Huthi stronghold, after the rebels detained multiple personnel there this year. The Iran-backed Houthi have arrested dozens of staffers from the UN and other humanitarian organizations, most of them since the middle of 2024, as Yemen’s decade-long civil war grinds on. In January alone, the rebels detained eight UN workers, including six in Saada, which adds to the dozens of NGO and UN personnel detained since June. The Houthi claimed the June arrests included “an American-Israeli spy network” operating under the cover of humanitarian organizations — allegations emphatically rejected by the UN Human Rights Office.

There were two pilots and two passengers on Neil’s plane, but he was not among them.“Mr. Neil’s thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting today,” Robinson said.The arriving jet veered off the runway and collided with the Gulfstream 200 jet that was parked on private property, according to Kelli Kuester, aviation planning and outreach coordinator at the Scottsdale Airport. It appeared that the left main landing gear of the arriving jet failed, resulting in the collision, she said.Kuester said four people were on the arriving jet, which had come from Austin, Texas, and one person was in the parked plane. Two people injured in the collision were taken to trauma centers and one was in stable condition at a hospital, Scottsdale Fire Department Capt. Dave Folio said. He said they were working to recover the body of the person killed in the collision.“Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody involved in this,” Folio said.The runway has been closed and will remain closed “for the foreseeable future,” Kuester said.Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowskysaid in a statement that she is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the airport, police and federal agencies.“On behalf of the city of Scottsdale, we offer our deepest condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have been taken to our trauma center for treatment,” she said. “We will keep all affected by this tragedy in our prayers.”The airport is a popular hub for jets coming in and out of the Phoenix area, especially during big sports weekends like the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament, which attracts huge crowds just a few miles away.The Scottsdale collision comes after three major U.S. aviation disasters in the past two weeks.

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-koreas-yoon-blames-malicious-opposition-for-martial-law-bid,"SEOUL - South Korea’s suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol blamed the “malicious” opposition for his decision to declare martial law, telling a court on Feb 11 that the opposition’s refusal to applaud him or shake his hand exposed its plans to “destroy” his government. The former prosecutor plunged democratic South Korea into political turmoil when he declared martial law on Dec 3, suspending civilian rule and sending soldiers to Parliament. The attempt lasted only six hours as the opposition-led Parliament defied troops to vote down the declaration, later impeaching him over the move. Mr Yoon was detained in mid-January on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested. He is regularly being transported from prison to hearings at the Constitutional Court, which will determine whether his impeachment is upheld. At the Feb 11 hearing, Mr Yoon complained that the South Korean opposition had failed to offer him due respect while he was in office. “No matter how much they dislike me, it is the basic principle of dialogue and compromise to listen to me and give me a round of applause for my budget speech in Parliament,” the 64-year-old told the court. But, he said, opposition lawmakers “didn’t even enter the main hall, and I had to give a speech to a half-empty Parliament”. Such a gesture, he claimed, was “deeply malicious” and exposed the “opposition’s intent to destroy my government”. He then complained that opposition MPs attending another Parliament address “turned their heads away... and refused to shake hands”. In his martial law declaration, Mr Yoon labelled the opposition “anti-state elements” intent on insurrection, saying the decree was required “to safeguard constitutional order”. The Feb 11 hearing is widely expected to be the last one before the court rules whether to uphold Mr Yoon’s impeachment, a move that would trigger a fresh presidential election within 60 days. Several lawmakers were in attendance at the hearing, an AFP reporter in court saw. Outside, Mr Yoon’s supporters held “Stop the Steal” signs. They have borrowed US President Donald Trump’s rhetoric to support unproven claims that recent South Korean elections – dominated by the opposition – were manipulated by shadowy foreign forces. One protester stood on top of a car, shouting into a microphone for Mr Yoon’s release. Much of Mr Yoon’s impeachment trial has centred on whether he violated the Constitution in declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war. Mr Yoon suggested last week that even if he had ordered the arrest of MPs to prevent them from voting down his decree, it would not legally matter because the order had not been carried out.

The assessment came after South Korea's spy agency earlier estimated the North to have sent some 11,000 troops to support Russia, of which 300 are believed to have been killed, with some 2,700 others wounded. ""(North Korea) has provided some 11,000 troops, missiles, 200 pieces of long-range artillery and a substantial amount of ammunition and there is the possibility of (the North) additionally supplying troops, weapons and ammunition going forward,"" the ministry said in a briefing to the parliamentary defense committee.

It raised the possibility of the North receiving Russia's technological assistance in exchange for military support, specifically mentioning technologies for nuclear-powered submarines and atmospheric re-entry technology for ICBMs. Regarding the North's relations with the United States, the ministry said Pyongyang appears to be seeking to establish favorable circumstances for talks with Washington through a display of tough rhetoric and provocations. The North has not responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's expression of his intent to reengage with leader Kim Jong-un.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-841593,"“Hamas is playing for time – and the hostages are their main survival card. Israel must respond decisively. Otherwise, we’ll find ourselves facing endless demands,” Yossi Amrosi, a former senior Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) official, lecturer on current affairs, and author, warned in an interview with	Maariv on Tuesday. Hamas claimed on Monday that Israel failed to meet several agreed-upon terms, including the number of aid trucks and fuel entering Gaza. However, Amrosi dismissed these as false claims. “Even the mediators themselves testify that Israel met all the established conditions – including the careful release of Palestinian terrorists and even the evacuation of the Netzarim corridor, which was one of the IDF’s greatest military achievements in the war.” Beyond the exchange of accusations, a crucial question emerges: why did Hamas choose this moment for such an ultimatum, and what strategic considerations lie behind it? Amrosi outlined several possible motivations, the foremost being Hamas’s growing confidence following recent developments. The organization’s strengthened position stems from various achievements on the ground. “Hamas sees itself as having achieved significant gains – Israel evacuated the Netzarim corridor, thousands of aid trucks are entering Gaza, the Rafah crossing has reopened, and there’s also Iranian backing, which intensified after Hamas leaders’ meetings in Tehran,” Amrosi noted. The move may also serve as a response to former US president Donald Trump’s plan for the US to take over the Gaza Strip. “Until now, Hamas has barely responded to the Palestinian relocation plan presented in the US, but they might now see an opportunity to declare: ‘We’re here, and we’re not going anywhere,’” Amrosi said. Furthermore, Hamas is likely considering Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s perceived reluctance to advance to the next phase of the war. “Hamas understands well the political pressure within Israel and the coalition’s opposition to continuing the war. It estimates Netanyahu won’t proceed to the next phase, so it’s trying to pressure him publicly through the families and the Israeli public,” he said. The strategy also reflects Hamas’s tactical need for time to rebuild and strengthen. “Hamas has a clear interest in extending negotiations as much as possible. For them, time is their most precious resource – and they use every minute to rehabilitate infrastructure, rebuild their forces, gather weapons, and prepare for the next round of fighting,” Amrosi said. Amrosi identified two main options for Israel. The first would be yielding to Hamas’s demands, which he warned would set a dangerous precedent. “The first option is to say, ‘Sorry, Hamas, you’re right,’ and fulfill their demands to advance the deal. This would be a strategic disaster that would lead to more ultimatums in the future.” The second option involves maintaining a firm stance while applying counterpressure. “Israel must clarify that it hasn’t violated any terms of the agreement and activate mediators – especially the US – to pressure Hamas to return to the original agreements. If this doesn’t work, it should present its own ultimatum: if the deal isn’t realized, fighting will resume with greater intensity.” In his concluding remarks, Amrosi emphasized that “Israel has enough tools to apply pressure – and it must use them. Hamas sees the hostages as their most important strategic weapon, and if we don’t make clear there’s a price for this, we’ll find ourselves facing endless delays. Hamas is counting on public pressure in Israel to overcome the government. The question is whether Israel will manage to break this pattern or continue to be dragged along by it.",Shin Bet veteran urges Israel: Don't cave to Hamas' hostage demands,PELED ARBELI,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-11T08:13:00,2025-02-11T08:40:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hostage-release-delay-ceasefire-violations-76d6fd9162160f9554fec37041342714,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Hamas said Monday it will delay the further release of hostages in the Gaza Strip after accusing Israel of violating a fragile ceasefire that now faces its most serious crisis since it began three weeks ago. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under heavy pressure to secure the release of remaining hostages after three Israelis freed Saturday came home emaciated after 16 months in captivity. Yet in a sign of the precarious nature of the truce, the Israeli military said late Monday it had canceled leave for soldiers assigned to Gaza. Hamas’ said its plan to delay the next hostage release “until further notice” depended on whether Israel “abides by its obligations.” The announcement came as Palestinians and the international community seethed over President Donald Trump’s recent comments that Palestinians from Gaza would not have a right to return under his proposal for the U.S. to take over the war-torn territory. In an effort to improve relations with the Trump administration, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday ended a controversial system that paid stipends to the families of Palestinian prisoners, including those convicted in deadly attacks on Israel. The U.S. and Israel have said the so-called “martyrs fund” rewarded violence against Israel. Israel and Hamas are in the midst of a six-week ceasefire during which Hamas has committed to releasing 33 hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The sides have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire’s first phase went into effect on Jan. 19, freeing 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners. The next exchange, scheduled for Saturday, called for three more Israeli hostages to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The war could resume in early March if no agreement is reached on the more complicated second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for the return of all remaining hostages and an indefinite extension of the truce. An Israeli official said Netanyahu was consulting security officials after the Hamas announcement. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Netanyahu also pushed forward a scheduled meeting of his Security Cabinet to Tuesday morning from later in the day. In addition to canceling leave for soldiers in Gaza, the Israeli military also said Monday it was bolstering defensive forces responsible for areas along the border with Gaza. A judge granted Netanyahu’s request to postpone his testimony in an ongoing corruption trial on Tuesday due to the security situation. Defense Minister Israel Katz said Hamas’ plan to delay the next release of hostages was “a complete violation” of the ceasefire agreement and that he instructed the Israeli military to be on the highest level of alert. The prime minister’s coordinator for hostages said the Israeli government intends to live up to its end of the agreement. Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida said on social media that Israel has obstructed key provisions of the ceasefire by not allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, carrying out strikes across the territory and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid. The group later put out a statement calling its planned postponement a “warning signal,” adding that “the door remains open for the exchange to proceed as planned if Israel abides by its obligations.” The group representing many of the families of hostages called on mediating countries to prevent the deal from collapsing. “Recent evidence from those released, as well as the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday, leaves no room for doubt — time is of the essence, and all hostages must be urgently rescued from this horrific situation,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. In Gaza, Palestinians fretted the possibility of the truce falling apart. “People are all afraid. Today, people have begun to stock up on supplies for fear that war will return again,” said Mohammad Yusuf of Khan Younis. “There is no safety, because any defect in the agreement leads to the return of war, and the threat of a return of war.” Trump made his latest comments about Gaza in an interview with FOX News set to air Monday, less than a week after he floated his plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it in “the Riviera of the Middle East.” He has also ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza, who claim the territory as part of a future homeland. The ceasefire previously hit a snag when an Israeli female civilian held hostage wasn’t released as early as planned, and Israel delayed the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza for two days. Negotiators were able to find a solution, and the hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was eventually released with two other hostages. Under the new system announced by Abbas, the Palestinian president, prisoners’ families will still be eligible for government assistance, but only depending on their financial needs. Previously, payments were determined based on the amount of time a prisoner had spent in prison. The system will also be transferred from the Palestinian government to an outside foundation. There was no immediate reaction from the U.S. or Israel. During Trump’s first term, the U.S. halted assistance to the Palestinian Authority because of the martyr’s fund. Israel has withheld hundreds of millions of dollars of tax transfers to the cash-strapped authority because of the policy. A senior Palestinian official said the Palestinians have informed the Trump administration of the decision and hope the U.S. legislation cutting assistance, known as the Taylor Force Act, will be rescinded and that Israel will unfreeze the transfers. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing internal deliberations. Hamas condemned the Palestinian Authority’s move, calling it “an unpatriotic move that violates one of our core national principles.” ___ Associated Press writer Samy Magdy contributed from Cairo.","Hamas says it will delay the release of more hostages, putting Gaza ceasefire at risk","MELANIE LIDMAN, SAMY MAGDY",AP News,2025-02-10T16:21:12,2025-02-11T04:08:58,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/australia-albanese-trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum-354d8596ec3b37100b5c0fd811c67bcf,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump said he agreed to consider a tariff exemption on Australian steel and aluminum imports after a telephone call on Tuesday with Australia’s prime minister. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese argued for an exemption during the call, which was scheduled before Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday. Trump said the United States trade surplus with Australia was one of the reasons he was considering an exemption from the tariffs. “We actually have a surplus,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about trade with Australia. “It’s one of the only countries which we do. And I told (Albanese) that that’s something that we’ll give great consideration to.” Trump spoke after he removed exceptions and exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%. Trump also hiked his 2018 aluminum tariffs to 25% from 10%. Albanese had told reporters earlier in Canberra he made Australia’s case for an exemption, and that both leaders agreed on wording to say publicly, “which is that the ‘U.S. president agreed that an exemption was under consideration in the interests of both of our countries.’” “They are the words that are agreed. They’re the words that I’ll stick to. And I can say, though, that it was a very positive and constructive discussion,” Albanese added. Australia had an exemption from such tariffs during Trump’s first administration. Australia’s arguments include that the country has run a trade deficit with the U.S. since the mid-20th century and Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S. Australia has only a minor share of the U.S. markets. Albanese on Tuesday also raised the AUKUS agreement with the U.S. and Britain, struck with former President Joe Biden’s administration, in which Australia will acquire a fleet of submarines powered by U.S. nuclear technology. “Our steel and aluminum are both key inputs for the U.S.-Australia defense industries in both of our countries,” Albanese said. Australia announced over the weekend it had made the first of six $500 million payments to the U.S. under AUKUS to boost U.S. submarine building capacity. Trump intends to reset U.S. taxes on all imports to match the same levels charged by other countries, all of which comes on top of the 10% tariffs he has already put on China, China’s retaliatory tariffs that started Monday and the U.S. tariffs planned for Canada and Mexico that have been suspended until March 1. Tuesday’s conversation was Albanese’s second with Trump since the president was elected. Albanese said after the phone call the “relationship is in good shape.”",Trump says he is considering tariff exemptions on Australian steel and aluminum,ROD MCGUIRK,AP News,2025-02-11T00:32:10,2025-02-11T04:42:58,gemini-2.0-flash

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-modi-trump-meet-india-backs-chabahar-port/articleshow/118126924.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the Trump administration threatens to roll back the sanction waiver that allowed India to develop the strategic Chabahar port in Iran, the Indian government Monday strongly backed the port saying it has provided a much-needed alternative route to Afghanistan for its reconstruction and economic development, while boosting trade linkages with Central Asia. The remarks by a senior MEA official follow the US restoration last week of its “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran to deny it all paths to a nuclear weapon and to counter its “malign influence” abroad. It saw US President Donald Trump signing a memorandum that calls upon the Secretary of State to modify or rescind sanction waivers, particularly those that provide Iran “any degree of economic or financial relief, including those related to Iran’s Chabahar port project”. The remarks - at an event to mark the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution of Iran – also came days before PM Narendra Modi’s bilateral meeting with Trump in Washington on Thursday. ""Regional connectivity has been an important pillar of India, Iran relations. The development of the Chabahar port in southeastern Iran reflects our joint vision for connectivity for mutual benefits,"" said MEA secretary (east) Jaideep Mazumdar, while describing the signing of the long-term contract for the development of Chabahar port in May last year as a significant milestone in India-Iran ties. The port has proven its strong potential. It has emerged as the connecting point for the region in delivering deliver humanitarian assistance, especially during the Covid pandemic, added the official, while listing the amount of assistance delivered to Afghanistan through the port. India and Iran had in 2015 signed an MoU to facilitate India’s partnership in developing the port. Last year, the 2 sides signed a contract that will have India equipping and operating the Shahid Beheshti terminal of the port over the next 10 years. The port opens up opportunities for India in trade and commerce with Afghanistan and Central Asia, while providing an alternative and reliable access route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan. As the Indian government maintains, the port’s location in Arabian Sea means it won’t be vulnerable to dangers posed by developments in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz. The previous Trump administration had in 2018 exempted Chabahar from US sanctions, acknowledging its role in facilitating reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. The memorandum also called upon the Secretary of State to modify or rescind existing sanctions waivers and cooperate with the Secretary of Treasury to implement a campaign aimed at driving Iran’s oil exports to zero. India has not been importing crude from Iran for many years now. ""Our economic ties are growing in many fields. Last year, Iran and India signed a long-term agreement to run the Chabahar port, known as the ""golden gateway"" to connect nations along the Indian Ocean with Central Asia and the Caucasus. Cooperation through the International North–South Transport Corridor is another key example of the strong partnership between our countries,"" said Iranian ambassador Iraj Elahi, speaking on the occasion.","Ahead of Modi-Trump meet, India backs Chabahar port",Sachin Parashar,Times Of India,2025-02-11T01:05:00,2025-02-11T01:05:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/france-emmanuel-macron-marine-le-pen-elections-court-national-rally-europe/,"PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has picked one of his closest allies to lead France’s highest constitutional authority, just weeks before it is slated to rule on a case likely to impact Marine Le Pen’s political future. The appointment of Richard Ferrand to serve as president of the Conseil Constitutionnel was announced Monday evening in a short statement that went out as Macron welcomed world leaders and tech moguls for the first day of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris. Ferrand’s selection had been an open secret for several days, has been met with widespread criticism from the president’s political opponents and raised eyebrows among legal and constitutional scholars. Several prominent voices argued that Ferrand’s prestigious appointment could politicize an independent institution at the heart of French democracy, especially as it gets ready to render a decision that could impact the far-right leader’s ability to stand in future elections. Benjamin Morel, a constitutional law professor at one of France’s leading law schools, said Ferrand’s presidency could cast a shadow over the institution’s decision, given his “political weight and his closeness to the head of state.” Le Pen was charged with having participated in a scheme to embezzle European Parliament funds to pay for domestic staff for her party, the National Rally. Prosecutors have asked that the far-right leader, one of the current front-runners for the next presidential election in 2027, be banned from running for public office over the next five years and that the sentence be immediately executed — even if she appeals. Typically in France punishments are suspended until the appeals process has concluded. Le Pen has repeatedly professed her innocence and claimed that her trial was “politicized.” In the weeks to come and in all likelihood before Le Pen’s verdict date, set for March 31, the Conseil Constitutionnel will, in relation to a separate case, rule on whether enforcing an ineligibility ruling before a defendant has exhausted their appeals undermines the constitutionally guaranteed right of voters to freely choose their representatives.  “If Ferrand announces a decision which in any way affects Le Pen’s ability to run in the next election, there’s a risk it will be perceived as a disguised coup,” Morel added. One of Macron’s BFFs The role of the Conseil Constitutionnel is similar to constitutional courts in other countries. It reviews legislation, oversees elections and rules on constitutional challenges. But unlike Germany’s BVerfG or the United States’ Supreme Court, you don’t need to be a trained judge or lawyer to be appointed. Ferrand isn’t a judge, but the former head of the French National Assembly and one of Macron’s earliest supporters.  Like Ferrand, both the outgoing president of the Conseil Constitutionnel, Laurent Fabius, and his predecessor Jean-Louis Debré, had previously presided over the National Assembly. Fabius and Debré were both politically aligned with the presidents who appointed them as well. But Debré was appointed by former President Jacques Chirac when he was just weeks away from leaving office and thus didn’t stand to benefit from Debré’s new role. Fabius, meanwhile, had not historically been close to the president who appointed him, François Hollande. Constitutional experts like Morel believe Ferrand’s ties to the president are much more worrying than those who had the job before him, and they have pointed to a legal principle according to which institutions, particularly courts, must not only be impartial but also appear impartial to the public. Writing in Le Figaro, the Conseil’s former secretary-general, Jean-Éric Schoettl, said that its leader “must be beyond any suspicion of partisanship, favoritism, or personal ties.” Macron’s political opponents have seized on the controversy. Member of the European Parliament Marion Maréchal, Le Pen’s niece and a National Rally ally, said in an interview on RTL Ferrand’s appointment was an attempt to hinder Le Pen’s capacity to lead reforms if she is elected president. The Democratic and Republican group in the National Assembly — made up of communist lawmakers and representatives from France’s territories outside Europe — said it would reintroduce a bill to require all members of the Conseil Constitutionnel to have legal experience and skills and not have been in government or parliament in the decade preceding their appointment. A change to the system is backed by many French legal scholars, said Julien Bonnet, a constitutional law professor at the University of Montpellier and head of the French Constitutional Law Association.   “With the current appointment system, a decision can be perfectly sound from a legal perspective, but read as being political by public opinion or media,” Bonnet said. Ferrand’s final hurdle will be approval by the law committees of both houses of the French parliament, the Senate and the National Assembly. To block his nomination, three-fifths of the combined committee members would need to oppose it — an outcome that, at this stage, appears unlikely.",Macron picks close ally to lead court that could decide Le Pen’s fate,Victor Goury-Laffont,POLITICO,2025-02-10T18:50:43,2025-02-11T08:44:26,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/moldova-russia-backed-breakaway-region-strikes-deal-end-energy-crisis-transnistria/,"Moldova has reached a deal with its Russian-backed breakaway Transnistria region to get gas flowing again after Moscow cut off supplies last month, having left hundreds of thousands of people without heating or water. In a statement Monday, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said Transnistria had declined €60 million in European Union funds to help with fuel deliveries and instead brokered a deal with a Hungarian firm. Transnistrian authorities claimed it will be underpinned by ""Russian credit."" ""Under Moscow’s pressure, [Transnistria's de facto capital] Tiraspol refused €60 million in EU aid that could have ended energy blackmail,"" Recean wrote online. A senior Moldovan government official confirmed the details to POLITICO. ""Russia blocked the EU-proposed solution for the Transnistrian region"" over fears of losing its hold over the unrecognized state,"" added the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the arrangement. Moscow has historically provided free gas to the separatist authorities, allowing them to fund pensions and soldiers' salaries through energy sales. However, a plan to secure alternatives with the support of the EU would have meant tariffs gradually increasing and integration with the continent's energy markets. ""If the Transnistrian region moves toward market prices, it weakens Russia's grip — eliminating the need for subsidized energy and eroding Moscow’s economic leverage in the region,"" the official said. ""By obstructing this transition, Russia is protecting its most powerful tools of influence."" The humanitarian crisis began at the start of the year when Moscow ended gas flows to the area over a dispute with the Moldovan government.

""The army and people of [North Korea] will invariably support and encourage the just cause of the Russian Army and people to defend their sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity in keeping with the spirit of the treaty on the comprehensive strategic partnership between [North Korea] and Russia,"" Kim was quoted by state media as saying. Western leaders and Ukrainian officials say North Korea has since last fall sent an estimated 11,000 troops to fight alongside of Kremlin troops, mainly in the Russian region of Kursk. Their current status is uncertain, with some intelligence sources saying many of the troops have been rotated out of the front lines after sufferinghorrific lossesin fighting against Ukrainian forces. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 8 said Russia's ""cooperation with North Korea will continue to expand."" Zelenskyy has publicly accused Russia and North Korea of trying to cover up evidence of the deployments by issuing fake papers to North Korean soldiers identifying them as Russian citizens. The Kremlin and Pyongyang have not commented directly on the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia or the reported high losses. Kim, speaking at the Defense Ministry to mark the countryâ	ms Army Day, also threatened to build up his nuclear forces and use other ""countermeasures"" as he blasted the military cooperation between the United States, South Korea, and Japan. Pyongyang ""does not want unnecessary tension of the regional situation but will take sustained countermeasures to ensure the regional military balance,"" Kim said. Kim said U.S. involvement in the region -- including deployment of nuclear assets, war maneuvers, and ties to the Japanese and South Korean militaries -- would lead to a military imbalance in the region and endanger the security situation, state-run KCNA reported. The report said Kim ""clarified once again the unshakable policy of more highly developing the nuclear forces"" after U.S. President Donald Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House on February 7 and expressed concerns about North Korea's nuclear program. North Korean state media assailed South Korea's recent military activity with the United States and warned that any aggressive action would be met forcefully.

https://www.rferl.org/a/kosovo-elections-albin-kurti-serbia/33307113.html,"For Kosovo, the February 9 parliamentary elections are about much more than just choosing a new government; they will shape the country’s diplomatic future, regional stability, and international standing. And, according to experts in the United States and the EU, the stakes are high -- without alignment with its international allies, Kosovo risks not only diplomatic friction but also potential isolation or even a frozen conflict. Kosovo's relations with Washington and Brussels are centered around the EU-facilitated dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo, which began in 2011 and aims to normalize relations between the two countries. Kurti Takes A Hard Line Since Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence, which Serbia still rejects, there have been ongoing tensions between the two countries. These tensions primarily revolve around ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo, who reject Pristina's authority and have tried to maintain parallel governance structures with Belgrade's support. Analysis: Kosovo Further Alienates Minority Serbs, Straining Status As 'Reliable Partner' Over the past 2 1 years, the government of Prime Minister Albin Kurti -- which is likely to win reelection -- has taken a hard line, replacing Serbian license plates with Kosovar ones, stopping the import of the Serbian currency to Kosovo, and closing Serbian banks and dozens of parallel institutions. Kurti's moves have been criticized by the previous U.S. administration and the EU, who argued that they were not coordinated with Kosovo's international partners and have made life harder for the country's ethnic Serbs. Richard Grenell, who served as special envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo talks in U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration, wrote on Xthat the ""Kurti Government was not trustworthy during Trump's first term, nor during Biden's term."" According to Grenell, both ""Republicans and Democrats have criticized Kurti consistently for taking unilateral actions that destabilize the region."" Richard Grenell (file photo) Kurti, however, has stuck to his guns, even when warned by the United States or when, in June 2023, the EU suspended financial aid to the country worth up to 100 million euros ($104 million). The moves against Kosovo's ethnic Serb community, Kurti has said, were necessary steps aimed at extending the rule of law in the north of the country, where most of Kosovo's ethnic Serbs live, and in line with the country's constitution. Moreover, on February 2, he said that no Kosovar government has had better relations with the United States than his own. Kosovo Village Celebrates Trump's Inauguration Kosovo’s elections will also shape its relationship with the EU, which is closely tied to its diplomatic stance toward Serbia. Kosovo’s EU application, which was submitted in December 2022, has been stalled ever since, as it needs a consensus of support among the 27 members of the EU. The biggest hurdle is the five EU countries -- Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain -- that do not recognize Kosovo's independence. Toby Vogel, a Western Balkans analyst at the Berlin-based Democratization Policy Council, told RFE that Kosovo's next government will need to work more diligently to improve relations with the EU. There is also the question of Kosovo's membership in international organizations, such as Interpol or the Council of Europe. While the EU has promised backing for Pristina to join these bodies, Serbian efforts to counteract have always succeeded. Will Kurti Change? Kurti's ruling Self-Determination Movement (LVV) is currently the favorite to win the elections, although most polls are predicting the party won't reach the 50 percent needed to form a government on its own. And, so far, Kurti has shown little sign that he is ready to change his policy toward Serbia and the West. The Kosovar government has continued to take a hard line by continuing to close institutions in the country tied to Serbia. And Kurti has signaled that, if he wins a new mandate as prime minister, he will continue to strengthen his image as an uncompromising leader who prioritizes principle over diplomacy. Kosovo Raids Parallel Serb Institutions Amid Simmering Ethnic Tensions ""The Republic of Kosovo, with our government in charge, will never say yes to the 'Association,'"" Kurti said at a rally with supporters in South Mitrovica on February 1. The association Kurti was referring is the Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities in Kosovo, which was part of an agreement Kosovo reached with Serbia in 2013 but has never been implemented. A huge sticking point between Serbia and Kosovo, the association is intended to coordinate Serb-majority municipalities in areas such as education, health care, and economic development. If Kurti wins and sticks to his guns, it could mean Kosovo is more isolated than ever. This, Vogel suggested, could mean occasional violence or a frozen conflict, ""like the one that's developed in Cyprus...over the years."" ""That would be a real problem for Kosovo,"" he said, ""because that would make it impossible for the country to move on."" Opposition Win Could Bring Significant Change There is also the possibility that Kurti would lose. If the LVV receives less than 50 percent but still receives the most votes, Kurti could try to form a coalition government. If he isn't successful, then the second-placed party would have a mandate to form a government. An opposition coalition could drastically redefine Kosovo's relations with the West -- and potentially reset peace talks with Serbia. Kurti's opponents for the prime minister's post have advocated repairing and deepening relations with the United States, which they argue, are essential for Kosovo’s future. Charles Kupchan, from the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, said that whoever forms the next government in Kosovo must ensure that relations with Washington remain strong and intact. Kosovo, he said, cannot afford to be at odds with its allies. ""I would say, if you want a good relationship with the United States, make deals, get into the bazaar, be ready to negotiate,"" Kupchan said. ""And I think that actions that are seen as causing difficulty will not go over well in Washington. Actions that are seen [as] advancing the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia will be greeted warmly in Washington.""",Why Kosovo's Election Matters For The Region And The World,"Valona Tela, Rikard Jozwiak",RFE/RL,2025-02-08T18:03:22,2025-02-09T08:31:43,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.rferl.org/a/scholz-merz-germany-elections-taurus-russia-ukraine/33309168.html,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz again ruled out sending long-range Taurus missilesto Ukraine, opposing actions that would ""deliver destructive weapons"" deep inside of Russia, and hitting out at his conservative political rival, who has expressed more openness to delivering such weapons to Kyiv. ""I do not think it is right to deliver destructive weapons deep into the Russian hinterland,"" Scholz said on February 9 during a 90-minute televised debate ahead of national elections in two weeks. ""That is, I believe, exactly the kind of step not to make if you carry responsibility for Germany,"" he added. Friedrich Merz, whose conservative CDU alliance is leading in the polls against Scholzâ	ms center-left SPD, said he has ""always been very clear"" regarding his position on sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine. ""I have always said the delivery of cruise missiles must be decided in the European Union. The United States delivers, France delivers, Britain delivers; we should also have delivered,"" Merz said. Merz told German media in October that he would approve delivery to Kyiv of the missiles -- which have a range of some 500 kilometers -- under certain conditions. If Russian strikes on Ukraine ""don't stop, then the first step is this: Lift the range restriction [on current Ukraine missile launchings]. And the second step is that we deliver the Taurus,"" he said. That way, he added, Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has it in his hands how far he wants to escalate this war further."" Germany's DW reported in July that Merz spoke in favor of Berlin aiding Kyiv to protect against Russian aggression and supply it with combat aircraft. ""I believe that we should help Ukraine at least restore sovereignty over its own airspace,"" he wasquoted as saying. Although Scholz has been reluctant to send Kyiv heavy weaponry, Berlin trails only Washington in the amount of support provided to Ukraine.Scholz has insistedthat it is essential to secure the ""sovereignty of Ukraine and [ensure] that it will not be forced to submit to a dictated peace."" In November,Scholz attackedthe final declaration of theG20 summitin Rio de Janeiro for not plainly stating that Russia was responsible for the war in Ukraine, even as he restated his opposition to sending long-range missiles to Kyiv. ""In my view, supplying cruise missiles would be a mistake for many reasons,"" he said at the time -- including the danger that it would bring Germany closer to direct conflict with Russia. Domestically, Scholz, seeking a bounce-back in the polls ahead of the February 23 election, accused Merz of seeking support from the far-right Alternative for Deutschland (Germany) or AfD, which would break the taboo against the mainstream parties in the country cooperating with the party. Following World War II, Germany has done ""very well in the past decades when the democratic parties agreed not to cooperate with the extreme right,"" Scholz said. Merz underlined that his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Bavarian CSU allies would not cooperate or rule with the virulently anti-immigration AfD. ""I want to make it clear here once again that we will not do that,"" Merz said. â	œThere are no similarities between the AfD and the [CDU]."" The CDU alliance, which is polling at about 30 percent, has itself pressed for tougher immigration policies in an effort to draw voters away from the AfD, which is polling at around 20 percent. Scholz said Merz's proposal to reject all migrants at Germany's borders ""contradicts European law."" Scholzâ	ms Social Democrats and the Greens each are at around 15-18 percent support ahead of the vote for the next parliament, or Bundestag. ING bank analyst Carsten Brzeski wrote that the debate likely ended in a draw and -- though heated at times -- was relatively ""well-behaved,"" which could leave open the possibility of a ""grand coalition"" involving the CDU and other groups in an effort to shut out the AfD, which has been accused of having ties to Russia. Initial public opinion polls also scored the two politicians' performances in the debate as roughly equal. Scholz and Merz are scheduled to meet again in a head-to-head debate on February 19. They are also scheduled meet in a four-way debate on February 16 with AfD's Alice Weidel and Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck from the Greens.

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-commission-expanding-definition-defense-spending/,"BRUSSELS — European Union governments will be able to increase military spending without falling foul of the bloc’s budget rules under plans to expand what can be classed as defense investment. The costs of military staffing and equipment maintenance — which currently count toward a country’s deficit figures that are strictly policed by the European Commission — could be considered alongside core defense spending, four officials, three from national governments and one from the EU, told POLITICO. Europe is desperately searching for ways to fund its defense needs as the war in Ukraine enters its fourth year and United States President Donald Trump demands the hiking of defense spending to 5 percent of gross domestic product. The EU’s spending rules aim to keep national budget deficits — the amount governments spend relative to what they bring in — at less than 3 percent of the size of the economy and public debt at no more than 60 percent.But countries can be granted more time to get to these levels if they invest in defense. They can also escape a punitive measure — known as an excessive deficit procedure — if their extra spending is related to defense. The proposed broader definition — which is still just one option under consideration — would be a gift for countries with overstretched budgets, such as Italy with its debt mountain or eternally overspending France; and governments like Poland, which is under Commission monitoring for an excessive deficit despite spending heavily on defense. The plan is to include in the definition “all increased investment like manpower or maintenance of new equipment — not only purchases of equipment,” said one of the officials who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to talk about confidential discussions. Expanding the definition of defense spending is the second piece of the “extraordinary measures” to boost the bloc’s military capacity that Commission President Ursula von der Leyen floated in her meeting with EU leaders on Monday, as POLITICO revealed. The first was an emergency clause that countries could trigger in the case of events beyond their control, which would allow them to deviate from previously agreed fiscal paths. Fiscally conservative states led by Germany opposed this option during a meeting of EU treasury chiefs last week. There are lingering concerns, however, that merely expanding the definition of defense won’t be enough for highly indebted government such as Italy, Spain and France to increase their defense budget without making cuts elsewhere. A decision on the options under consideration should be made relatively soon, according to the EU official. Creative solutions In light of past financial crises, the Commission sees its reformed fiscal rules — which entered into force just one year ago, but have been labeled as too strict by countries such as Italy and Poland — as sacrosanct. But it is also trying to find creative solutions to allow for more flexibility.  Officials from European finance ministries have been working with the Commission’s economic department on the issue for some time, several EU diplomats told POLITICO.  The unexpected move from von der Leyen last Monday has accelerated that ongoing work. However, while the proposal risks triggering a debate on what kind of defense investment the bloc needs, it is also seen as one of the few viable options to dovetail the EU’s targets. A senior EU diplomat said it is a way to give “relief” to other countries in light of Germany’s resistance to more creative roads to increase EU defense spending, referring to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s opposition to issuing eurobonds for defense. Eastern and Southern European countries, plus France, “can work” to support changes the Commission is considering, the diplomat said. “Eastern countries stress how preparedness is important, and that means expenses for transporting troops and being ready for military mobilization.” UPDATED: This article has been updated to clarify the timing of the EU treasury chiefs' meeting.",EU considers giving countries wiggle room to boost defense spending,"Giovanna Faggionato, Gregorio Sorgi",POLITICO,2025-02-10T03:27:42Z,2025-02-12T12:45:12Z,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-841347,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene the Israeli security cabinet on Tuesday to discuss the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal after an Israeli delegation arrived in Qatar on Sunday for more Gaza truce talks. The cabinet meeting was scheduled following criticism from the Israeli public and opposition figures over it not being carried out earlier despite the ceasefire agreement explicitly stating that talks between Israel and Hamas would begin on the ceasefire’s 16th day.“The security cabinet is scheduled for Tuesday – because they have time,” opposition head and Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid wrote on X “We saw the hostages on Saturday. They are dying there of hunger and cold, but this government has no urgency and does not care.”Many officials believe that reaching an agreement on phase two with Hamas could be more difficult to achieve than phase one, noting that Netanyahu had previously stated he would refuse Hamas’s demand for a full stop to the war during the second phase.US President Donald Trump said last week that he supports the destruction of Hamas, which “doesn’t make things easier,” an official told the Jerusalem Post.Washington, Qatar, and Egypt mediated the ceasefire, which has largely held. In keeping with the deal, on Sunday, the IDF completed its withdrawal from its remaining positions in the Netzarim Corridor, which bisects Gaza.Israeli delegation arrives in DohaAn Israeli delegation arrived in Doha on Sunday for talks with mediators. However, the delegation's mandate over the deal will be extremely limited, said one Israeli official. The delegation, which includes Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch, as well as a senior Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) official, referred to as “M,” will only discuss the current phase of the hostage deal and will not negotiate over the second phase.Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, announced “the beginning of the phase two talks” after meeting Netanyahu and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani at Mar-a-Lago last week.According to Israeli and other senior officials who recently met with Witkoff, the impression is that despite the hurdles faced by the relevant parties, the Trump administration is still intent on moving forward with phase two of the Gaza deal.President Isaac Herzog said on Sunday that Trump was set to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and possibly Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, although he gave no dates for the talks.The comments, delivered in an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, came in response to a question about Trump’s recently unveiled proposal to take over and redevelop the Gaza Strip.Herzog did not say when or where the meetings would take place, nor did he discuss their potential content.

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/europe-can-act-within-an-hour-if-us-levies-tariffs-germanys-scholz,"BERLIN – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Feb 10 labelled as “a scandal” US President Donald Trump’s plans for the war-ravaged Palestinian territory of Gaza. Mr Trump sparked global outrage by suggesting on Feb 4 that Washington should take control of the Gaza Strip, clear out its inhabitants and turn it into “the Riviera of the Middle East”. Mr Scholz, speaking in a pre-election TV debate, branded the plan “a scandal” and said “the relocation of a population is unacceptable and against international law”. His conservative election rival Friedrich Merz said: “I share this assessment.” But Mr Merz added that Mr Trump’s announcement is “part of a whole series of proposals coming from the American government”. “We have to wait and see what is really meant seriously and how it will be implemented. There is probably a lot of rhetoric involved.” Israel launched a devastating military offensive against Hamas in Gaza in response to the Palestinian militant group’s Oct 7, 2023, attack which began the war. That conflict has devastated much of the Gaza Strip – a narrow coastal territory on the eastern Mediterranean – but a ceasefire since January has brought a halt to the deadly conflict and provides for the release of hostages seized by Hamas.

https://www.politico.eu/article/the-15-days-that-upended-emmanuel-macron-vision-for-european-ai/,"PARIS — The conversation around the table was free-flowing but anxious. It was mid-January, and the cream of France’s tech industry was lunching with Emmanuel Macron in the elegant Salon des Ambassadeurs at the Elysée Palace. Mistral boss Arthur Mensch, Helsing chief Antoine Bordes and billionaire entrepreneur Xavier Niel were all there. As some of the attendees struggled with the cutlery and French dining etiquette, the tech bros all had one message for the French president: The battle to become the world’s leader in artificial intelligence was raging and Europe risked losing out. Little did they know how prescient their warning would prove. A week later, U.S. President Donald Trump upended the tech industry with his Stargate plan, a staggering $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure. The Jan. 21 announcement sent shockwaves through Paris and across the continent. “It knocked everyone out ... You felt suddenly a gloominess descend, with people saying we’ll never be able to raise so much money,” said Laure de Roucy-Rochegonde, an AI expert with the Paris-based IFRI think tank. It was felt then that the U.S. was about to annihilate the competition. Even if American investors failed to raise the full $500 billion, even a fifth of that sum dwarfed anything Europe could aspire to spend. Macron’s pet project, the AI Action Summit in Paris, was less than a month away and risked coming off like a two-bit side event. Its goals — to push for sustainability and inclusivity — now appeared almost quaint. But by the weekend, another groundbreaking moment had whiplashed the tech world. Chinese startup DeepSeek reported that its cutting-edge chatbot had been built at a fraction of the cost of competitors like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, sending investors scrambling and reviving hopes that the global AI race wouldn’t simply be won by whoever was willing to spend the most. “[The U.S.] use brute force with lots of resources, graphic processing units and data centers ... but the Chinese did better. In the end that’s how innovation works, first someone storms the fortress with sheer force, then someone else enters by a back door,” said Justin Vaïsse, head of the Paris Peace Forum, the nonprofit that helped organize the AI summit in Paris. “It’s just a shame it wasn’t the Europeans who found that back door,” he added. Europe first Macron’s international summit, which begins Monday and will draw high-level envoys like U.S. Vice President JD Vance, India’s Narendra Modi and Ding Xuexiang, the Chinese vice-prime minister, was initially billed as an opportunity to push for more accessible AI technology. “As often with big upheavals, we missed the turning point. That’s what happened with robotization and social networks,” said an aide to the French president, who, like others quoted in this story, was granted anonymity for protocol reasons. The aide said that France must respond by securing “the place of France and Europe” in the new world of AI. The late-January emotional rollercoaster preceding the summit put Paris into fight mode. Now the event is more about showcasing what Europe can do and supporting the continent’s burgeoning AI sector. The summit has since become, in the words of one European official, “a Cannes festival” of the continent’s startups. It’s also an opportunity to get European investors to support their local AI companies, Macron said last week during a videoconference alongside the European Union’s technology sovereignty commissioner, Henna Virkkunen. The president’s message was one of “European preference,” said a French government official. “We are not going to control what companies do, but European patriotism is at stake.” Incentives to “buy European,” a data bank with preferential rates for local companies, and more EU grants are some of the ideas being bounced around in the French capital to save the continent’s AI industry. But that’s just the type of initiative that will have industry veterans rolling their eyes. Chinese startup DeepSeek reported that its cutting-edge chatbot was built at a fraction of the cost of competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT. | Mladen Antonov Images “This is what France does every time there’s a new technology,” said Michael Jackson, an American tech investor who lives in Paris, noting the demise of European champions such as the Qwant search engine and Gaia-X cloud computing. A wakeup call For Emmanuel Macron, artificial intelligence and technology on the whole have long been  strategic domains. The French president promised to create “a startup nation” when he was elected in 2017, and soon ordered an AI action plan from Fields Medal Winner Cédric Villani. Macron has also long championed Mistral, the crown jewel of the French AI industry, one of the few companies on the continent that develops the technology behind conversational chatbots. Macron secured a win on Thursday when the United Arab Emirates agreed to spend more than €30 billion in France to build a 1 gigawatt data center in France. One of Macron's advisers called the investment “proof of France’s attractiveness.",The 15 days that upended Macron’s vision for European AI,Clea Caulcutt,POLITICO,2025-02-06T05:00:00Z,2025-02-07T13:07:49Z,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/australia-close-to-breaking-china-s-critical-mineral-stranglehold-20250205-p5l9ox.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_business,"Australian firms are edging closer to breaking China’s production stranglehold on the rare minerals used in the world’s critical defence systems, electric vehicles and clean energy transition. Companies like Iluka Resources, Lynas Rare Earths, and several lithium miners are already refining, or close to producing, the minerals needed for the batteries, electric circuitry and high-strength magnets that underpin the globe’s green energy transition. Light rare earth oxides, such as neodymium and praseodymium, are used in aircraft engines, electronics, wind turbines and electric vehicles. Heavy rare earths, like the dysprosium and terbium over which China has a stranglehold, are a crucial element in the permanent high-strength magnets used in robotics, defence technology and ocean wind turbines, where they require little maintenance to generate electricity far from the coastline. The minerals refined by Australian companies are now a strategic asset as America swings sharply towards a more transactional trade stance under US President Donald Trump, and Beijing counters US tariffs by clamping down on supply of scarce metals. If Australia is dragged into a trade war with the US and China, “heavy rare earths could serve as a bargaining chip,” said Neha Mukherjee, a senior analyst in rare earths at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Within hours of Trump imposing a 10 per cent tariff on China last week, Beijing introduced export controls on a raft of key minerals such as tungsten, tellurium, molybdenum, bismuth and indium that are critical to a range of high-tech goods. China’s Commerce Ministry said the controls were to “safeguard national security interests.” The clampdown exposes a fault line running through the global economy. China has invested heavily for decades in refining production of critical minerals and rare earths and accounts for 90 per cent of all rare earth oxides used in global manufacturing, effectively controlling all supply of key heavy rare earths. Governments around the world are scrambling to secure supplies of the key minerals as a result. “Rare earths are among very few metals where China has demonstrated a preparedness to withhold supply to achieve unrelated political or other objectives. We’ve also seen China previously implement restrictions on the export of rare earth processing technology,” Iluka managing director Tom O’Leary said. “We’ve all seen the perils of concentrated supply chain over the last several years, and so there’s much greater awareness now of the importance of security of supply,” O’Leary said. Iluka is building a fully integrated rare earths refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia with the help of a $1.65 billion federal government loan. Within a decade of firing up the plant in 2027, it will account for 10 per cent of the world’s rare earth oxide supply and refine more than a third of the globe’s strategically important heavy rare earth oxides, the company says. Meanwhile, ASX-listed Lynas – valued at $6.5 billion – late last year turned on production at its newly built $800 million mixed rare-earth processing plant in Kalgoorlie. It will ship the carbonate output from Kalgoorlie for further refining in Malaysia where it operates the world’s largest single rare earths processing plant producing separated rare earths for export. Lynas is also building a heavy rare earths refinery in Texas, backed by $384 million in Defence Department funding from the Biden administration, in a bid to accelerate America’s access to supplies of rare earths. Another Benchmark analyst, Cameron Perks, said if the US-China trade war escalates, combined with new tariffs and export controls, it’s going to have a significant impact on the critical minerals sector as a whole. “We’re seeing critical minerals being used more and more as bargaining chips in trade negotiations, with countries leveraging their control over supply chains to get a better deal,” Perks said. “Clients in South Korea and Japan have been reaching out to Australia a lot lately, wanting insights on supply, demand, pricing, and cost curves as they try to figure out the impact of Trump’s policies. They’re trying to figure out if this is an opportunity or if they should be backing out,” he said. Australia’s current heavy rare earth output accounts for just 1 per cent of global mined production, Mukherjee said. But it’s projected to jump significantly, reaching 14 per cent by 2029 – the fastest growth outside of China. Ramping up refining capacity is costly, technically challenging and time-consuming. Few have gained the foothold required to compete with China, even on more basic materials like lithium. ASX-listed IGO began producing battery-grade lithium hydroxide with joint venture partner China’s Tianqi Lithium from its Kwinana Refinery in Western Australia in 2022, only to shutter parts of the operation in January this year as sluggish demand for electric vehicles and slumping prices slowed sales and created a global stockpile of the white battery metal.",Australia close to breaking China’s critical mineral stranglehold,Simon Johanson,The Sydney Morning Herald,2025-02-09T01:00:00,2025-02-09T01:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx859nq9jwo,"The first president of independent Namibia, Sam Nujoma, has died at the age of 95 in the capital Windhoek, the country's current leader has announced. Nujoma led the long fight for independence from South Africa in 1990 after helping found Namibia's liberation movement known as the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) in the 1960s. After independence, Nujoma became president in 1990 and led the country until 2005. Nujoma had been hospitalised over the past three weeks with an illness from which he ""could not recover"", Namibian President Nangolo Mbumba said in a statement announcing the death with ""utmost sorrow and sadness"". He ""inspired us to rise to our feet and to become masters of this vast land of our ancestors,"" President Mbumba said. He added: ""Our founding father lived a long and consequential life during which he exceptionally served the people of his beloved country."" King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla had been ""profoundly saddened"" to learn of Nujoma's death. In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, the King paid tribute to Nujoma's ""lifelong commitment to freedom and democracy"" and ""immense"" contribution to history. Nujoma retired as head of state in 2005, but continued to lead the party before stepping down in 2007 as president of the ruling Swapo party after 47 years at the helm. Many Namibians have reacted to his death with sadness, fondly remembering him as ""father of the nation"", says the BBC's Frauke Jensen in Namibia's capital, Windhoek. A teary-eyed Mbumba visited Nujoma's home to offer condolences to his family, including his wife Kovambo Theopoldine Katjimune, 91. Nujoma is widely credited for ensuring peace and stability after independence from South Africa, which was then under white-minority rule, in 1990. Nujoma's policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other sectors of the economy. He also championed the rights of women and children, including making fathers pay for the maintenance of children born out of wedlock. Namibia's Vice-President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who is due to be inaugurated as president in March after leading Swapo to victory in elections, said his ""visionary leadership and dedication to liberation and nation-building laid the foundation for our free, united nation"".

https://www.npr.org/2025/02/09/g-s1-47467/egypt-emergency-arab-summit,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Egypt announced Sunday it would host a summit of Arab leaders later in the month, amid alarm in the region over President Trump's proposals regarding the future of Gaza. A statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry says the summit is being called in response to a Palestinian request. It said the leaders will gather on Feb. 27 to discuss ""the new and dangerous developments in the Palestinian issue."" Also Sunday, Israeli forces began withdrawing from the Netzarim corridor in Gaza, in the latest stage of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The Netzarim corridor is a four mile strip of land bisecting northern and southern Gaza that Israel fortified during the war, using it as a military zone. Last month, as part of the ceasefire deal, Israel started allowing Palestinians to cross the Netzarim corridor and return to their homes in the North. The withdrawal is part of the six week first phase of the ceasefire, in which Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, while allowing aid to Gaza. In the next stage of the ceasefire, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and ""sustainable calm."" But negotiations are ongoing on the details. Israel wants Hamas' military and political capabilities eliminated, while Hamas wants all Israeli troops removed from Gaza. Egypt's announcement of a summit comes less than a week after many Arab states rejected Trump's recent comments about relocating Gaza's residents and creating a ""Riviera of the Middle East"" there, as have Palestinian leaders. Trump made the proposal Tuesday when he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington D.C. Speaking to reporters at the White House Friday, Trump said he viewed the proposal as ""a real estate transaction, where we'll be an investor in that part of the world."" He added that he was in ""no rush to do anything."" Several countries also condemned a suggestion by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — that Saudi Arabia has enough land for a Palestinian state. Netanyahu appeared to be joking in response to a slip by an Israeli TV interviewer, but his words reverberated through the region at a time when tensions are running high. Also on Sunday, there were emotional scenes in Bangkok airport, as five Thai workers who were released after being held hostage for over a year in Gaza arrived back home. ""We are all very grateful and very happy that we get to return to our homeland. We all would really like to thank you. I don't know what else to say,"" one of the Thai hostages, Pongsak Thaenna, told a news conference at the airport. The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' attack that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage, has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians according to local health authorities. In recent days, violence in the West Bank has intensified. On Sunday morning, the Palestinian Health Ministry said a 23-year-old Palestinian woman, who was eight months pregnant, was fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the Nur Shams urban refugee camp in northern occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said in a statement that it is investigating the incident.",Egypt to host Gaza summit as Israel withdraws troops from Netzarim Corridor,"Jerome Socolovsky, Robbie Griffiths",NPR,2025-02-09T06:13:44,2025-02-09T06:13:44,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250209000700315,"SEOUL, Feb. 9 (Yonhap) -- Thousands of North Korean laborers have been sent to work in Russia last year, South Korea's spy agency said Sunday, in apparent violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang. The North is believed to have dispatched thousands of laborers to various construction sites across Russia last year, according to the National Intelligence Service (NIS), amid workforce shortages in Russia due to its ongoing war with Ukraine. Under U.N. Security Council resolutions in response to North Korea's weapons tests, the country is banned from sending its nationals to work overseas, and all North Korean workers were required to return to their home country by December 2019. North Korea and Russia are suspected of using student visas for the dispatch of North Korean workers. Last year, 13,221 North Koreans entered Russia, up about 12 times from the previous year, Radio Free Asia recently reported, citing data from Russia's federal statistics service. Among those who entered Russia last year, 7,887 of them said their visit was for education purposes. The move comes amid North Korea's continued support for Russia's war efforts against Ukraine. The North is estimated to have dispatched some 11,000 troops to Russia's western front-line region of Kursk to fight Ukrainian forces, according to South Korean officials. yunhwanchae@yna.co.kr(END)",Thousands of N.K. laborers sent to work in Russia in 2024: S.

https://apnews.com/article/alaska-plane-crash-10-dead-9ebe8b2f0b69c6b6cda7d284fbfc35cd,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The remains of all 10 people killed when their small plane crashed into ice on the Bering Sea have been recovered, authorities said. The Nome Volunteer Fire Department made the announcement on its Facebook page Saturday afternoon. Recovery crews had been racing to recover the bodies before a winter storm was expected to hit the region. “All ten individuals aboard the Bering Air plane have been officially brought home,” the fire department wrote in the social media post at about 3 p.m. Crews were still working on recovering the aircraft, the fire department said. The Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet to the hub community of Nome when it disappeared Thursday afternoon. It was found the next day after an extensive search with all nine passengers and the pilot dead, making it one of the deadliest plane crashes in the state in 25 years. The aircraft is on an ice floe that is drifting about 5 miles (8 kilometers) a day, creating difficult conditions for recovery crews, said National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy during a press conference Saturday afternoon. “Please know that we’ll work diligently to determine how this happened with the ultimate goal of improving safety in Alaska and across the United States,” said Homendy. As the community tried to process the deadly event, crews worked swiftly on unstable, slushy sea ice to recover the bodies and the wreckage. The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory, with snow and winds up to 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour) expected to hit the region Saturday night, lasting into Sunday evening. Among those killed in the crash were Rhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson. They had traveled to Unalakleet to service a heat recovery system vital to the community’s water plant, according to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. “The loss of these two incredible individuals and everyone else on board the plane will be felt all over Alaska,” David Beveridge, vice president of environmental health and engineering for the organization, said in a statement. The pilot, 34-year-old Chad Antill of Nome, was also killed. The other victims ranged in age from 30 to 58 years old. The flight was a regularly scheduled commuter trip, according to Lt. Ben Endres of the Alaska State Troopers. A photo provided by the Coast Guard showed the plane’s splintered body and debris lying on the sea ice. Two people in brightly colored emergency gear circled the wreckage. “It’s hard to accept the reality of our loss,” U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said during an evening news conference. Nome Mayor John Handeland choked up as he discussed the deaths and the response effort. “Nome is a strong community, and in challenging times we come together and support each other. I expect the outpouring of support to continue in the coming days as we all work to recover from this tragic incident,” Handeland said. The Cessna Caravan left Unalakleet at 2:37 p.m. Thursday, and officials lost contact with it less than an hour later, according to David Olson, director of operations for Bering Air. There was light snow and fog, with a temperature of 17 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.3 degrees Celsius), according to the National Weather Service. The Coast Guard said the aircraft went missing about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome. Radar forensic data provided by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol indicated that about 3:18 p.m., the plane had “some kind of event which caused them to experience a rapid loss in elevation and a rapid loss in speed,” Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said. “What that event is, I can’t speculate to.” McIntyre-Coble said he was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft. Planes carry an emergency locating transmitter. If exposed to seawater, the device sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message back to the Coast Guard to indicate an aircraft may be in distress. No such messages were received by the Coast Guard, he said. Rescuers were searching the aircraft’s last known location by helicopter when the wreckage was spotted, said Mike Salerno, a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard. Two rescue swimmers were lowered to investigate. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending nine people to the scene from various states. Flying is an essential mode of transportation in Alaska due to the vastness of the landscape and limited infrastructure, and it’s common to travel by small plane. The plane’s crash marks the third major U.S. aviation mishap in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. Bering Air serves 32 villages in western Alaska from hubs in Nome, Kotzebue and Unalakleet. Most destinations receive twice-daily scheduled flights Monday through Saturday. “Our hearts are heavy with grief as we process this heartbreaking news,” Bering Air wrote in a statement on its website. “At this time, our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those affected by this tragedy.” A phone line was set up to give updates and emotional support to people who had loved ones on board, Bering Air said. The company asked for privacy for everyone involved, and said it was committed to supporting authorities. Unalakleet is a community of about 690 people about 150 miles (about 240 kilometers) southeast of Nome and 395 miles (about 640 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage. The village is on the Iditarod trail, route of the world’s most famous sled dog race, during which mushers and their teams must cross the frozen Norton Sound. Nome, a Gold Rush town, is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1,000-mile (1,610-kilometer) Iditarod. The city said prayer vigils would be held Friday for those on board the plane, friends and family and those involved in search efforts. ___ Golden reported from Seattle.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-says-its-ready-to-negotiate-with-us-but-not-under-maximum-pressure-policy/,"TEHRAN, Iran — Iran is ready to negotiate a new nuclear agreement with the United States but not under the “maximum pressure” strategy of US President Donald Trump, Tehran’s chief diplomat suggested on Saturday. “The lifting of sanctions requires negotiations, but not within the framework of a ‘maximum pressure’ policy, because it would not be a negotiation but a form of surrender,” said Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in a statement published on Telegram. The foreign minister’s statement came after Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged the government on Friday not to negotiate with Washington, calling such an approach “reckless.” Khamenei, who has the final say on all strategic decisions in Iran, referred to Iran’s previous experience negotiating with the United States to justify his position, saying that negotiations with the US “are not intelligent, wise or honorable.” In 2015, Iran struck a landmark deal with the United States, France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia to regulate its nuclear program in return for the easing of international sanctions. However, in 2018, during his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the agreement and reinstated heavy sanctions on Tehran, despite European opposition, crippling the country’s economy. Trump on Wednesday called for a “verified nuclear peace agreement” with Iran, adding that it “cannot have a nuclear weapon.” Iran insists its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes and denies any intention to develop atomic weapons. However, the UN nuclear watchdog has said that Iran is currently enriching uranium to levels that have no civilian use, and Iran’s leaders have for many years been issuing threats to flatten entire Israeli cities. The US president reinstated on Tuesday his “maximum pressure” policy, and Washington on Thursday announced financial sanctions on entities and individuals accused of shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian crude oil to China. Aragchi said on Saturday that “Iran does not want to negotiate with a country that is simultaneously imposing new sanctions.” Times of Israel Staff contributed to this report.","Iran says it’s ready to negotiate with US, but not under ‘maximum pressure’ policy",AFP,The Times of Israel,2025-02-08T22:49:11,2025-02-08T23:02:19,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/china-us-panama-canal-belt-road-9452852d8e074902d3f2a75fa73f5060,"BEIJING (AP) — China on Friday lashed out at what it called U.S. “coercion” after Panama declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing following Washington’s threat to take back the Panama Canal. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a briefing that China “firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.” Assistant Foreign Minister Zhao Zhiyuan also met Panama’s ambassador to China and lodged solemn representations on Friday, the Foreign Ministry said Saturday. The Belt and Road Initiative is President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign police drive to bind China closer to countries in the region and beyond by building roads, railways, airports, power plants and other infrastructure. The program has completed some major projects but also raised concerns about debt and environmental impact. Panama’s decision to walk away from it was seen as a concession to the U.S. over the canal after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Panamanian leader José Raúl Mulino on Sunday that Panama must immediately reduce what President Donald Trump says is Chinese influence over the canal area or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino has rejected pressure from the new U.S. government to discuss ownership of a waterway that is vital to global trade. Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. Despite that, some believe Panama may be open to a compromise under which canal operations on both sides are taken away from the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports company, which was given a 25-year no-bid extension to run them. An audit into the suitability of that extension is already underway and could lead to a rebidding process. A drop in water levels in the canal due to drought has slowed transit through the canal, raising further complaints from Trump, although the delays appear to have nothing to do with China. Lin said the Belt and Road Initiative has brought “active participation” from over 150 countries and that it has brought “fruitful results” to Panama and China, but gave no examples. “We hope Panama will bear in mind the general picture of bilateral relationship and the long-term interests of both peoples, resist external interference, and make the right decision,” Lin said.",China lashes out at US 'coercion' after Panama declines to renew infrastructure agreement,,AP News,2025-02-07T09:21:38,2025-02-08T04:23:51,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c627d55v07go,"More than three decades after leaving the Soviet Union, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have begun to unplug from Russia's electricity grid and join the EU's network. The two-day process began on Saturday morning, with residents told to charge their devices, stock up on food and water, and prepare as if severe weather is forecast. Many have been told not to use lifts - while in some areas traffic lights will be turned off. A giant, specially-made clock, will count down the final seconds before the transition at a landmark ceremony in Lithuania's capital on Sunday, attended by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. The three nations will then officially transition away from the grid that has connected them to Russia since the years after World War Two. 'On high alert' The so-called Brell power grid - which stands for Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania - is controlled almost entirely by Moscow and has long been seen as a vulnerability for the three Baltic states. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are now Nato members and have not purchased electricity from Russia since 2022, but their connection to the Brell grid left them dependent on Moscow for energy flow. After disconnecting on Saturday morning, the three countries will carry out frequency tests before integrating into the European grid via Poland on Sunday. ""We are now removing Russia's ability to use the electricity system as a tool of geopolitical blackmail,"" Lithuania's Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas told AFP news agency. ""It's the culmination of efforts over more than 10 years or 20 years, to reduce that energy dependence,"" Prof David Smith of the Baltic Research Unit at the University of Glasgow told the BBC. ""When the Baltic States joined the EU and Nato, everybody talked about them being an energy island that was still dependent on that joint electricity network with Belarus and Russia,"" said Smith. ""That's been completely broken now."" Tensions between the Baltic States and Russia, which share a combined 543 mile-long (874km) border, have soared since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

The oil tanker Eagle S was seized by Finnish authorities on suspicion of damaging undersea cables In the past 18 months, at least 11 cables running under the Baltic Sea have been damaged. In a recent case,  a ship from Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of oil tankers was accused of damaging Estonia's main power link in the Gulf of Finland. The Kremlin declined to comment.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-841187,"Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei met with senior Hamas members on Saturday. The meeting is one of the most recent high-profile gatherings by the ayatollah, and it reflects Iran’s view that the terrorist group was victorious in the 15-month war with Israel, which began with the Hamas massacre on October 7, 2023. “Palestine will emerge victorious against its enemies,” Khamenei said, according to Iranian state media. Muhammad Ismail Darwish, chairman of Hamas’s Shura Council, and Khalil al-Hayya, deputy chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau, were in Iran this weekend. They usually live in Qatar, a major non-NATO ally of the US. Hamas members have flown between Doha and Tehran in the past and can often meet openly in Qatar with Iranian officials. Darwish and other Hamas officials were seen in photos distributed by the Iranian regime during their meeting with Khamenei. The ayatollah said the people of Gaza defeated “the Zionist regime, and in fact, America, and didn’t let them reach any of their goals,” Iran’s Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported. Iranian media noted that the country believes post-war Gaza will be run “entirely by the Palestinian people.” This report came on Saturday after Hamas released three Israeli hostages – Or Levy, Ohad Ben-Ami, and Eli Sharabi – who appeared emaciated. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said that they “look like Holocaust survivors.” Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch said, “The State of Israel views with grave concern the repeated violations of Hamas, and with even greater concern the condition of the three hostages released this morning. This will not go unaddressed. The message was conveyed to the mediators, and measures will be taken accordingly.” Meanwhile, Iran hosted Hamas officials. Iranian media noted that the meeting came during the “fifth prisoner exchange with Israel.” Hamas clearly believes it will run Gaza and is not afraid of either Israeli claims or US President Donald Trump’s plan that was released when he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week. Hamas is bragging in Gaza that “we are a storm...We are the post-war day,” according to a statement the terrorist group placed on a poster during the latest hostage release. Hamas also claims that it abides by “human values and the provisions of international humanitarian law.” This is in contrast to how the hostages appeared on Saturday. Hamas is clearly aware of this and is spreading propaganda. “Hamas reiterated that the Palestinian people stood firm against the occupiers and rejected any plans by Israel and its ally, the United States, to forcibly displace Gazans from their homeland,” Iranian state media reported. “The absolute victory that war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu and the occupying army sought for 471 days was an illusion that has been shattered forever,” Hamas said. The Iranian high-level meeting with Hamas officials is supposed to show that Iran and Hamas will continue to coordinate. It is designed to respond to Trump’s assertions.",Iran's Khamenei meets Hamas leaders during Gaza hostage release,SETH J.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-841177,"Released hostages Or Levy, Eli (Eliyahu) Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami crossed the border into Israeli territory on Saturday after spending 491 days in captivity, leaving 76 hostages, both dead and alive, remaining in the Gaza Strip. An initial medical examination reported to Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Sheba Medical Center revealed that the former hostages were in serious condition. They appeared starved and may have lost some 30% of their overall weight. The IDF initially estimated that the hostages would be returned at around 10:00 a.m. in central Gaza. Ultimately, they were not brought out until a little over an hour later. ICRC vehicles arrived in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza to collect the three from the Hamas terrorist organization, and Red Cross personnel signed documents given by Hamas for their release. Appearing frail and being supported by Hamas terrorists, the three hostages were forced to speak onstage before being handed over to the ICRC. In live streams from the Jordanian Alghad TV and Al Jazeera, a stage similar to the one used by Hamas during previous hostage releases was seen. Numerous armed Hamas terrorists were also at the scene. ""Two hundred Qassam members (members of Hamas's military wing) are participating in securing the handover of the Israeli detainees,"" a Hamas source told the Saudi news outlet Asharq Al-Awsat prior to the release of the Israeli captives. Later, Gazan civilians, including women and children, could be seen flooding in to observe the event. ""The disturbing images from the release of Ohad, Eli, and Or serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt - there is no time to waste for the hostages!"" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum stated shortly after the three hostages were released. ""We must get them all out, down to the very last hostage. Now!"" The Prime Minister's Office issued a statement announcing its pleasure over the return of the hostages, adding that it was committed to returning the hostages who still remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza. ""The Israeli government embraces the return of the hostages. Their families have been updated that they are with our forces,"" the PMO stated. ""The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed,"" referring to the serious conditions the hostages were in when they were released, notably having lost a lot of weight while in captivity. The PMO also stated that ""In light of the dire condition of the three hostages and the repeated violations by the Hamas terrorist organization, Prime Minister Netanyahu has instructed not to overlook this and to take appropriate action."" Opposition Leader Yair Lapid accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of not taking the conditions of the hostages seriously on Saturday. â		Did you now see that the conditions of the hostages are serious?â		 Lapid asked. â		Didn't you know before? Because it was written in the intelligence documents that were placed on your desk in recent months. You have seen these reports just like I have.â		 Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the severe weight loss and serious conditions of released hostages is a ""crime against humanity"" in an X post on Saturday. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar conveyed a message to his international counterparts worldwide on Saturday on the severity of the crimes Hamas committed against the hostages they’ve held captive. â		For over a year, the entire international community has danced to the false sound of the so-called ‘starvation’ propaganda in Gaza. â		But the pictures don't lie: The Hamas terrorists and the Gaza residents look great. The Israeli hostages look like Holocaust survivors and are the only ones in the photos who appear to have clearly suffered from starvation. 		 Hamas committed crimes against humanity on kidnapped civilians,â		 he continued. â		The Hamas-Nazi evil must be eradicated.â		 In exchange for the three hostages, Israel turned over 183 Palestinian security prisoners. Many of the Palestinians have been convicted of terrorism offenses and have been involved in the murder of Israelis. Levy, Sharabi, and Ben Ami were kidnapped on October 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel. A report from Channel 12 indicated that Sharabi told IDF soldiers he was looking forward to meeting his wife, Leanne, and daughters Noya, 16, and Yahel, 13, unaware they had been tragically murdered in their home in Be'eri in the October 7 massacre, as Hamas terrorists dragged him to the Gaza Strip. ""Eli is returning from an impossible reality in captivity to a very difficult reality in Israel,"" Kibbutz Be'eri said in a statement. ""A reality in which those dearest to him are no longer alive - on October 7, Eli lost his daughters Noya and Yahel, and his wife Leanne, who were murdered in their house in Be'eri in the terrible massacre. His brother, the late Yossi Sharabi, was murdered in captivity, and his body is still being held in Gaza. We will embrace him and give him the best possible support."" Yulie, Ella, and Natalie, the daughters of former hostage Ohad Ben Ami, spoke with their father on Saturday at Ichilov Hospital after his release from Hamas captivity, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum reported. ""Our father has emerged from the horror, and you can see the trauma he endured written on his face,"" Yulie, Ella, and Natalie stated. ""But we are staying strong for him here, just as he stays strong for us, and soon, we'll be able to embrace him. We got our father back. Now, we must not stop until the last hostage is returned.""

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/taiwan-sends-officials-to-us-to-discuss-possible-trump-tariffs,"TAIPEI – Taiwan has sent officials to Washington to discuss possible US tariffs by President Donald Trump, and has made preparations should they be imposed, Economic Affairs Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said on Feb 8. Tech firms in Taiwan, home to the world’s largest contract chipmaker TSMC, face the possibility that Mr Trump will follow through on threats to put tariffs on imported chips after he accused Taiwan during his 2024 campaign of having stolen American semiconductor business. Mr Trump said on Feb 7 that he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on many economies by Feb 10 or Feb 11, a major escalation of his offensive to reshape global trade relationships in ways he considers to be in America’s favour. Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Mr Kuo said the Ministry of Economic Affairs has made preparations for any US tariffs, but declined to give details. Asked about chip tariffs, Mr Kuo said he has dispatched a deputy minister and a deputy section chief to Washington. He did not identify them or offer further details. They will, as much as possible, “give some rather good explanations to Trump’s people” about Taiwan’s chip industry, he added, without elaborating. “Taiwan is the United States’ best partner.” Taiwan has repeatedly said its chip sector and US companies have “win-win” cooperation. But Taiwan runs a large trade surplus with the US that surged 83 per cent in 2024, with the island’s exports to the US hitting a record US$111.4 billion (S$151 billion), driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors. Mr Kuo suggested that Taiwan could follow Japan’s example and import more US energy. “In reference to Japan, he has great determination when it comes to energy,” he said, referring to Mr Trump. “We hope we can satisfy US demands when it comes to this.” Japan will soon begin importing a record amount of US liquefied natural gas (LNG), Mr Trump said on Feb 7, after talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Australia and Qatar are currently Taiwan’s main suppliers of LNG. REUTERS JoinST's Telegram channeland get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-politicians-journalist-jailed-5e1fdd9931ac621037a4132b07d9bbeb,"A judge in Tunisia handed down lengthy sentences to prominent politicians and at least one leading journalist in a move criticized by a media union and leading opposition parties as the latest move targeting critics of President Kais Saied. Among those sentenced Wednesday include 83-year-old Rached Ghannouchi, the country’s most prominent opposition leader, who has been behind bars for nearly two years. Ghannouchi, the co-founder of the Islamist movement Ennahda and Tunisia’s former Assembly Speaker, was sentenced to an additional 22 years in prison for undermining state security. He boycotted the proceedings against him. Ennahda condemned the trial as politically motivated and said the prosecutions were “aimed at revenge, violating basic human rights and freedoms, undermining the rule of law and blatantly politicizing the judiciary.” The National Salvation Front, a coalition of opposition parties that includes Ennahda, said in a statement that the sentences issued against bloggers, politicians and former government officials totaled more than 760 years and marked “one of the darkest periods” for the country’s judicial branch, which has seen judges dismissed and power wrested from it by Saied’s executive branch. “This particular chamber is becoming a specialized tool for issuing harsh sentences against politicians,” said one of its leaders, Ahmed Nejib Chebbi. The charges stem from a 2019 case against a media company that provided services for Ennahda during that year’s presidential elections. The charges stem from a 2019 case against a media company that prosecutors say provided services for various candidates during that year’s presidential elections. Those involved are accused of defamation, spreading falsehoods, money laundering, undermining state security and illegally accepting funds from abroad. Ennahda has denied working with the company yet was targeted by the court as part of the investigation. Human rights groups have criticized such cases as a way to target Saied’s opponents. Saied won a second term last October in a landslide election while his leading opponents, including Ghannouchi, languished in prison. “These rulings bring Tunisia back to a period the people sought to leave behind through their revolution,” an Ennahda statement on Thursday said, referring to the 2011 ouster of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the first Arab dictator toppled as part of the Arab Spring uprising that swept the region that year. In the years that followed, the North African nation was seen as a success story for its transition to democracy, rewriting its constitution and winning a Nobel Peace Prize for political compromise. But signs of authoritarianism have re-emerged since Saied took power in 2019. Throughout his tenure, Saied has suspended parliament, rewritten the constitution to consolidate his power and arrested politicians, activists and journalists who criticized him. The court on Wednesday also sentenced in absentia a group of Ennahda politicians who’ve fled the country and now live in exile, including former Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, who was sentenced to 35 years on state security charges similar to Ghannouchi’s. Journalist Chadha Haj Mubarak was sentenced to five years in prison as part of the same case, the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists said. The union called for her immediate release and in a statement denounced the court’s lack of respect for press freedoms. In a statement Mubarak’s attorney, Souhail Medimegh, said his client was being charged purely for her journalism. __ Metz reported from Rabat, Morocco. __A previous version of this story erroneously stated that Ennahda hired the media company that was later investigated for the content it published. The political party maintained throughout court proceedings that it never contracted them for any services.",Tunisia jails opposition politicians and journalist as crackdown on political dissent resumes,SAM METZ,AP News,2025-02-06T13:53:41,2025-02-07T10:51:11,gemini-2.0-flash

In the meeting, Xi also said he hopes to maintain ""stability"" in the Seoul-Beijing relationship, noting that the bilateral relationship has contributed to ""peace"" and ""development"" in the region. ""China and South Korea should work together to consolidate the strategic and cooperative partnership amid heightened uncertainties in the region and across the globe,"" Xi added, calling for deeper trade and economic cooperation between the two countries. Woo called for bilateral cooperation in advanced technologies and supply chains as well as progress in negotiations to expand the countries' free trade agreement. On the ongoing political turmoil in South Korea, Xi said he believes South Koreans have the ""wisdom and power"" to solve the situation, referring to the martial law fiasco and the push to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol, according to Woo's office. Woo told Xi that South Korea is responding to the situation in accordance with related laws and the Constitution, explaining the country is not unstable. The two also discussed other various topics, including China's ban on Korean culture content as well as a project aimed at excavating the remains of Ahn Jung-geun, a well-known Korean independence fighter during the colonial era. During Japan's colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945, Ahn led Korea's independence movement in China, assassinating Ito Hirobumi, Japan's first prime minister and resident-general of Korea, at Harbin Station. As for culture, Woo told Xi it is difficult to find Korean content in China, while South Koreans enjoy diverse Chinese content from movies to games. ""It is essential that young adults in the two countries communicate with each other and have an amicable relationship through cultural exchange,"" Woo said.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hostages-eli-sharabi-or-levy-and-ohad-ben-ami-slated-for-release-from-gaza-saturday/,"Hamas on Friday evening named three hostages set to be released from captivity the next day, following an hours-long delay past the 4 p.m. deadline. The Prime Minister’s Office and the Hostages Families Forum both confirmed that the hostages to be released were Ohad Ben Ami, 56, Eli Sharabi, 52, and Or Levy, 34. The release was expected to begin on Saturday morning. Sharabi was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri when Hamas terrorists rampaged through southern Israel on October 7, 2023. His wife and daughters were murdered in their home’s safe room and he and his brother Yossi were taken captive. Yossi has since been confirmed dead and Hamas is holding his body. Sharabi’s family said in a statement: “Today more than ever, we want to show him he was never alone. We want him to know he’s returning to a people who stood by him, in Israel and around the world, that did not forget him or give up, that fought for him and that will be there for him now in his journey back to life.” Levy, 34, was kidnapped from the Supernova rave near Kibbutz Re’im on October 7. His wife Eynav was killed, and their now three-year-old son Almog has been staying with his grandparents since. He has been told for the past 16 months that his father is missing and is being searched for. Levy’s mother Ola told Channel 13: “My heart’s about to leap out of my chest. I’m so emotional, mainly for Or’s son Almog. Almog knows his dad’s being released tomorrow. He said ‘Dad’s coming back’ and jumped up and down on the bed with joy.” Levy’s brother Michael wrote on Facebook: “Mogi, we found your dad.” Ben Ami was kidnapped from Be’eri. His wife Raz Ben Ami was also abducted, and released as part of a week-long ceasefire in November 2023. Their daughters campaigned hard for their freedom. Daughter Ell Ben Ami published an Instagram video of her and her overjoyed sisters piling up on each other on their balcony as they croon “Dad’s coming home!” Daughter Natalie posted a video of herself tearing up immediately after hearing the news, writing, “Finally our hearts will be whole!” ×©×¤×	×

×”×	×ª×	×¨×	×	pic.twitter.com — ×™×©×¨×	×™×	 (@IsraelHayomHeb)February 7, 2025 “We have both a sacred duty and a moral right to bring all our brothers and sisters home,” the Hostages Forum said in a statement. “We will not give up or stop at any point until all hostages return home under the current agreement — down to the very last one — the living for rehabilitation, and the deceased for proper burial.” The Hamas prisoners’ media office said Israel was expected to free 183 Palestinians in exchange for the release of three hostages, including 18 who have been serving life sentences, 54 serving long sentences and 111 who were detained in the Gaza Strip during the war. The terror group’s delay in providing the list of hostages to be freed Saturday underlined the obstacles hanging over the fragile deal that has halted the war in Gaza. Earlier Hamas had accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire accord, claiming it had delayed the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying food and other humanitarian supplies agreed under the truce deal that took effect on January 19, and holding back all but a fraction of the tents and mobile homes needed to provide shelter to people returning to their bombed-out homes. “This demonstrates clear manipulation of relief and shelter priorities,” Hamas said in a statement. COGAT, the Israeli military agency that is overseeing the aid deliveries into Gaza, denied the accusation and warned that Israel would “not tolerate violations by Hamas.” The Prime Minister’s Office also put out a statement saying the Israeli leader viewed such violations “gravely.” The spat compounds the uncertainty around the ceasefire that had already mounted following US President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement this week that he wants Gaza to be taken over by the United States. Trump said on Tuesday he wanted to move the population of Gaza to a third country like Egypt or Jordan and place the small coastal enclave under US control to be developed into the “Riviera of the Middle East.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsed Trump’s vision for Gaza as a “remarkable” plan, but it was immediately rejected by Arab countries, Palestinian groups including Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, and many Gazans, who said they would rebuild their homes themselves. However, Israeli leaders have repeated the line that Gazans who wish should be able to leave and Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered the army on Thursday to prepare a plan to allow for the departure of Gaza residents who wanted to go. So far, 13 Israeli hostages of the 33 children, women and older men set to be released in the first, 42-day phase of the agreement have come home, and hundreds of Palestinian terror convicts have been released in exchange. Five Thai hostages have also been returned. Work on the potential second stage of the multi-phase agreement, aimed at securing the release of around 60 male hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, has begun and an Israeli negotiating team was expected to fly on Saturday to Doha, Hebrew media reported on Friday. The Israeli military said on Friday that commanders were conducting situational assessments ahead of the next phase of the agreement currently being discussed, with troops deployed at various points around the Gaza Strip. Hamas said only 8,500 trucks out of the 12,000 that should have arrived so far had entered the territory, most containing food and secondary goods including chips and chocolate instead of more urgent items. In addition, only 10% of the 200,000 tents and 60,000 caravans needed to provide shelter had arrived, Hamas said, leaving hundreds of thousands in harsh winter weather. Finally, heavy machinery needed to clear millions of tons of rubble and recover the thousands of bodies thought to be buried had not arrived. Almost three weeks after the start of the ceasefire, “the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate dangerously,” the Hamas statement said. Israel has rejected accusations that it is dragging its feet on enabling the entry to aid supplies as “a completely unfounded claim,” saying it has allowed in thousands of trucks, including tents and shelters. COGAT said more than 100,000 tents had entered Gaza since the agreement came into force last month and that caravans were also being allowed in, while tractors had entered from Egypt since Sunday. It said 12,600 trucks had entered Gaza so far. Friday also saw freed hostages Keith Siegel, 65, and Ofer Calderon, 54, discharged from hospitals after spending several days under care following their release from Gaza. In a statement upon his release, the Calderon family said that Ofer’s “journey to recovery is still long and will not end until all the hostages return home.” “Ofer promises to join the fight for their return at the first opportunity he can,” they added. The third hostage freed with Calderon and Siegel last Saturday was Yarden Bibas, whose wife and young children remain in Gaza, their fates unknown. According to Channel 12 news, Israel is pressuring mediators to secure the release of Shiri Bibas and her young sons, Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 2. Hamas was to release living women and children first under the deal, and Israel has said it has “grave concern” for their lives. A Hamas official cited by the network said the terror group would see how Trump’s plan to “take over” the Gaza Strip progresses before deciding on the fate of the deal. According to the network, the terror group is unlikely to thwart the rest of the first phase, including Saturday’s expected hostage release. In total, Israel has said it would release up to 1,904 Palestinian prisoners — including 737 serving life terms for dozens of murders — in return for 33 Israeli hostages during the deal’s first phase. Though talks for the second phase were supposed to commence Monday, Netanyahu has pushed off sending a negotiating team, reportedly until he returns from Washington next week. A working-level negotiating team, led by the outgoing Shin Bet deputy director — known by his Hebrew initial “Mem” — is expected in Doha over the weekend, but is empowered to discuss only the first phase, not the second, according to Channel 12. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s spokesman denied reports that the premier presented in Washington a plan to end the fighting in Gaza — a sine qua non for the second stage, but a red line for the right flank of Netanyahu’s coalition. The delay in talks on the second phase has deeply worried the families of male hostages who are not set to be released until phases two and three. Moshe Or, brother of hostage Avinatan Or, told Channel 12 that “there is a feeling that the second phase is disintegrating. [People are] starting to talk about all sorts of other things, flattening Gaza, moving the Palestinians… In our view it’s unacceptable and scary that [they’re] starting to talk that way and forget about [the hostages].” Avinatan marked his 32nd birthday on Thursday. His girlfriend Noa Argamani, who was rescued from Hamas captivity in June, wrote on Instagram that she was “doing everything to get you back, to get to the second phase of the deal so you’re not left behind.” Argamani herself is currently in Washington with a delegation of hostage families determined to ensure that the deal proceeds to its second phase. On Thursday, Trump honored her in a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, saying she “showed unwavering strength and courage and faith as she endured the unendurable.” “By the grace of God, she was rescued by the Israel Defense Forces and now she’s come back to pray with us this morning,” said Trump. “As president, I will not rest until every remaining hostage has been returned to their families,” he vowed.","Hostages Eli Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami slated for release from Gaza Saturday",ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-02-07T18:06:55,2025-02-08T07:58:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/missing-aircraft-alaska-search-10-people-eb496188285ed54c9a527f658d4ff70a,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — A small commuter plane that crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome was located Friday on sea ice, and all 10 people on board were dead, authorities said. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in the last 25 years. Rescuers were searching the aircraft’s last known location by helicopter when the wreckage was spotted, said Mike Salerno, a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard. Two rescue swimmers were lowered to investigate. A photo provided by the Coast Guard showed the plane’s splintered body and debris lying on the sea ice. Two people in brightly colored emergency gear circled the wreckage. “It’s hard to accept the reality of our loss,” U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said during an evening news conference. Nome Mayor John Handeland choked up as he discussed the deaths and the response effort. “Nome is a strong community, and in challenging times we come together and support each other. I expect the outpouring of support to continue in the coming days as we all work to recover from this tragic incident,” Handeland said. A prayer service was announced for later in the evening. Related Stories Already the focus was shifting to a recovery operation because of rapidly changing conditions. Officials outlined the challenges including bad weather expected in the next 18 hours and “young ice” that was slushy and not stable. “They are on the ice as we speak,” said Jim West, chief of the Nome Volunteer Fire Department. “The conditions out there are dynamic, and so we’ve got to do it safely and the fastest way we can.” The Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet on Thursday afternoon with nine passengers and a pilot, Alaska’s Department of Public Safety said. It was operating at its maximum passenger capacity, according to the airline’s description of the plane. The Cessna Caravan left Unalakleet at 2:37 p.m., and officials lost contact with it less than an hour later, according to David Olson, director of operations for Bering Air. There was light snow and fog, with a temperature of 17 degrees (minus 8.3 Celsius), according to the National Weather Service. The Coast Guard said the aircraft went missing about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome. Radar forensic data provided by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol indicated that about 3:18 p.m., the plane had “some kind of event which caused them to experience a rapid loss in elevation and a rapid loss in speed,” Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said. “What that event is, I can’t speculate to.” McIntyre-Coble said he was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft. Planes carry an emergency locating transmitter. If exposed to seawater, the device sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message back to the Coast Guard to indicate an aircraft may be in distress. No such messages were received by the Coast Guard, he said. All 10 people on board the plane were adults, and the flight was a regularly scheduled commuter trip, according to Lt. Ben Endres of the Alaska State Troopers. Two people who died in the crash were on a work trip for a non-profit tribal health organization, according to Alaska’s News Source. The other people’s names have not been released. Local, state and federal agencies had assisted in the search effort, combing stretches of ice-dotted waters and scouring miles of frozen tundra. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending nine people to the scene from various states. Flying is an essential mode of transportation in Alaska due to the vastness of the landscape and limited infrastructure. Most communities are not connected to the developed road system that serves the state’s most populous region, and it’s common to travel by small plane. Some high school teams fly to sporting events against rival high schools, and goods are brought to many communities by barge or by air. The plane’s crash marks the third major U.S. aviation mishap in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. Bering Air serves 32 villages in western Alaska from hubs in Nome, Kotzebue and Unalakleet. Most destinations receive twice-daily scheduled flights Monday through Saturday. Unalakleet is a community of about 690 people about 150 miles (about 240 kilometers) southeast of Nome and 395 miles (about 640 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage. The village is on the Iditarod trail, route of the world’s most famous sled dog race, during which mushers and their teams must cross the frozen Norton Sound. Nome, a Gold Rush town, is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1,000-mile (1,610-kilometer) Iditarod. The city said prayer vigils would be held Friday for those on board the plane, friends and family and those involved in search efforts. ___ Golden reported from Seattle.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjdp7m7wkdo,"Gang rule in Haiti has led to a staggering rise in sexual violence against children, the United Nations' children's organisation has warned. The Caribbean island has been in the grip of violent gangs for several years who have been treating the population with unrelenting brutality, Unicef said. Sexual violence against children has increased 1,000% since 2023, turning their bodies ""into battlegrounds"", spokesman James Elder said. Unicef estimates 85% of the capital Port-au-Prince is under the control of gangs. More than one million children are living with the constant threat of violence. Mr Elder gave an example of a 16-year-old girl who had left home to go shopping, and then was seized by armed men. She was beaten, drugged, and repeatedly raped. She was held for around one month, he said, until the gang let her go when they realised her family had no money to pay a ransom. Kidnappings for extortion are common in Haiti. She is now in a UN shelter with dozens of other girls receiving care. Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis. More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti last year alone. Haiti's transitional presidential council, the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order, appears to be in turmoil. The council replaced the interim prime minister in November but has made little progress towards organising long-delayed elections. Children are also being recruited by the gangs, sometimes forcibly, Unicef said. The organisation has come across child gang members who are as young as eight. The basics that Haitian children need for a normal childhood, even if they are still at home with their families, are virtually non-existent said Unicef. Schools and hospitals are barely functioning and tens of thousands of children are not in school. Unicef has created mobile safe spaces in Haiti to try to support children, and to prevent sexual violence. But last year, when it appealed for $221.4m (£177.8m) to fund its work in Haiti, it received just a quarter of that. It's feared now that with the US freeze on foreign aid affecting humanitarian projects worldwide, Haiti's needs will be neglected again.","Sexual violence against children in Haiti rises by 1,000%, UN says",Imogen Foulkes,BBC News,2025-02-07T08:30:20,2025-02-07T08:38:30,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.voanews.com/a/china-may-fill-aid-void-left-by-usaid-shutdown-but-its-own-challenges-could-limit-it/7965690.html,"WASHINGTON —
The U.S. foreign aid agency broadly shut down by the Trump administration has long been criticized by Beijing. But as USAID projects wind down, will Beijing step in to try to build influence? Some analysts say although China will want to fill the vacuum, its own economic problems could limit what it will do.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is now the acting director of U.S. Agency for International Development, said he will bring the agency's activities in line with the agenda of the new government.
""These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest,"" he told reporters while visiting El Salvador earlier this week.
USAID had an annual budget of more than $40 billion and managed aid programs around the world, including a China-related program that has become a target of criticism by the White House.
On a ""waste and abuse"" fact sheet released on Feb. 3, the White House said USAID had given millions of dollars to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. organization working on protections against infectious disease. The organization has been accused of working with Wuhan Institute of Virology on coronavirus research that had caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Both EcoHealth Alliance and the Chinese government have rejected those accusations.
Agency has framed funding as strategy
In recent years, USAID has increasingly framed its funding for China-related programs as a strategy to contain China's global expansion through aid and investments.
An archived page of USAID's now-closed website shows that the agency lauded its ""Countering Chinese Influence Fund"" as one of its ""key accomplishments."" The fund ""will advance national-security goals"" to ""build more resilient partners that are able to withstand pressure from the CCP and other malign actors.""
Michael Schiffer, former USAID assistant administrator for Asia, told a congressional panel in 2023 that the agency had for more than a decade supported data collection on China's overseas investments through AidData, a research group at the College of William and Mary in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The funding freeze has put at least one such USAID-funded program in financial trouble. Brian Eyler, a researcher at the Stimson Center in Washington, wrote in a public post on Facebook his Southeast Asia program could have difficulty continuing operation because of the freeze.
""We are ordered to stop work on those grants for 90 days pending further review. And that means our Southeast Asia program might not be able to keep the lights on,"" he wrote.
Eyler is co-lead on the Mekong Dam Monitor, launched by the State Department during the first Trump administration to study how dams built by China and other countries on the Mekong River in southeast Asia have negatively affected communities downstream. In the past, the project had received funding from both the State Department and USAID.
Chinese state media had accused the project of smearing China.
In an email to VOA Mandarin, Eyler wrote that although the Mekong Dam Monitor is not being affected by the federal government’s grant freeze as the project has been supported through private funding since last fall, other projects focused on the Mekong River are now in financial jeopardy.
On Wednesday, Rubio said the Trump administration is in the process of identifying programs that are exempted from the funding freeze.
""This [is] not about ending foreign aid. It is about structuring it in a way that furthers the national interest of the United States,"" Rubio said during his multiday trip to Latin America.
Critics of USAID
USAID also has been a target of Beijing's ire. China's foreign ministry released a report last year accusing USAID programs of corruption and prioritizing the advancement of U.S. interests.
The shutdown of USAID has been met with cheers and celebrations on the Chinese internet, where anti-U.S. narratives permeate. Many users praised Elon Musk, the billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency, for closing the agency.
Musk previously posted on X describing USAID as ""a criminal organization"" and that it is time ""for it to die.""
USAID critics
Critics of the funding freeze and the shuttering of USAID worry that Beijing will see this as an opportunity to fill the void left by the U.S.
""China has spent trillions of dollars in numerous countries because it is interested in pulling them into its sphere of influence,"" U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Coons wrote in The Washington Post.
Steven Balla, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., told VOA Mandarin he agrees with the assessment. But he said China's plan to expand foreign aid is likely to be hindered by its lingering domestic problems.
""You think about youth unemployment; you think about the real estate bubble and so forth,"" he said. ""That might make it difficult for the Xi administration to aggressively expand into new parts of the world because the U.S is pulling back.""
Some activists worry that even if China tries to fill the void, certain areas where there once were U.S. aid programs will not receive the same kind of funding, if at all.
A former environmental lawyer in China who now lives in the U.S. told VOA Mandarin that, compared to U.S. aid programs, China's assistance is of a more transactional nature and seeks financial returns. She wants to remain anonymous because she fears harassment from Beijing.
A 2021 report released by China shows that between 2013 and 2018, China had spent $376 billion on foreign aid, 45% of which went to Africa in areas such as agriculture, medical assistance, food supply, disease control, and climate change.
The former environmental lawyer said if it is entirely left for China to provide aid, areas such as women's rights and natural resource management will lose a large portion of funding, if not entirely, because China is not interested in improving local governance.
