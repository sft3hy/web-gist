https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-norway-defense-pact-arctic-russia-undersea-cables-war-ukraine/,"The U.K. and Norway began negotiations Thursday on a defense deal aimed at countering the threat from Russia in the Arctic. British Defense Secretary John Healey met his Norwegian counterpart Tore Sandvik at the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, a fortress tunneled deep into the side of a mountain near the northern town of Bodø just above the Arctic Circle. The defense agreement will see closer working between the two nations' armed forces, including protecting undersea cables from sabotage. Since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ships traveling to or from Russian ports have been suspected of severing key European infrastructure links — whether by accident or sabotage — particularly in the Baltic Sea. Healey said: “Norway remains one of the U.K.’s most important allies. We will create a new era of defense partnership to bring us closer than ever before as we tackle increasing threats, strengthen NATO, and boost our security in the High North. “The U.K. is determined to play a leadership role on European security, supporting the foundations for our security and prosperity at home and showing our adversaries that we are united in our determination to protect our interests.” The defense secretary's comments come as tensions between the U.S. and Europe over Ukrainian peace negotiations escalate. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed Russia ""have the cards"" in talks and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ""dictator"" for not holding elections in wartime. The U.S. has also argued European NATO members must spend more on defense, with the U.K. working toward allocating 2.5 percent of GDP to its military capabilities. Healey said Tuesday the British Ministry of Defense would undergo its “biggest defense shake up in 50 years” to ensure it was ready for war. When meeting Norwegian troops patrolling the border with Russia Wednesday, Healey said he was ""really interested"" they had conscription, which isn't the case in the U.K. Healey's visit followed a Russian spy ship entering U.K. waters in January and last November. The defense secretary told parliament last month the vessel was ""used for gathering intelligence and mapping the U.K.'s critical underwater infrastructure"" before it sailed through to the North Sea.",UK and Norway start Arctic defense pact talks to combat Putin,Noah Keate,POLITICO,2025-02-20T14:33:39,2025-02-20T14:34:04,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-democratic-party-disbands-2ca9c8700b4f62335e9c7608d7172f99,"HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy party took an initial step toward dissolving Thursday, in the latest sign of the Chinese territory’s narrowing space for civil society groups following Beijng’s crackdown on dissent. The Democratic Party’s central committee decided to set up a task force to look into the procedures involved in dissolving the party. A final decision would require approval of the party’s members. Party Chairperson Lo Kin-hei said at a news conference late Thursday that party leaders made the decision based the current political situation and social climate, and said the party did not have any acute financial burdens. “When we have to move toward this direction, we, of course, feel it is a pity. I believe every member cherishes the existence of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong,” he said. Founded in 1994, the Democratic Party is one of the few pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong, where political activism has faced a stern crackdown from China’s central government in Beijing following anti-government protests by Hong Kongers in 2019. Its prominent party members include Martin Lee, nicknamed the city’s “Father of Democracy,” Albert Ho, former leader of a now-defunct group that organized Tiananmen vigils, and journalist-turned-activist Emily Lau. Over the years, the party has long been seen as a moderate opposition party that once maintained friendly relationships even with Beijing officials. Some of its former members had become top government officials, while radical members had criticized the party for being too mild. Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. But following the massive protests that rocked the Chinese territory in 2019, the city’s political environment changed drastically. Months of social unrest triggered Beijing to impose a national security law — which authorities insist is necessary for the city’s stability. Since the law took effect in 2020, dozens of civil society groups have shut down, including the city’s once second-largest pro-democracy party and a decades-old group that organized the annual vigil to commemorate Beijing’s Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. Many leading activists were prosecuted under the law, including members of the Democratic Party. Others were forced into self-exile or silenced. Last year, some of the party’s former lawmakers were convicted and sentenced over their roles in an unofficial primary election in the city’s largest national security case. That verdict drew criticism from foreign governments though Beijing defended it. In recent years, the party has had limited influence over the city’s politics after the authorities overhauled the electoral rules in changes they said ensured that “patriots” administered Hong Kong, and that effectively barred pro-democracy candidates from running for seats in district councils. Despite the changing climate, the party pressed on with its work. It continued holding news briefings on livelihood issues and even submitted opinions on proposed national security legislation to the government before the law was enacted last March. In Thursday’s news conference, Lo said disbandment would require support from 75% of the attending members of a general assembly. The party now has 400 members, but typically not all members attend general meetings. In the past, the party has had both successful and failed attempts to secure enough votes to change its constitution, he said. When the former British colony was returned to China’s rule in 1997, the governing principle of “one country, two systems” was supposed to guarantee Western-style civil liberties and autonomy not enjoyed by mainland Chinese territories. But Lo said his party’s interpretation of this governing principle may differ from that of the Hong Kong government. He said he hoped these different views could remain in society, saying that societies improve only with diverse voices. “The path to democracy is always difficult,” Lo said. “I have confidence in Hong Kongers and Hong Kongers can always find ways to handle different matters.”",Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy party takes initial step toward disbanding,KANIS LEUNG,AP News,2025-02-20T16:30:36,2025-02-20T12:12:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-modi-uk-india-trade-talks-new-delhi/,"LONDON — Just days before the U.K. is set to officially restart trade talks with India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi threw open the doors of parliament for a VIP visitor: former British PM Rishi Sunak. Sunak, who has kept a low-profile since last July’s election defeat, was given the full prime ministerial treatment — touring the halls of parliament, meeting senior ministers and taking the nation’s media by storm, with his visit splashed across New Delhi Television, the Hindustan Times, and the Indian Express. While still prime minister, Sunak failed to land a trade deal with India ahead of the summer election, despite ministers and officials saying Modi’s government was keen to put pen to paper. He refused to make concessions in sensitive areas like social security and visas, instead pushing for a broader, deeper deal.  But now the former British leader, who remains an MP, has been making amends ahead of Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds’ trip next week to officially begin talks. Modi, reunited with Sunak, took to X to call him a “great friend of India,” who is “passionate about even stronger India-U.K. ties.” Sunak, who visited Modi with his family — including his mother-in-law, Sudha Murthy, co-founder of Indian tech giant, Infosys — also met with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Jaishankar posted on X to say it was “nice to meet” Sunak, and he “appreciate[s] his constant support for strengthening relations.” ‘Complex’ talks ahead A U.K. official, granted anonymity to speak candidly, was quick to stress that Sunak wasn’t working on the U.K. government’s behalf. But the official noted it was common for politicians and business leaders to use their personal networks to support and advocate for closer economic ties. They also highlighted that standard protocol would have been followed to support the former PM while traveling.  Meanwhile, Trade Secretary Reynolds is gearing up for his own trip to India. He is due to fly out this Sunday, with Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson also scheduled to arrive early next week. Gustafsson will attend the U.K.-India AI Conference, hosted at the headquarters of Infosys, the Indian tech firm owned by Sunak’s in-laws. A person close to Sunak insisted the former prime minister has no involvement with Infosys and that his meetings weren’t about the free trade agreement. Trade negotiations between the U.K. and India — which kicked off under Boris Johnson in April 2022  — are now back on the agenda under Keir Starmer's Labour government. Speaking to journalists earlier this month, Reynolds was hopeful. “We are committed to the Indian trade deal,” he said. “Obviously no trade negotiation is an easy one [and it is] a particularly complex one with an economy the size of India, but I’m really optimistic about it.”",Rishi Sunak jets in to smooth relations ahead of UK-India trade talks,"Caroline Hug, Dan Bloom",POLITICO,2025-02-20T12:50:43,2025-02-20T13:17:20,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250220-%F0%9F%94%B4-france-returns-sole-military-base-to-ivory-coast,"France on Thursday handed its sole Ivory Coast military base back to its former colony. France has been present in the country for decades, and its departure is in line with a growing trend among African countries to reduce their military ties with France. The French and Ivorian defence ministers signed a document to confirm the return, shortly after the Ivorian flag was raised in the base’s parade ground. Though the handover comes as a spate of France’s former colonies in west Africa weaken ties with their former imperial ruler, both sides stressed that relations remained warm. “This act marks a new era in the friendship and strategic collaboration between our two countries,” Ivorian Defence Minister Tene Birahima Ouattara said. His French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu said that as “the world is changing... it’s obvious that our military relationship should change”. Lecornu hailed the base’s handover as a “historic moment” for the two countries, who share “a relationship built on friendship and a high level of professionalism”. “The presence of France is changing, but not disappearing,” he said. Ouattara also said he wanted to “reassure” France that military cooperation between the two countries would be “as good as it has always been” in the future. A changing of the guard took place at the beginning of the ceremony to mark the transfer of security responsibilities to the Ivorian army. In the last few weeks, around 100 Ivorian paratroopers have also moved into the camp, and joint exercises took place between the two armies. Read more'Time to move on': France faces gradual decline of influence in Africa About 1,000 French soldiers were deployed in Port-Bouet and helped in the fight against jihadists, who launch regular attacks across the wider region. Ivory Coast has remained an anomaly in France’s relationship with Africa, maintaining links with its former colonial master since its independence in 1960, despite a decade of crisis in the 2000s. Elsewhere in the region France is revamping military relations with African nations after the forced departure of its troops from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, where military-led governments hostile to Paris have seized power. In November, Senegal and Chad also announced within hours of each other that they would bring France’s military presence in their countries to an end. Many of those governments have stressed the importance of sovereignty and questioned the need for France’s continued presence in their countries. “The Ivorian authorities know very well that there is support for sovereignty in the country, so the French military departure is something that should happen before it becomes a mainstream demand,” Ivorian political analyst Geoffroy Kouao told AFP. The French withdrawal will take place gradually over the course of 2025, but around 80 French soldiers are expected to remain for training and support missions. “Paris will remain a valued partner in training, intelligence and especially in the fight against terrorism,” Geoffroy Kouao said. The 230-hectare (570-acre) Port-Bouet military camp flanking Ivory Coast’s largest city of Abidjan has been a fixture in the country’s life since 1978 and helped stabilise the world’s top cocoa producer after coups and unrest broke out in the nation after the turn of the millennium. In 2002, following an attempted coup against then-president Laurent Gbagbo and the takeover of part of the country by rebels, France put in place the Licorne (Unicorn) force to protect French nationals and to try to stabilise the country. In April 2011, this force, alongside the United Nations, carried out bombings on Gbagbo’s residence, after several months of post-election crisis. The mission wound up in 2015.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/02/20/2003832180,"The UN nuclear watchdog chief yesterday visited Japan’s stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, a day after Tokyo approved an energy plan that marks a return to nuclear power. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is monitoring Japan’s efforts to decommission the Fukushima plant after a 2011 earthquake-triggered tsunami killed 18,000 people and set off the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. As IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi arrived in Japan on Tuesday, the Cabinet adopted a plan to increase reliance on nuclear power to help meet growing energy demand from artificial intelligence (AI) and microchip factories. “At a moment where Japan is embarking on a gradual return to nuclear energy in its national energy mix, it is important that this is also done in complete safety and with the confidence of the society,” Grossi said after meeting Japan’s foreign minister. Japan had previously vowed to “reduce reliance on nuclear power as much as possible.” However, the pledge was dropped from the latest Strategic Energy Plan — which includes an intention to make renewables the country’s top power source by 2040. Under the plan, nuclear power would account for about 20 percent of Japan’s energy supply by 2040, up from 5.6 percent in 2022. The shift back to nuclear power comes as Japan contends with how to remove about 880 tonnes of radioactive debris from the Fukushima Dai-ichi reactors. So far, only one tiny sample has been retrieved by a robotic claw. Grossi, making his fifth visit to Fukushima, viewed the vast “interim” contaminated soil storage facilities near the plant for the first time. About 13 million cubic meters of soil — enough to fill 10 stadiums — was scraped from the region to remove radiation. About 300,000m3 of ash from incinerated organic material is also being stored. Reporters yesterday saw trucks and construction vehicles going back and forth between several spots where hundreds of large soil-filled black bags were stacked. Japan plans to recycle about 75 percent of the soil — the portion with low radioactivity — for building projects such as road and railway embankments. The remaining material would be disposed of outside the Fukushima region ahead of a 2045 deadline. “In terms of the timing, which has been, of course, set by law for 2045, we believe that it is not unrealistic. It can be done,” Grossi told reporters yesterday.",IAEA official visits Fukushima; Japan revives nuclear power,"AFP, FUKUSHIMA DAI-ICHI NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, Japan",台北時報,2025-02-20T00:00:00,2025-02-19T23:40:13,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250219004300315,"SEOUL, Feb. 19 (Yonhap) -- One of the two North Korean soldiers captured by Ukraine has expressed his wish to go to South Korea, a news report said Wednesday, in what would be the first known case for a North Korean captive to voice an intent to defect to the South. A North Korean solider, identified only by his surname Ri, said in an interview with the Chosun Ilbo that he never knew he would engage in combat against Ukraine as he was told that he would be sent to Russia for training as an overseas student. ""I have made up my mind 80 percent ... Above all, I will seek refuge and am thinking about going to the Republic of Korea (ROK). If I apply for asylum, would they take me?"" Ri said, when asked about his plan for the future. Ri is one of the two wounded North Korean soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces last month during combat against Ukraine in Russia's Kursk region. It marked the first time that a North Korean solider captured by Ukraine has expressed an intent to defect to South Korea since North Korea sent around 11,000 troops to support Russia in its war against Ukraine. Ri, born in 1999 and served as a scout sniper in North Korea, said he belongs to the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North's intelligence agency. ""(Officials from the North's state security ministry) said pilots of the Ukrainian military's drones are all ROK soldiers,"" Ri said, adding that he engaged in combat with Ukraine while believing he was fighting against South Korean troops. Ri, who sustained serious wounds to his jaw and arm, said almost all his comrades from a military unit were killed due to Ukraine's drones and artillery attacks. He also said he could have tried to blow himself up if he had a grenade because being held prisoner in North Korea amounts to a betrayal. As a North Korean solider captured by Ukraine has expressed his wish to defect, what draws attention will be whether the South Korean government would kick off consultations with Ukraine over the issue. South Korea's Constitution stipulates that the entire Korean Peninsula is defined as its territory, effectively recognizing all residents on the peninsula as its nationals. ""As North Korean soldiers are our nationals according to the Constitution, (the government) plans to hold discussions with Ukraine if they request defection to South Korea,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Lee Jae-woong told a press briefing last month. The National Intelligence Service, Seoul's spy agency, also cast a similar stance during a parliamentary session in January that what intent North Korean prisoners have is very important. But it remains unknown whether the process to bring such North Korean captives to South Korea would be smooth, as the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War (POWs) stipulates that POWs shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities. Some experts, however, argue that the North's case may be an exception to such a repatriation duty in accordance with the 2020 commentary by the International Committee of the Red Cross, given that Ri could face a ""real risk"" of serious human rights violations if he is sent back to North Korea. sooyeon@yna.co.kr(END)",1 of 2 N.

https://www.jpost.com/international/article-842904,"“We are not daunted. We will not be deterred. We will speak in defense of our national interests.” These words from South African PresidentCyril Ramaphosa’s February 6 State of a Nation Address illustrate Pretoria’s defiance in a rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape. His country is at the center of global controversy: accused of human rights violations by the Trump administration, leading a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), defending Russia, strengthening ties with China, and reportedly taking Iranian money. The big question: what actually guidesSouth Africa’s foreign policy? Conviction, strategy, or cold, hard cash? JPost Videos South Africa insists it is a non-aligned democracy, yet its actions suggest otherwise. Particularly in its decision to partner with Iranian and Qatari-funded legal teams to prosecute Israel at the ICJ – drawing ire from Washington. “When you side with terrorists at an international body also used by dictatorships and tyrannies to target the US and deflect attention from their own misdeeds, you’re not a moral superpower. You’re on the wrong side of morality,” says Joel Pollak, a South African-American senior editor at the conservative-leaning media outlet Breitbart News. Meanwhile, US-South Africa tensions are escalating. PresidentDonald Trumphas threatened to cut aid, citing land reform policies denounced as “racist” by white farmers and the White House. He has also slapped new tariffs on Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – the BRICS nations – warning them against ditching the US dollar – rattling investors. “There are American investors who are very unhappy with what South Africa is doing, which affects not just land but all property rights,” notes Pollak, who is also poised to become Trump’s new envoy to the African country. Pretoria may also risk losing access to its trade benefits under the US African Growth and Opportunity Act, which drives billions into its economy. South Africa’s drift toward China and Russia is further alienating Washington. Still, South Africa remains America’s largest trading partner on the continent. Pollak warns that warming up to anti-Western states could jeopardize that. “The US wouldn’t notice if trade with South Africa disappeared. It does not need rare earth minerals anymore from them when it has begun discovering them at home.” South Africa didn’t have to look far for another ally – Iran came to them. Vuyolwethu Mkhuseli Xulu, a South African social science strategist and ANC member, explains: “Iran has been seeking legitimacy. Even among Arab nations, it’s an outlier. South Africa, with its Mandela legacy, gives it credibility.” Pretoria’s growing relations with Iran are transparent: it praises Tehran for supporting its ICJ case, condemns Israeli strikes on Iran, and ignores its military and nuclear expansion. Behind closed doors, Iran’s influence runs even deeper. “A lot of business dealings are happening between South Africa and Iran, who many see for its historic opposition to Apartheid’s Western backers. However, reveals Xulu, “many ANC constituents aren’t even aware of these deals because they have become a top-down transaction.” Considering South Africa’s crippling energy crisis, oil-centric Tehran should be an obvious trade partner – but Xulu highlights contradictions here as well. “We thought closer ties with Iran were about energy security, but we’re not investing in green energy. Iran’s crude oil doesn’t align with our government’s supposed push for sustainability.” For him, the real motive is ANC survival. “The party is being opportunistic. They need capital,” he says, pointing to the significant loss of its outright majority, for the first time since the fall of Apartheid, now ruling only through a coalition. “They know they are losing support even from within the movement.” “There was a huge internal fight over the ICJ case and our assumed neutrality” posits Xulu, who is also a research fellow at ISGAP, which exposed Iranian and Qatari funding behind the court’s probe. He notes the hypocrisy of his party “who once distrusted these institutions, now championing them” but maintains that it is a double-edged sword as “ANC leaders are now suspending or removing members who push back.” Contrary to popular belief, China’s relationship with South Africa goes beyond economics. Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project, argues: “There’s nothing exceptional about South Africa’s ties with China that prioritizes business over politics. In fact, the ANC and the Chinese Communist Party have one of the strongest party-to-party relationships in Africa.” This diplomatic viewpoint was on display when Beijing not only supported Pretoria’s ICJ case against Israel but also urged a condemnation of its “occupation” of Palestinian territories. Although it reinforced a shared anti-Western stance, it clashed with South Africa’s democratic model. As Olander puts it: “South Africa backs China’s position not because it agrees, but because siding with Beijing costs them nothing politically while winning favor with a UN Security Council power.” Beijing, in turn, uses these alliances to reshape the current world order, offering governing alternatives to Western-led institutions like the World Bank and the IMF through BRICS, the Belt and Road Initiative, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Still, China dominates South Africa’s trade, which accounts for 20% of Beijing’s total trade with the continent. However, unlike poorer African nations, Pretoria is not dependent on Chinese loans. “South Africa doesn’t receive much infrastructure financing nor does it borrow from China – it has other ways to access capital,” says Olander. Pretoria’s edging closer to the Russia-China-Iran axis may appear threatening to Washington. While it could benefit “enormously” from other African nations, “severing ties with the US would cause unspeakable economic damage, but South Africa’s political standing in the Global South would surge.” South Africa’s relations with Russia trace back to the Soviet Union’s support for the ANC’s liberation struggle. That historic loyalty lingers, but as Steven Gruzd, head of the Russia-Africa Project at the South African Institute of International Affairs notes: “Russia today is not the Soviet Union, but many ANC members studied there, and those fond memories endure.” Pretoria’s pro-Russian stance is apparent as it refuses to impose sanctions, conducts joint naval drills, abstains on UN Ukraine votes, and parrots Moscow’s NATO proxy war narrative. “Ramaphosa has repeatedly framed Ukraine as a Western-engineered war aimed at undermining Russia. This is in line with Moscow, yet challenges South Africa’s supposed neutrality,” says Gruzd. Unlike its trade surplus with America, South Africa runs a deficit with Russia, which is pushing its own currency in BRICS as a challenge to US hegemony. While Pretoria echoes Moscow’s anti-West rhetoric, Gruzd warns that its lack of economic clout and desperate attempts to balance conflicting alliances, means it remains solely as another pawn on Russia’s global chessboard. All four experts agree on South Africa’s foreign policy leanings. It is not binary but rather a mixture of principle, pragmatism, and pay-to-play – no different from any other member of the G20 or, more broadly, any other nation in the international community, they argue. However, US patience is wearing thin, and Pretoria may soon face a reckoning: ideology or economic survival?For Israel, South Africa is no longer merely a critic – it has become a legal adversary on the world stage. Whether Pretoria’s balancing act will secure its long-term interests or lead to isolation remains to be seen.","Iran, Russia, China: why South Africa is choosing new friends",BATYA LEVINTHAL,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-19T18:38:06,2025-02-20T04:58:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250220003300320,"SEOUL, Feb. 20 (Yonhap) -- South Korean Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun met with visiting Dutch Economic Minister Dirk Beljaarts in Seoul on Thursday to discuss ways to enhance their countries' bilateral industrial cooperation. The two sides discussed key topics, including cooperation in economic security, supply chains and semiconductors. They also exchanged views on global economic policy trends and the state of bilateral industrial ties, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. The Netherlands is South Korea's second-largest trading partner within the European Union, with bilateral trade reaching US$14.98 billion in 2024. It is also the largest investor in South Korea among EU nations, with cumulative investments totaling $39.9 billion as of September. The two countries maintain strong ties in high-tech industries, such as semiconductors and batteries. Ahn expressed hope for further expansion of technology cooperation through the South Korea-Netherlands joint innovation committee. Additionally, Ahn stressed the importance of continued cooperation between the two governments on export controls and supply chain security. Both sides acknowledged the increasing significance of economic security amid growing global trade uncertainties.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-842893,"In a significant diplomatic development, Hikmet Hajiyev, Assistant to the President ofAzerbaijan, held extensive talks with Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuin Jerusalem on Tuesday, marking what officials describe as a potential ""game-changing moment"" in regional politics. ""Mr. Hajiyev conveyed the greetings of President Ilham Aliyev to Prime Minister Netanyahu,"" the Azerbaijani Embassy in Israel stated, adding that both sides discussed expanding bilateral cooperation and regional developments. The high-level meeting, which comes just 48 hours after Netanyahu's strategic dialoguewith US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, signals growing momentum for Azerbaijan's potential inclusion in the Abraham Accords framework, according to diplomatic sources familiar with the discussions. ""Azerbaijan has been one of Israel's most reliable partners in the Muslim world for three decades,"" a senior Israeli official toldThe Jerusalem Post. ""Their strategic importance to regional security architecture cannot be overstated."" The Atlantic Council, a prominent US think tank, recently emphasized that ""Washington should learn from Israelâ	ms diplomatic and security collaboration with Azerbaijan to bolster its own ties with Baku. Besides being a bulwark against Iran, close relations with Azerbaijan could help the United States gain a stronger foothold among Central Asian countries, with whom Azerbaijan has been developing stronger relations. This would be especially important for the United States, as Central Asia is rich in minerals and energy and is home to the Middle Corridor, a trade route from Asia to Europe that bypasses both Russia and Iran"". The same day, the Assistant to the Azerbaijani President arrived in Jerusalem, Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies published a special Prospective Paper called â	”How to Effectively Engage Azerbaijan in Trumpâ	ms Regional Plans and in Israelâ	ms Interests: Practical Recommendationsâ	”. It points out that Israel and pro-Israel forces in the US should actively advocate for Azerbaijanâ	ms inclusion in American-Israeli regional development, investment, and technology partnerships. Israel is already advancing a trilateral partnership model for Morocco, involving American companies, and plans to extend this approach to Sunni Gulf monarchies and the US in defense, AI, and cybersecurity as part of the Abraham Accords expansion. Azerbaijanâ	ms participation in such initiatives would strengthen the Muslim component of Israelâ	ms regional partnerships. Moreover, this fully aligns with the Trump administrationâ	ms strategy of expanding multilateral cooperation among US allies to reduce Washingtonâ	ms financial burden on regional development and defense projects. The paper highlights a significant obstacle: Section 907, a legislative amendment that has restricted U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan since 1992. ""For the U.S. and Israel to fully leverage Azerbaijan's advantages within the new 'Greater Middle East' architecture, these formal obstacles must be eliminated,"" the report states. Azerbaijan's unique position as a Muslim-majority country with decades-long strategic ties to Israel makes it an attractive partner for expanding the Abraham Accords to Muslim countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, experts say. Several senior officials from Azerbaijanâ	ms Foreign and Economy Ministries have been actively engaged in bilateral relations with Israel for years and could serve as consultants for The Friedman Center for Peace Through Strength and the Abraham Fund as the accords expand. The country has consistently supported Israel during critical periods, including increasing oil exports by 55% during the recent conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah. The timing of Hajiyev's visit, coinciding with renewed US-Israeli coordination on Iran's nuclear program, underscores Azerbaijan's strategic significance. Both Israel and Azerbaijan view the Iranian regime as an existential threat, making their security cooperation particularly valuable in the current geopolitical context. As the Trump administration seeks to reshape regional alliances, Azerbaijan's role in facilitating Israel's integration into the ""Greater Middle East"" could prove crucial, particularly in expanding security and economic cooperation with other Muslim nations.","Azerbaijan’s top adviser meets Netanyahu, sparking Abraham Accords talk",JERUSALEM POST STAFF,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-19T22:07:42,2025-02-19T22:07:42,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/02/20/2003832176,"Taiwan has blacklisted two Chinese universities from conducting academic exchange programs in the nation after reports that the institutes are arms of Beijing’s United Front Work Department, Minister of Education Cheng Ying-yao (鄭英耀) said in an exclusive interview with the Chinese-language  Liberty Times (the Taipei Times’ sister paper) published yesterday. China’s Huaqiao University in Xiamen and Quanzhou, as well as Jinan University in Guangzhou, which have 600 and 1,500 Taiwanese on their rolls respectively, are under direct control of the Chinese government’s political warfare branch, Cheng said, citing reports by national security officials. A comprehensive ban on Taiwanese institutions collaborating or facilitating programs with the two Chinese universities would be announced at an annual meeting with Taiwanese college and university deans, he said. The prohibition would apply to public and private high schools, colleges and universities, and their vocational equivalents nationwide, he said. Any institution that contravenes the order would have their government subsidies withdrawn, Cheng said in reference to private education providers not subordinate to the Ministry of Education. The measure is necessary to prevent China from systematically targeting Taiwanese students with its “united front” work, he said, adding that education providers have an obligation to protect national security. Taiwanese have a constitutional right to education, but the two Chinese universities do not serve an educational role, as shown by the United Front Work Department’s involvement in their affairs, he said. Taiwanese colleges and universities are already forbidden from collaborating with education providers run by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, Cheng said. The Ministry of Education’s authority applies only to the administration of high schools, colleges and universities, not students, who are free to attend any institution they want, he said. The two Chinese universities are continuing their efforts to recruit Taiwanese high-school graduates following the conclusion of this year’s national college entrance examinations, a source said on condition of anonymity. Separately, in July last year, education authorities warned about the risks of participating in Chinese academic events after the Mainland Affairs Council raised its travel advisory for China to “orange.” A source familiar with Huaqiao University said that the institution has “extremely low standards” for Taiwanese applicants and that its graduate programs have a fixed quota for students from Taiwan. Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) caucus whip Fu Kun-chi (傅?萁) studied law at Huaqiao University, the source added. On Tuesday, Taiwanese rapper Chen Po-yuan (陳柏源), who attended Huaqiao University, said that professors there taught “Xi Jinping thought” and criticized the US. “When I applied through a special program [to enroll], Huaqiao University would take any Taiwanese applicant, even if they had not graduated from high school,” said Chen, whose stage name is Mannam PYC (閩南狼).",Taiwan blacklists two Chinese schools,Rachel Lin and Jonathan Chin,Taipei Times,2025-02-20T00:00:00,2025-02-19T23:40:13,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250220001200315,"SEOUL, Feb. 20 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Thursday denounced the United States for bolstering another ""nuclear alliance"" in the Asia-Pacific region over Australia's move to introduce nuclear-powered submarines from Washington via the AUKUS security partnership. The North's condemnation came as Australia has made its first payment of US$500 million to the United States over its plan to buy Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines under the trilateral AUKUS security partnership also involving Britain. ""This is not a just financial transaction, but it is the activation of another nuclear alliance led by the U.S. in earnest,"" the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in its commentary. ""The move is a dangerous attempt to further worsen the political and military environment in the Asia-Pacific region that has already remained unstable."" North Korea also claimed the U.S. would be able to build multilayers of a nuclear siege against its enemies in the region if it fully creates a ""nuclear alliance"" called AUKUS on top of Washington's similar trilateral partnership scheme with South Korea and Japan. ""The U.S. should contemplate what consequences its military adventurism that will bring a nuclear cloud to the Asia-Pacific region would be,"" the KCNA noted. North Korea has vowed to bolster its nuclear forces since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. At a year-end party meeting in December, the North pledged to take the ""toughest"" counteraction strategy against Washington.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rndygqll7o,"In a room at the luxury Decápolis Hotel in Panama City, two girls hold a piece of paper to the window with a written message. ""Please help us,"" it reads. The hotel offers its clients rooms with sea views, has two exclusive restaurants, a swimming pool, a spa and private transportation. But it has now become a ""temporary custody"" centre housing 299 undocumented migrants deported from the US, the Panamanian government said on Tuesday. Some migrants raise their arms and cross them at the wrists to indicate that they are deprived of their freedom. Others hang small signs with other messages such as: ""We are not safe in our country."" The Trump administration has pledged to deport millions of people who crossed illegally into the US. Those in the Panama City hotel arrived on three flights last week, after President José Raúl Mulino agreed that Panama would become a ""bridge"" country for deportees. However, of the 299 undocumented migrants - from India, China, Uzbekistan, Iran, Vietnam, Turkey, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka - only 171 have agreed to return to their countries of origin. The remainder now face an uncertain future, and it is the Panamanian authorities who are in control of what happens next. According to the government, this group will be transferred to a camp in the province of Darién, which has temporarily housed migrants crossing the jungle en route to the US. On a normal day, tourists can enter and leave the Decápolis Hotel with ease, but now heavily armed members of the Panamanian National Aeronaval Service enforce strict security measures inside and outside of the building. From the street, laundry can be seen hanging in a window. One of the items is a yellow Los Angeles Lakers basketball jersey with the number 24, worn by the legendary player Kobe Bryant. In another window, a group of adults and three children raise their arms with their thumbs in their palms - the international symbol for those needing assistance. ""Help us,"" is written in red letters on the glass. And two children with their faces covered hold up sheets of paper against the glass with the message: ""Please save the Afghan girls."" An Iranian woman who has lived in Panama for a number of years told the BBC she was in contact with one of the migrants inside the hotel. She said they were ""terrified"" of the possibility of being returned to Iran. The woman, who asked not to be named, said she went to the hotel to offer her help as a Farsi translator but was told they already had one. She added, however, that people inside the hotel said that was not true. Using a hidden mobile phone, since contact with those outside of the Decápolis Hotel is reportedly not allowed, the Iranian woman said the migrant told her there were several children in the hotel, that they have been denied a lawyer and that they are not allowed to leave their rooms even to eat. After the story of the deportees being held at the hotel was first reported on Tuesday, the security measures put in place were tightened and migrants' access to the internet was cut off, the woman said. The BBC contacted both the Decápolis Hotel and the Panamanian government to ask about the conditions inside the building, but did not receive a response. However, Panama's Minister of Public Security Frank Ábrego said migrants are not allowed to leave the hotel because his government must guarantee the safety and peace of Panamanians. A video posted on social media on the weekend showed one of the migrants describing in Farsi how they had been detained after crossing the border to the US and told that they would be taken to Texas, but ended up in Panama. The woman in the video said her life would be in danger if she returned to Iran because of possible reprisals of the government. Her intention, she said, is to ask for political asylum. Analysts say this is difficult to obtain without access to a lawyer - even more so when the Panamanian government announced that this access would not be offered to deportees. Minister Ábrego said on Tuesday that the migrants would remain temporarily in Panama under the protection of the country's authorities. ""What we agreed with the US government is that they are here and will remain in our temporary custody for their protection,"" he said. He also warned that those migrants who did not wish to return to their country of origin would have to choose a third country. In that case, he said, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would be responsible for their repatriation. An IOM spokesperson told the BBC that the organisation is in charge of ""providing essential support"" to people deported from the US. ""We are working with local officials to help those affected, supporting the voluntary return of those who request it and identifying safe alternatives for others,"" he said. ""While we have no direct involvement in the detention or restriction of movement of persons, we are committed to ensuring that all migrants are treated with dignity and in accordance with international standards,"" he said. Ábrego also said the migrants were being housed in the Decápolis Hotel because of its capacity to receive them. Another senior official said ""the arrival of more migrants is not expected"" because no more flights of this type have been agreed with the US. Panama agreed to be a ""bridge"" country for deportations after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited the country as tensions simmered over Trump's threats to ""recover"" sovereignty of the Panama Canal. Muzaffar Chishti, a senior researcher at the Migration Policy Institute - a think tank in the US - said many of the deportees come from nations not open to accepting the return of nationals deported from the US. ""That implies constant diplomatic negotiations with those governments,"" he told the BBC. ""By sending them to Panama, the US is out of the picture,"" he added. ""It is a headache for Panama to take charge of those negotiations and see how to get those countries to agree to receive them again."" This week, a flight carrying deportees from the US is expected to arrive in Costa Rica, another Central American country that has agreed with Washington to become a ""bridge"" nation for deportees.

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-europe-major-plan-industry-clean-industrial-deal-climate-targets-donald-trump/,"BRUSSELS —
The European Commission is planning to introduce “made-in-EU” quotas and carbon product labels as it tries to revive ailing manufacturers while hitting climate targets.

The proposals are laid out in a draft of the Commission's Clean Industrial Deal, obtained by POLITICO ahead of its Feb. 26 unveiling. The document offers the European Union executive’s grand strategy for weaving together the bloc’s efforts to decarbonize and revitalize its heavy industry, setting out the steps it plans to take in the coming years.

The plan lands at a precarious political moment. European manufacturers in sectors such as steel and cement say excessive bureaucracy and high energy costs are leaving them unable to compete with the United States and China. Exacerbating the problem, both Washington and Beijing are spending lavishly on their companies, with new President Donald Trump in particular employing “buy American” rhetoric.
Now, the EU wants to inject a dose of “buy European” into its own climate efforts.
Bringing it back home
The EU executive’s strategy encompasses six pillars: lowering energy prices, creating demand, spurring investment, ensuring access to key materials, working on global partnerships and reskilling workers.

The goal: “Present European industry with a stronger business case for large climate-neutral investments in energy-intensive industries and clean tech.”

The draft places demand-stimulating measures for “made in Europe” climate-friendly goods at the heart of the Clean Industrial Deal, reaffirming an existing goal to make 40 percent of the EU’s key clean technology components within the bloc.

To that end, the Commission wants to set quotas to ensure governments and other public authorities purchase such goods.

The Clean Industrial Deal envisions both “minimum local content requirements” and “resilience and sustainability criteria,” all set by legislation to come later this year. It also says the Commission will revise the EU’s public procurement rules in 2026 to “make European preference criteria a structural feature” for “strategic sectors.”

The rules won’t just apply to public contracts.

“These criteria will also be extended to incentivize private procurement, through measures such as life cycle-based CO2 emission performance standards,” the draft adds.

Another idea in the plan is new product labels for industrial goods to show how much planet-warming carbon dioxide was emitted in the manufacturing process.

In legislation later this year, the Commission promises to develop such labels — which will remain voluntary — for specific sectors, starting with steel “in the interest of speed.” This will not entail additional bureaucratic burdens for industry, the draft stresses, with the label derived from existing carbon market data.

Another key part of the strategy is to lower energy prices and boost the rollout of cheaper green energy to replace fossil fuels.

The draft recommends the EU electrify 32 percent of its economy by 2030, up from 23 percent today, and calls for 100 gigawatts of new renewable electricity capacity each year by the same date. As part of this effort, it suggests new legislation accelerating renewable energy permits.
Many of the energy-related measures — including promises of fresh guidance on easing energy taxes and a legal package on electrical grids — are also addressed in an accompanying document, the ""Action Plan for Affordable Energy,"" also obtained by POLITICO.

The EU executive will ask the European Investment Bank, the EU’s lending arm, to help ease up-front investments in needed power grid components and to back long-term industrial energy contracts — though the amount of EIB backing is still undefined in the draft.

The draft also promises “short-term relief … to improve the business case for EU-made clean manufacturing.” The plan says the EU will put money behind the effort, but the amount is left unclear.

On state aid, the document promises simpler rules and separate support programs for specific technologies such as wind and solar, as well as help for clean-tech manufacturing such as batteries.

Another subject in the plan is critical raw materials — the building blocks of energy-efficient and digital technologies. The Commission plans to set up a dedicated ""EU critical raw material centre"" to ""jointly purchase raw materials"" for groups of companies.

It also wants measures to recycle more of these materials and limit exports of raw material waste.
On trade, the Commission proposes to “substantially simplify” its new carbon border tax to reduce bureaucratic burdens, and to look into expanding the measure through a revision this year, followed by a legislative proposal next year.

Plus, it vows that new “Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships” — a mix of regulatory cooperation and financial support “to develop strategic clean value chains with partners” — will “complement” the EU’s free trade agreements with other countries.

The 22-page draft dedicates less than two pages to skills and social issues, focusing mainly on ensuring that industry has access to a skilled workforce.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cre8expj2leo,"Ireland's goods exports to the United States surged by 34% to €72.6bn (£60.4bn) in 2024 while its imports from the US fell slightly to €22.5bn (£18.7bn). That meant Ireland had a goods-trade surplus with the US of just over €50bn (£41.6bn), according to the data from Ireland's Central Statistics Office (CSO). These trade patterns have gained political significance since Donald Trump regained the US presidency. He regards countries which have big trade surpluses as taking advantage of the US. Last week he launched his ""fair and reciprocal"" plan for trade which could pave the way to large tariffs, or import taxes, on goods from many countries. Trump mentioned Canada, Taiwan and India as well as describing the EU as being ""absolutely brutal on trade"". So far Trump has not given any indication that he would seek to single Ireland out among EU countries. Trade policy in the EU is what is known as an ""exclusive competence"" meaning that only the EU can negotiate trade deals and impose tariffs, rather than individual states. The major reason for Ireland's trade surplus with the US is the presence of pharmaceutical manufacturers who export most of their Irish output to the US. The CSO said that in 2024 overall exports of medical and pharmaceutical products rose by 22.4bn or 29% to just under €100bn (£83.1bn). These products accounted for 45% of all Irish goods exports. One likely factor for the increase in exports in 2024 is that Eli Lily manufactures its weight loss drug, Zepbound, at a facility in County Cork. US pharma companies are in Ireland partially because of the country's low corporation tax rate. The researcher Brad Setser, who works for the US Council on Foreign Relations, has tracked the activities of the pharmaceutical companies. In 2023, in evidence to the US Congress finance committee, he said: ""There is no plausible explanation for the current scale of US imports of pharmaceuticals from Belgium, Ireland, Switzerland, and Singapore that isn't tied to tax avoidance.""",Irish goods exports to US surge by 34%,John Campbell,BBC News,2025-02-17T07:53:47,2025-02-17T07:53:47,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/brazil-oil-opec-cop30-lula-3437780649f1d02bb041bd786131062e,"BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazil’s government on Tuesday approved joining OPEC+, a group of major oil-exporting nations, signaling the country’s evolution into a major oil state just nine months ahead of hosting the United Nations’ annual climate summit. The National Council for Energy Policy’s approval came in response to an official invitation in 2023. The group includes the 12 members of OPEC, the longstanding group set up to coordinate oil production to stabilize markets, plus 10 more significant oil-producing nations with Russia by far the largest. Though non-OPEC members agree to cooperate with OPEC nations, Brazil won’t have any binding obligation such as production cuts, Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira said at a news conference. The participation will be limited to the Charter of Cooperation, a permanent forum for OPEC and OPEC+ countries to discuss industry-related issues. The South American country will not participate in decisions. Silveira called the charter merely “a forum for discussing strategies among oil-producing countries. We should not be ashamed of being oil producers. Brazil needs to grow, develop and create income and jobs.” President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva began his third term in 2023 touting himself as an environmental defender, and has worked to reduce deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and to protect Indigenous rights. But he has also argued that new oil revenues could finance a transition to green energy. In recent weeks, he has pressed the country’s environmental regulator to approve exploratory drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River, one of the most biodiverse regions of the world. Brazil is the world’s seventh-largest oil producer, with about 4.3 million barrels daily, or 4% of the world´s output, according to Energy Information Administration, a U.S. government agency. In 2024, crude oil became the country´s top export product, accounting for 13.3% of Brazil’s foreign sales, surpassing soy. The U..S. is the world’s largest producer at nearly 22 million barrels daily, with Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, at about 11 million barrels. Brazil´s move is “comprehensive and coherent,” said Luís Eduardo Duque Dutra, an oil expert and a professor in the chemistry department at the Federal University of Rio Janeiro. He noted that, along with OPEC+, the energy council also approved the country´s membership in two other bodies, the International Energy Agency and the International Renewable Energy Agency. “This helps keep track of the global situation, matching the country’s growing importance after developing pre-salt (offshore oil) reserves and its wind and solar energy potentials,” he told The Associated Press. He also said Brazil would benefit from relations with the other countries: “In times of trade wars, information is as valuable as gold.” Lula’s pursuit of increased oil production, however, has met criticism as Brazil prepares to host the UN climate summit known as COP30 in November. A central push of the annual climate talks has been to reduce the use of fossil fuels, which when burned releases greenhouse gases that heat the planet. “Brazil’s entrance to any OPEC body is another sign of the government’s setback,” says Suely Araújo, a spokesperson of the Climate Observatory, a network of 133 environmental, civil society and academic groups. Opening up new areas for fossil fuel exploration “indicates that we are choosing solutions from the past in the face of a huge challenge for the present and the future,” Araujo said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o,"Hamas says it will hand over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest people held by the Palestinian armed group. The group's negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the bodies would include those of the Bibas family - Shiri and her young children Kfir and Ariel, who were aged nine months and four years when Hamas kidnapped them during the 7 October 2023 attack. Hamas alleges that the three were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israel has not confirmed this. The children's father Yarden was released by Hamasearlier this month. Al-Hayya said Hamas would also release six living hostages on Saturday – double the number originally planned. In exchange, Israel will free all women and those under the age of 19 arrested since last October and is allowing some rubble-clearing equipment into Gaza through the border with Egypt. In a statement, al-Hayya said the group had agreed ""handing over four bodies of the occupation prisoners on Thursday 20 February, including the bodies of the Bibas family"". Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. Israeli officials have said only that they are gravely concerned for their lives. An Israeli official told Reuters that deceased hostages would undergo identification in Israel before being named. In a statement, the Bibas family said: ""In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson's announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages' remains release phase. ""We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter. ""Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over. Hamas has named two of the six Israelis to be released on Saturday. They are Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who were seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively after they crossed into Gaza on their own. The Israeli government has said both suffered from mental health issues at the time. The families of several hostages have said that their loved ones are among those due to be released on the same day. They are Omer Shem Tov, 22, Eliya Cohen, 27 and Omer Wenkert, 23, who were taken from the Nova Festival on 7 October 2023, and 40-year-old Tal Shoam who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri. Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages. In exchange, Israel agreed to release about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. Talks on progressing to the second phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun. Hamas has said it is ready to release in one go all the hostages due to be freed in phase two of the ceasefire deal with Israel.  But a Hamas spokesman made clear that the offer involving more than 60 remaining hostages was dependent on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an agreement for a permanent end to the war.  Hamas also rejected Israel's demand for its disarmament and removal from Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the talks would begin ""this week"".  He said Israel would ""not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organisation in Gaza"" but that Israel could prolong the ceasefire if discussions were productive. ""If we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement (then) we will make this time-frame work longer,"" Saar said. A total of 73 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - a mixture of Israeli soldiers and civilians both dead and alive. This also includes Thai and Nepalese nationals.  Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. Israel responded with a 15-month military offensive that killed 47,460 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and devastated the coastal enclave.",Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family,Gabriela Pomeroy,BBC News,2025-02-18T10:36:35,2025-02-19T01:29:15,gemini-2.0-flash

Authorities have so far notified 17 generals and 13 field grade officers that they are under investigation over Yoon's short-lived declaration of martial law, according to the ministry report submitted to Rep. Ahn Gyu-back of the main opposition Democratic Party (DP). Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Park An-su, who was appointed as martial law commander, is the highest-ranking service member and the only four-star general to be under investigation. The list also includes five three-star generals -- Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Jeong Jin-pal, who served as deputy martial law commander; Lt. Gen. Won Cheon-hee, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency; Lt. Gen. Yeo In-hyung, former head of the Defense Counterintelligence Command; Lt. Gen. Kwak Jong-keun, former chief of the Army Special Warfare Command; and Lt. Gen. Lee Jin-woo, former head of the Capital Defense Command.

Migrants in the hotel rooms held messages to the windows reading “Help” and “We are not save (sic) in our country.” The migrants hailed from 10 mostly Asian countries, including Iran, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China and others. The U.S. has difficulty deporting directly to some of those countries so Panama is being used as a stopover. Costa Rica was expected to receive a similar flight of third-country deportees on Wednesday. Panama’s Security Minister Frank Abrego said Tuesday the migrants are receiving medical attention and food as part of a migration agreement between Panama and the U.S. The Panamanian government has now agreed to serve as a “bridge” or transit country for deportees, while the U.S. bears all the costs of the operation. The agreement was announced earlier this month after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino, who faces political pressure over Trump’s threats of retaking control of the Panama Canal, announced the arrival of the first of the deportation flights last Thursday. The confinement and legal limbo the deportees face has raised alarm in the Central American country, especially as images spread of migrants peaking through the windows of their rooms on high floors of the hotel and displaying the notes pleading for help. Abrego denied the foreigners are being detained even though they cannot leave the rooms of their hotel, which is being guarded by police. Abrego said that 171 of the 299 deportees have agreed to return voluntarily to their respective countries with help from the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. Refugee Agency. U.N. agencies are talking with the other 128 migrants in an effort to find a destination for them in third countries. Abrego said that one deported Irish citizen has already returned to her country. Those who do not agree to return to their countries will be temporarily held in a facility in the remote Darien province through which hundreds of thousands of migrants have crossed on their journey north in recent years, Abrego said. The Panamanian Ombudsman’s Office was scheduled to provide more details on the deportees’ situation later Tuesday.",Nearly 300 deportees from US held in Panama hotel as officials try to return them to their countries,Juan Zamorano,AP News,2025-02-18T00:30:16,2025-02-18T23:31:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/congo-un-children-killed-bukavu-rebels-0b72da70e3e96b1c100812443fc3201a,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Rwanda-backed rebels appeared to be heading toward a third major city in eastern Congo, residents said Tuesday, as international pressure rose over the M23’s expansion in a mineral-rich region that’s critical for global technology. The M23 rebels on Tuesday attacked all the main Congolese army positions on the road to Butembo, a city of 150,000 people, and the situation was rapidly deteriorating, said Auguste Kombi, a civil society leader in Kitsombiro, a town along the road. “We’re afraid that the enemy will advance to Butembo,” Kombi said. Butembo is about 210 kilometers (130 miles) north of Goma, the city of over 2 million people that the M23 rebels seized last month as about 3,000 people were killed. The advance on Butembo means the rebels are spanning out both north and south of Goma. The rebels this week seized another provincial capital to Goma’s south, Bukavu, near Burundi. The region is rich in gold and coltan, a key mineral for the production of capacitors used in most consumer electronics such as laptops and smartphones. Also Tuesday, the M23 captured the town of Kamanyola, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of Bukavu, after they overcame resistance from the Congolese army in the evening, said Steve Mubalama, a civil society representative in the town. Mubalama expressed fears that the M23 rebels would advance a further 75 kilometers (45 miles) to the south to take the strategic city of Uvira. The M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo’s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, over 1,000 miles away. “We’re worried because we’re in danger of experiencing a situation similar to that in Goma, with the loss of human lives,” said Kambale Nyuliro, a Kitsombiro civil servant. He told the AP that Lubero town, on the way to Butembo, was surrounded on three sides by M23 fighters but still under Congolese army control. “Since the fighting began, the enemy has only advanced,” he said. Analysts have said the rebels are eyeing political power, unlike their brief capture of Goma, a major security and humanitarian hub, in 2012. The rebel-appointed mayor of Goma said Tuesday they would carry out a census, in a sign of their intention to maintain control of the city. And ferry service resumed between Goma and Bukavu, the only way to travel between them for now. Rwanda has accused Congo of enlisting ethnic Hutu fighters responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus. M23 says it’s fighting to protect Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination and wants to transform Congo from a failed state to a modern one. Analysts have called those pretexts for Rwanda’s involvement. On Tuesday, the U.K. Foreign Office summoned the Rwandan ambassador in London and in a statement condemned the rebel gains, calling them “an unacceptable violation of (Congo’s) sovereignty and territorial integrity.” “The government of Rwanda must immediately withdraw all Rwanda Defense Force troops from Congolese territory,” the statement added. There was no immediate comment from Rwanda. Dozens of armed groups have long been active in eastern Congo, displacing more than 6 million people and creating the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. The M23’s latest movement north keeps the rebels not far from Uganda, which on Tuesday said it sent troops into yet another eastern Congo city further to the north, Bunia. Uganda said it was meant to combat violence by armed groups. It has periodically sent troops into Congo in agreement with the government in Kinshasa. Also Tuesday, the U.N. human rights chief accused the Rwanda-backed rebels of killing children and attacking hospitals and warehouses storing humanitarian aid. Volker Türk said in a statement that his office “confirmed cases of summary execution of children by M23 after they entered the city of Bukavu last week. We are also aware that children were in possession of weapons.” He provided no details, but U.N. agencies have previously accused both the rebels and Congolese government forces of recruiting children. The U.N. Human Rights Council this month launched a commission that will investigate atrocities, including rapes and killings akin to “summary executions,” committed by both sides this year.",Residents say Rwanda-backed rebels are advancing on a third city in eastern Congo,Wilson Mcmakin,AP News,2025-02-18T06:55:48,2025-02-18T13:05:30,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/honduras-extradition-treaty-castro-trump-037fe1b75d6d32f47b67a3277abb2797,"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — Honduran President Xiomara Castro on Tuesday reversed course on a decision to end a long-running extradition treaty with the United States after reaching an agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. The reversal came as the Trump administration has struck agreements with a number of Central American nations to receive deported migrants from other nations, often after pressure was applied or offers of support made on other issues. “I announce that I have reached an agreement with the new American administration so that the extradition treaty will continue with the necessary safeguards for the state of Honduras,” Castro wrote in a post on X. Honduras was not a stop on U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s recent Central American tour and while Honduras has continued to receive its own deportees, neither Honduras nor the U.S. have said there is a deal for Honduras to also receive migrants from other nations. In February, Mexico started sending 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to postpone threatened 25% tariffs. Last month, Colombia’s firebrand leftist leader caved in a showdown after Trump threatened steep tariffs and sanctions after the Colombian government said it wouldn’t take deportation flights in U.S. military aircraft. On Tuesday, Honduran Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina said the extradition treaty was part of direct talks with the White House, in which the governments discussed five key issues: migration, military agreements, free trade agreements, investment in trade infrastructure in Honduras and extradition. It wasn’t immediately clear what, if anything, Honduras would get from the agreement. Reina added that the extradition treaty would include “important, normal safeguards,” namely that cases of extradition would not be politicized in any way and based on legal factors. It’s a change of tone from Castro’s administration. In August, Castro said that she would end the treaty after the U.S. ambassador in Honduras questioned a visit of Honduran military officials to Venezuela to meet with officials accused by the State Department of drug trafficking. The comments by the diplomat stroked anger in the Honduran government, which decided to end the treaty. The treaty has seen high-profile crime suspects including Castro’s predecessor former President Juan Orlando Hernández extradited to the U.S. He’s serving a 45-year prison sentence in the U.S. for drug trafficking. Days after Castro announced she was canceling the treaty, her brother-in-law Carlos Zelaya, brother of former President Manuel Zelaya, appeared in a video in which he is seen with several well-known drug traffickers negotiating a bribe. The video fueled anger in many Hondurans, who said that her real reason to end the treaty was to protect her family. Reina said Tuesday the latest decision was important to ensure the democratic integrity of the country’s upcoming elections, a process in which the Honduran military is a guarantor. “We are not here to favor politicians or criminals, but, if in any way, the extradition treaty is used to destabilize the government or elections through an attack on the armed forces, that does concern us,” he said.",Honduran president changes course on vow to end extradition treaty with US,Marlon González,AP News,2025-02-18T22:03:16,2025-02-18T18:03:16,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0n5e1pdz9o,"Donald Trump has taken aim at Ukraine after its President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said it was a ""surprise"" his country had not been invited to talks in Saudi Arabia on ending the war with Russia. Saying he was ""disappointed"" by Ukraine's reaction, he appeared to blame Ukraine for starting the war, saying the country ""could have made a deal"" earlier. A full-scale Russian invasion sparked the war in Ukraine almost three years ago. Earlier on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Riyadh for the first high-level, face-to-face talks between the two countries since the invasion, and agreed to appoint teams to start negotiating the end of the war. Lavrov said his country would not accept peacekeeping forces from Nato countries in Ukraine under any peace deal, a proposal raised at a meeting of European members of Nato in Paris on Monday. European Nato states, who remain committed to supporting Ukraine against Russia, have been smarting at being sidelined by Trump's unilateral peace initiative, which reversed the resolutely pro-Ukraine policy of his predecessor as president, Joe Biden. Following what he referred to as ""the infamous meeting"" - to which Ukraine was not invited either - Zelensky accused the Russian delegation in Riyadh of lying, adding that Russia could not be trusted and ""must be pressured for peace"". Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump was asked by BBC News what his message was to Ukrainians who might feel betrayed. ""I hear that they're upset about not having a seat, well, they've had a seat for three years and a long time before that. This could have been settled very easily,"" he said. ""You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,"" he later added. ""I could have made a deal for Ukraine,"" he said. ""That would have given them almost all of the land, everything, almost all of the land - and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished."" After the meeting in Riyadh, Trump said he was ""much more confident"". ""They were very good,"" he said. ""Russia wants to do something. They want to stop the savage barbarianism."" ""I think I have the power to end this war,"" he added. Trump also criticised the length of time since an election was held in Ukraine, when asked if the US would support Russian demands for one to be held. ""They want a seat at the table, but... wouldn't the people of Ukraine have a say? It's been a long time since we've had an election,"" the president responded. He also claimed Zelensky - who won a five-year term in 2019 - was ""down at 4% approval rating"". Zelensky has remained in office while the country has been under martial law following the onset of the conflict. One opinion poll in December suggested52% of Ukrainians surveyed said they ""trust"" Zelensky. Meanwhile, when asked about the prospect of European countries sending troops to Ukraine, Trump said: ""If they want to do that, that's great, I'm all for it."" However, he added of a potential US deployment of troops: ""We won't have to put any over there because, you know, we're very far away."" After Monday's meeting in Paris, British Prime Minister Sir KeirStarmer said any Ukraine peace deal would require a ""US backstop"" to deter Russiafrom attacking its neighbour again. Sir Keir said a ""US security guarantee was the only way to effectively deter Russia"", and vowed to discuss the ""key elements"" of a peace deal with Trump in Washington next week. Also at the talks in Riyadh were US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, as well as Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev. Stressing that Moscow would not agree to peacekeeping forces from Nato countries in Ukraine under any peace deal, Lavrov said: ""Any appearance by armed forces under some other flag does not change anything. It is of course completely unacceptable."" He said the US and Russia would appoint ambassadors to each other's countries as soon as possible and create conditions to ""restore co-operation in full"". ""It was a very useful conversation. We listened to each other, and we heard each other,"" he said. He reiterated Russia's previous position that any expansion of the Nato defence alliance - and Ukraine joining it - would be a ""direct threat"" to Russia. Rubio for his part said he was ""convinced"" Russia was ""willing to begin to engage in a serious process"" to end the conflict. ""There has to be concessions made by all sides. We're not going to predetermine what those are."" ""Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one"", he added. Rubio said the European Union was going to ""have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed"". On the absence of Ukraine at the meeting, he insisted ""no-one is being sidelined"". ""Everyone involved in that conflict has to be OK with it, it has to be acceptable to them,"" he added. The talks in Paris, which were hastily arranged in response to the apparent rapprochement between Russia and the US under Trump, did not agree a unified position. Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz said discussing sending troops to Ukraine at present was ""completely premature"". Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said he did not intend to send troops while Italy's Giorgia Meloni - the only European leader to attend Trump's inauguration - expressed doubts. She told the meeting in Paris that deploying European troops would be ""the most complex and the least effective"" way of securing peace in Ukraine. Ukraine's leader looked visibly tired and upset when he gave his reaction to the Riyadh meeting during a news conference in Turkey. ""We want everything to be fair and so that nobody decides anything behind our back,"" Zelensky said. ""You cannot make decisions without Ukraine on how to end the war in Ukraine."" He will be alarmed by all the smiles on both American and Russian faces in Riyadh, but he will know that he can do little to change whatever they agree on over his head. The Ukrainian president will also know that his country's chances of resisting - let alone defeating - Russian troops without American help are very slim. Following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine. The conflict burst into all-out war when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Moscow's attempts to take control of the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have taken around one-fifth of Ukraine's territory in the east and south, and have carried out air strikes across the country. Ukraine has retaliated with artillery and drone strikes, as well as a ground offensive against Russia's western Kursk region. Accurate casualty counts are hard to come by but it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured, and millions of Ukrainian civilians have fled as refugees. Additional reporting by George Wright, Gabriela Pomeroy and Vitaliy Shevchenko Waltz had faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed.

https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-us-saudi-arctic-energy-rdif-ukraine-russia-capital/,"Russia and the United States discussed possible cooperation on energy projects in the Arctic at a meeting in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, a top Russian negotiator told POLITICO. Kirill Dmitriev, who heads the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said the economic conversations had been about broad strokes, but that the two sides had discussed some “specific areas of cooperation.” “It was more a general discussion — maybe joint projects in the Arctic. We specifically discussed the Arctic,” Dmitriev said by phone as he boarded a flight home after the talks in Riyadh. The negotiations, which sidelined Ukraine and Europe, have sparked angst and urgency in key European capitals as U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin look set to decide on Ukraine’s future without substantial input from Kyiv or its Western allies. For his part, Trump aims to expand American influence in the Arctic, having repeatedly mused about acquiring Greenland from Denmark — and has refused to rule out using military force or economic coercion to seize control of the massive island with its vast mineral wealth and key strategic location. U.S. oil major ExxonMobil had partnered with Russian state oil major Rosneft to explore for hydrocarbons in the high Arctic, but pulled out in 2018 following the imposition of Western sanctions in response to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Dmitriev was part of a Russian delegation that included Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov and was in Saudi Arabia for initial discissions on Ukraine. Tuesday’s talks were the first contact between officials from the two sides following a call between Trump and Putin last week. He commented on the economic track of the talks, which he described as good, but declined to go into detail on the political discussions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S. delegation, accompanied by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. “Positive after the Biden administration destroyed all of the communication, destroyed all of the discussion,” he said. In further remarks, Dmitriev said he had presented an estimate by the RDIF that U.S. businesses had lost around $300 billion as a result of leaving Russia following Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. “There is an understanding that bad relations between Russia and the U.S. actually cost a lot to American business, and there are ways to have productive cooperation benefit both Russia and the U.S.” he said. “I would not want to have unrealistic expectations for the process going forward, but I think joint investments between Russia and the U.S. are now more likely after this meeting than before,” he added. On next steps, Dmitriev said the two sides had agreed to set up working groups and have regular high-level contacts. No further meetings have yet been scheduled. The RDIF was set up in 2011 to partner with foreign investors on projects in Russia, and later backed a Covid-19 vaccine. The sovereign fund was sidelined following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as foreign investors pulled out or scaled back their exposure to Russia. Shortly before Putin ordered in Russian troops, the RDIF issued a statement calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.",Russia and US eye joint Arctic energy projects after Saudi talks,Douglas Busvine,POLITICO,2025-02-18T13:20:11,2025-02-18T13:39:32,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250218001052315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, Feb. 18 (Yonhap) -- The Constitutional Court decided Tuesday to proceed with its 10th hearing of President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment trial as planned, increasing the likelihood that a ruling could be reached by the end of next month. Yoon had initially requested a postponement of Thursday's 2 p.m. hearing, citing a scheduling conflict with the first preliminary hearing of his criminal trial on insurrection charges. Moon Hyung-bae, the acting court president, rejected the request, noting that the criminal trial hearing was set for 10 a.m. the same day, leaving enough time for both proceedings. Moon also cited other factors, including the need to coordinate the schedules of all parties involved, such as Yoon and the National Assembly's legal teams, the justices, and the witnesses. However, near the end of Tuesday's hearing, the court agreed to push the impeachment hearing to 3 p.m., following a renewed request from Yoon's lawyer Yun Gap-geun, who argued that ""unforeseeable circumstances"" during the criminal trial could cause delays. With the rescheduling, the 10th hearing is expected to conclude around 9 p.m. at the earliest. The court's decision to adhere to its hearing schedule, despite time constraints, suggests the proceedings could conclude soon, potentially paving the way for a verdict by late March on whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. At Tuesday's hearing, the legal representatives of Yoon and the National Assembly summarized their arguments to date. The court also reviewed previously admitted but unexamined evidence. No witnesses testified. The hearing will leave only one additional hearing Thursday before proceedings wrap up, and each side is asked to present their final statements. Impeached Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and Hong Jang-won, former first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service, have been called to testify as witnesses Thursday. Meanwhile, Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the National Police Agency, declined to testify for the third time. The court previously asked prosecutors to forcibly bring in Cho, who refused two previous requests over health issues.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-842691,"Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer will lead the Israeli delegation's negotiations over the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, The Jerusalem Post independently verified on Tuesday evening. Ron Dermer is known for his deep personal and political alignment with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior members of US President Donald Trump's administration, particularly given Dermer served as Israel's Ambassador to Washington during Trump's first term. Dermer was also notably a key part in finalizing the negotiations of the Abraham Accords in 2020. Dermer takes the lead over from Mossad Director David Barnea, who led the negotiations for phase one of the deal. As Herb Keinon wrote in The Jerusalem Post on February 4, ""Dermerâ	ms appointment is clearly no minor bureaucratic reshuffle. Instead, it would inject a stronger political and diplomatic dimension into the talks â	 at least from the Israeli side â	 and reinforce the prime ministerâ	ms direct control over the process."" The timing comes amid the shift from the end of phase one of the negotiations, which largely involved the schedule to release Israeli hostages held by Hamas terrorists, and the beginning of phase two of the negotiations, which largely involves planning for a post-war Gaza. Phase two also will involve more direct talks between Israel and US officials, while phase one was more between Israel and Qatari officials. The timing of this announcement may be in part due to Netanyahu seeking to place Dermer in control during the ongoing negotiations, as he is closer aligned to Netanyahu's goals than either Barnea, or Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) chief Ronen Bar.

The action plan, which was jointly issued by eight government departments, includes measures to step up the development of a slew of next-generation battery technologies and create a small group of leading companies in the field. The hope is that new energy storage solutions can help China increase efficiency in its renewables sector, allowing it to transition away from fossil fuels without making the power grid vulnerable to outages. “It is about energy sovereignty – not only ensuring sufficient energy supplies in anticipation of rising demand due to AI, but also maintaining the autonomy to decide the energy mix, energy partners and energy policies China adopts,” said Liang Yan, a professor of economics at Willamette University in the United States. The policy would also help China meet its “double carbon goals” – namely, reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, Liang added.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-developing-plan-to-rebuild-gaza-as-counter-to-trumps-call-to-depopulate-area/,"CAIRO — Egypt is developing a plan to rebuild Gaza without forcing Palestinians out of the Strip, in a counter to US President Donald Trump’s proposal to depopulate the territory and for Washington to take it over. Egypt’s state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said the proposal calls for establishing “secure areas” within Gaza where Palestinians can live initially while Egyptian and international construction firms remove and rehabilitate the Strip’s infrastructure. Egyptian officials have been discussing the plan with European diplomats as well as with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, according to two Egyptian officials and Arab and Western diplomats. They are also discussing ways to fund the reconstruction, including an international conference on Gaza reconstruction, said one of the Egyptian officials and an Arab diplomat. The officials and diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the proposal is still being negotiated. The plan comes after an international uproar over Trump’s call for the removal of Gaza’s population of some 2 million Palestinians. Trump suggested the United States would take over the Gaza Strip and rebuild it into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” though Palestinians would not be allowed back. Palestinians have widely said they will not leave their homeland, while Egypt, and Jordan, backed by Saudi Arabia, have refused Trump’s calls for them to take in Gaza’s population. Rights groups have widely said the plan amounts to forced expulsion, a potential war crime. European countries have also largely denounced Trump’s plan. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the idea and says Israel is preparing to implement it. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Saudi Arabia on Monday in a tour of the region, has said the United States was up for hearing alternative proposals. “If the Arab countries have a better plan, then that’s great,” Rubio said Thursday on the US radio program “Clay and Buck Show.” Egypt’s Al-Ahram said the proposal is designed to “refute American President Trump’s logic” and counter “any other visions or plans that aim to change the geographic and demographic structure of the Gaza Strip.” Gaza is nearing a critical juncture, with the first phase of a ceasefire with Israel due to run out in early March. Israel and Hamas must still negotiate a second phase meant to bring a release of all remaining hostages held by the terrorists, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a long-term halt to the war. The three-stage ceasefire agreement, reached last month, halted some 15 months of fighting triggered by the group’s October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel, when Hamas-led terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. The deal requires Hamas to release all its hostages, Israel to release thousands of Palestinian security prisoners — including hundreds serving life sentences — and a halt to fighting in the Strip, followed by negotiations for a “sustainable calm” and IDF withdrawal from the enclave. Any reconstruction plan will be impossible to implement without a deal on the second phase, including an agreement on who will govern Gaza in the long term. Israel demands the elimination of Hamas as a political or military force in the territory, and international donors are unlikely to contribute to any rebuilding if Hamas is in charge. Central to Egypt’s proposal is the establishment of a Palestinian administration that is not aligned with either Hamas or the Palestinian Authority to run the Strip and oversee the reconstruction efforts, according to the two Egyptian officials involved in the efforts. It also calls for a Palestinian police force mainly made up of former Palestinian Authority policemen who remained in Gaza after Hamas took over the enclave in 2007, with reinforcement from Egyptian- and Western-trained forces. Asked about the possibility of deploying an outside Arab force in Gaza, one Egyptian official and the Arab diplomat said Arab countries would only agree if there were a “clear path” for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Netanyahu has rejected any Palestinian state as well as any role for Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in governing Gaza, though he has not put forward any clear alternative. Hamas has indicated it is willing to give up power in Gaza. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou told The Associated Press on Sunday that the group has accepted either a Palestinian unity government without Hamas’s participation or a committee of technocrats to run the territory. The Palestinian Authority, which governs pockets of the West Bank, has so far opposed any plans for Gaza that exclude it. The Western diplomat said France and Germany have backed the idea of Arab countries developing a counterproposal to Trump’s plan, and that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi discussed his government’s efforts with the French president in a phone call earlier this month. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty also briefed the German foreign minister and other EU officials on the sidelines of last week’s Munich security conference, one of the Egyptian officials said. Officials from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan will discuss Egypt’s proposal at a gathering in Riyadh this week, before introducing it to the Arab summit later this month, according to the two Egyptian officials and the Arab diplomat. The 16 months of war in Gaza devastated the territory. Around a quarter million housing units have been destroyed or damaged, according to UN estimates. More than 90 percent of the roads and more than 80% of health facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Damage to infrastructure has been estimated at some $30 billion, along with an estimated $16 billion in damage to housing. Egypt’s plan calls for a three-phase reconstruction process that will take up to five years, without removing Palestinians from Gaza, the Egyptian officials said. It designates three “safe zones” within Gaza to relocate Palestinians during an initial six-month “early recovery period.” The zones will be equipped with mobile houses and shelters, with humanitarian aid streaming in. More than two dozen Egyptian and international firms would take part in removing the rubble and rebuilding the strip’s infrastructure. The reconstruction would provide tens of thousands of jobs to Gaza’s population, the officials said. The plan is largely the same as that which Arab countries have been working on for the past year, but Israel has long rejected the idea of giving any role to the PA, leaving many of those proposals dead on arrival. Most critical will be Egypt’s effort to convince Trump to get behind the plan, because if Washington does, it will be easier to get Israel on board as well. Al Arabiya reported that the Egyptian plan will also include a clause requiring various stakeholders to serve as guarantors that Israel will not resume fighting in Gaza for at least 10 years. Jerusalem is likely to resist any limits to its ability to use military force against future threats from Gaza.",Egypt developing plan to rebuild Gaza as counter to Trump’s call to depopulate area,"AP, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-02-18T07:08:49,2025-02-18T07:58:12,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/pope-francis-legacy-death-complex-italy-rome-health/,"ROME — Pope Francis is seriously worried about his health after being hospitalized with severe bronchitis, and is rushing to tie up loose ends ahead of the battle to succeed him. The pope was admitted to a special ward earlier this month in Gemelli Hospital in Rome with a respiratory infection, and he has since been forced to cancel a number of public appearances. It’s the latest health crisis for the 88-year-old pontiff, who had part of a lung removed as a young man and has become increasingly fragile in recent years. The Holy See press office has trickled out continuous updates, and on Monday said the pope’s bronchitis had advanced to a “polymicrobial infection” with a “complex clinical picture.” According to two people familiar with the matter, Francis has been suffering from intense pain and has privately expressed certainty he won’t make it this time. On Sunday, doctors at Gemelli distressed the pope by barring him from delivering his regular morning Angelus sermon, which he has rarely missed, even when hospitalized, said one of the people and a third person. He is now acting entirely on “doctors’ orders,” said one of them.  The pope initially resisted going to hospital but was told in no uncertain terms that he was at risk of dying if he stayed in his room in the Vatican, the second person added. As his health has deteriorated over the last month, Francis has also moved to complete key initiatives and appoint sympathetic figures to key posts, following a progressive-tinted papacy marked by bitter ideological divisions.  Since he became pope in 2013, Francis has aimed to make the Church more inclusive, opening up key roles to women and LGBT+ people. While that has provoked furious reaction from many conservatives, liberals complain that the reforms have been insufficient. Meanwhile, the pope’s efforts to put an end to rampant child abuse by clerics have produced mixed results. Papal succession will be political On Feb. 6, before he was hospitalized, he extended the term of the Italian cardinal Giovanni Battista Re as dean of the College of Cardinals, a role that will oversee some preparations for a potential conclave, the secretive gathering that determines the selection of a new pope. The move, which controversially sidestepped a scheduled vote on the next dean by top cardinals, was intended to ensure that the process plays out according to Francis’s wishes, the people said.  Re, a longtime Vatican operator, is too old to participate in the conclave himself. Nevertheless, he will be a pivotal figure in the behind-closed-doors discussions that often take place before the conclave. That Francis selected him as dean instead of a younger candidate suggests he wanted to keep a friendly face in the role who would defend his legacy, said one of the people. “The run-up to the conclave is more important as that’s where lobbying goes on,” the person said. Ahead of the 2013 conclave that elected him pope, Francis himself reportedly benefitted from the influence of a group of cardinals who were too old to participate in the proceedings but nevertheless held sway over the outcome. Re’s continuation in the role will also see him deliver funeral rites for Francis should he die. The pope has privately joked that Re will be “kinder” to him than other candidates, a second person added. The Holy See’s press office declined to comment. Before his health took a turn for the worse, Francis was navigating a politically sensitive moment. Earlier this month, he issued an extraordinary rebuke of United States Vice President JD Vance’s characterization of Ordo Amoris, a theological concept relating to love that Vance used to justify President Donald Trump’s migrant policy. The papal pushback triggered fury from the White House, raising the prospect of a highly politicized succession battle should Francis die. “They’ve already influenced European politics, they’d have no problem influencing the conclave,” said one close observer of Vatican politics, referring to the Trump administration. “They might be looking for someone less confrontational.” On Saturday, the pontiff also sped up his unprecedented reformist move to appoint a nun, Sister Raffaella Petrini, as the next and first woman governor of Vatican City, announcing that Petrini’s term would begin on March 1. That date was earlier than some expected and triggered unease about his health among allies, according to one high-ranking Church official. However, it might also have been a coincidence: the current governor, Cardinal Fernando Vérgez Alzaga, will turn 80 that day, making him ineligible for the role. Even if Francis survives his latest illness, observers see this as a likely turning point as Francis shifts focus from making headway on reform to locking it in. “He may not die now but of course he eventually will,” said one Vatican official. “We all die — and he’s an 88-year-old man with lung problems.”","Pope Francis, sensing he is close to death, moves to protect his legacy",Ben Munster,POLITICO,2025-02-17T21:56:13,2025-02-18T08:49:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgrgz8271go,"Meta has announced plans to build a 50,000km (31,000 mile) sub-sea cable across the world. The tech giant said Project Waterworth - connecting the US, India, South Africa, Brazil and other regions - will be the world's longest underwater cable project when completed. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has sought to extend its presence in technology beyond social media, including in artificial intelligence (AI) and the infrastructure that supports it. It said its new cable project would provide ""industry-leading connectivity"" to five major continents and help support its AI projects. ""This project will enable greater economic co-operation, facilitate digital inclusion, and open opportunities for technological development in these regions,"" Meta said in a blog post. The cable would be the longest to date that uses a 24 fibre-pair system, giving it a higher capacity, according to the firm. Sub-sea cables have become increasingly important as they provide the means to power a variety of digital services and transfer data worldwide at speed. One regularly-cited statistic suggests more than 95% of the world's internet traffic  is transferred through undersea cables. Telecommunications market research firm TeleGeography says there are currently more than 600 publicly-known sub-sea cable systems worldwide. This includes the 2Africa cable, backed by Meta and mobile network operators such as Orange, Vodafone and China Mobile, which links three continents and spans 45,000km. Tech firms that serve as major providers of web services have invested huge sums in cable infrastructure. Google said in 2024 it would build the first sub-sea cable connecting Africa and Australia, and announced a $1bn investment to boost connectivity to Japan with two new sub-sea cables in the Pacific Ocean. ""Over the past decade there has been a shift in which these cables are increasingly laid by large technology companies,"" Professor Vili Lehdonvirta of the Oxford Internet Institute told the BBC.  He said this is in contrast to the past, where underwater cables were laid and financed by large groups of national telecoms firms, due to their considerable investment needs. Prof Lehdonvirta said this reflects the growing size and position of big tech firms to be able to fund such infrastructure independently - something that ""may be significant to policy makers concerned with concentration in digital markets"". Telecoms and technology industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said it spoke to Meta's ambitions.  ""Meta has shown a strong desire to own more of the connectivity slice,"" he told the BBC. ""This is a further demonstration as it seeks to leapfrog rivals in providing users with an unique experience by tightly integrating hardware, software, platform and its growing aspirations in connectivity,"" he added. The rising importance of sub-sea cables has increased concerns over their vulnerability to attacks or accidents. Following a spate of severed cables, experts have said undersea communications infrastructure is a growing arena for geopolitical tensions and conflict. Nato launched a mission in January to increase surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea after damage to critical undersea cables last year. A UK parliamentary committee recently issued a call for evidence about the UK's resilience in the face of potential disruption.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzy300vlzo,"The US State Department has dropped a statement from its website which stated that Washington does not support Taiwan's independence - a move which has sparked anger in China. China said the revision ""sends a wrong... signal to separatist forces advocating for Taiwan independence"", and asked the US to ""correct its mistakes"". The department's fact sheet on Taiwan-US relations earlier included the phrase ""we do not support Taiwan independence"" - this was removed last week as part of what it said was a ""routine"" update. A US spokesperson was quoted as saying that it remains committed to the ""One China"" policy, it said, where US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than Taiwan. China sees self-governed Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation, although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it. As well as dropping the phrase, the factsheet, which was updated last Thursday, also says the US will support Taiwan's membership in international organisations ""where applicable"". Commenting on the changes, a spokesperson at the American Institute in Taiwan - the US' de facto embassy on the island - told local media that the fact sheet had been ""updated to inform the general public about [the US'] unofficial relationship with Taiwan"". ""We have long stated that we oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side."" On Sunday, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung thanked the US for what he called ""positive, Taiwan-friendly wordings"". But in their regular press conference on Monday, Beijing's foreign ministry slammed the move, calling the revision a ""serious regression"" in the US' stance on Taiwan. ""This sends a wrong and serious signal to separatist forces advocating for Taiwan independence and is another example of the U.S. stubbornly persisting with its wrong policy of using Taiwan to contain China,"" said Chinese spokesperson Guo Jiakun. ""We urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes [and] earnestly adhere to the One China principle.""",China anger as US amends wording on Taiwan independence,Kelly Ng,BBC News,2025-02-17T09:19:30.032Z,2025-02-17T09:19:30.032Z,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4z4w3v5y8o,"Sir Keir Starmer has said any Ukraine peace deal would require a ""US backstop"" to deter Russia from attacking its neighbour again. Speaking after a hastily convened meeting with European leaders in Paris, he said a ""US security guarantee was the only way to effectively deter Russia"", and vowed to discuss the ""key elements"" of a peace deal with US President Donald Trump in Washington next week. The prime minister repeated that he would consider deploying UK troops to Ukraine in the event of a lasting peace agreement. But Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a key Nato ally, said for his part, discussing sending troops to Ukraine at present was ""completely premature"". Sir Keir said Europe would ""have to do more"" to defend the continent in the face of the ""generational"" security challenge Russia posed. He avoided explaining exactly what he meant by a ""backstop"" - but his allies suggest this could involve air support, logistics and intelligence capabilities. The talks at the Élysée Palace were held to discuss concerns over the Trump administration's decision to initiate peace talks with Russia - due to start in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday - alone. Sir Keir was joined by the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, the presidents of the European Council and European Commission, and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Kyiv did not know about talks in Saudi Arabia and would not recognise any agreement made without its involvement. US officials have suggested European nations would be consulted on peace talks with Russia, but not directly involved in them. French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X in the early hours of Tuesday that he had ""just spoken"" with Trump and Zelensky. ""We will work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians. This is the key,"" he said, adding that he ""will continue these discussions in the coming days"". Prior to the meeting, the European leaders had also expressed concern after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was ""unrealistic"" to expect Ukraine would return to its borders before 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. Hegseth downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato - something Sir Keir had said it was on an ""irreversible"" path towards - and said Europe wouldhave to be primarily responsible for guaranteeing its own security going forward. Sir Keir said the US was ""not going to leave Nato"" but that it was ""time to take responsibility for our security, our continent"". Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said transatlantic relations were in a ""new stage"", and that the meeting had confirmed the time had come for ""a much greater ability for Europe to defend itself"". Sir Keir has indicated any troop contributions from the UK would be part of a multinational force to police the border between Ukrainian-held and Russian-held territory. But experts say to do so effectively would be a massive undertaking that would require a large increase in defence spending. Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, said that, unlike UN peacekeeping forces there to observe, if the force being proposed was intended to deter Russian attacks, it would be a ""whole different matter altogether"". ""You need credible, well-armed forces - and you not only need frontline forces, you need back-up forces, and air forces, and so on,"" he told the BBC. ""That's a much bigger ask."" General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, a former Nato commander, said: ""This cannot be a token force, it cannot be something that observes bad behaviour and stands on the sideline."" The former head of the British Army, Lord Dannatt, previously estimated such a force would need around 100,000 troops - with the UK contributing about two-fifths. ""We just haven't got that number available,"" he said on Saturday, adding that getting the military into shape to perform this role would come at a considerable cost. The UK currently spends around 2.3% of its total economic output on defence. The government has committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5%, but has not said when this will be achieved. Sir Keir earlier told reporters that the government would set out a path to meeting the 2.5% commitment once it finishes its strategic defence review. ""Part of my message to our European allies is that we've all got to step up on both capability and on spending and funding,"" he said. ""That includes the UK, which is why I've made that commitment to spend more."" Some European figures have signalled their agreement with this. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Europe had to ""step up"" defence spending and support for Ukraine, as ""Russia is threatening all of Europe now, unfortunately"", while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a ""surge"" in defence spending. No 10 confirmed Sir Keir's trip to Washington earlier on Monday, aftera minister said the UK could serve as a ""bridge"" between the US and Europe. The BBC understands the PM offered to host a follow-up meeting of European leaders following the Washington trip. Poland's Tusk has already indicated his nation would not send troops into Ukraine, but would continue to support it with military, financial and humanitarian aid. UK government sources argue it is ""no surprise"" there was a difference of opinion between leaders, and that not every nation is willing to show their hand quite yet. British diplomats do not believe every nation would need to commit to contributing troops - but some would. And whatever Europe's eventual role, US involvement would still be required. Prof Chalmers said: ""Having significant numbers of Nato troops on Ukrainian soil after a ceasefire would be a failure for Russia, so it's hard for me at this point to see Russia accepting such a presence as a part of the deal."" Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called on Sir Keir to recall Parliament to discuss plans to defend Ukraine. Parliament is currently in recess and is due to reconvene on 24 February. Sir Keir's spokesperson said Parliament would be consulted ""as appropriate"" but this was ""getting ahead of discussions"" with other world leaders. Fighting on the ground in Ukraine continued over the weekend, with at least three civilians killed in Russian strikes on Sunday, according to local authorities. Several areas of Ukraine are under an emergency blackout following attacks on energy infrastructure, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted and destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones on Sunday night.

https://apnews.com/article/china-xi-private-business-economy-jack-ma-7898eb671dc6f7cb817cc6238328ea1b,"BANGKOK (AP) — China’s President Xi Jinping met with private sector business leaders on Monday, offering them assurances that policies regarding the private sector would not change, state media reported, as government officials work to revive an economy disrupted by a pandemic, regulatory crackdowns and a real estate crisis. Among those present was Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who was part of a focus on a crackdown on the tech industry in recent years. Xi told the audience that the Communist Party and the government’s approach towards the private sector has been incorporated into “the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,” which is how the party describes its governance, according to state broadcaster CCTV. “They cannot and will not change,” said Xi. The president also said the government would “sincerely protect the legal rights of private businesses and entrepreneurs, according to the law.” But, “at the same time, we must realize that our country is a socialist country ruled by law, and any type of illegal activities by enterprises cannot avoid investigation and punishment.” The words of assurance were made after Beijing launched a crackdown on the tech sector in 2020 to break down monopolies and implement strict data regulations. One of the most public faces of that crackdown was Ma, who founded e-commerce firm Alibaba in the 1990s and was once China’s richest man. He has kept a low profile with few public appearances in recent years after he publicly criticized China’s regulators and financial systems during a speech in Shanghai. Other business leaders at Monday’s meeting in Beijing were Zeng Yuqun, the chairman of battery developer CATL, Wang Chuanfu, chairman of electric cars manufacturer BYD, and Pony Ma, the CEO of Tencent, which owns WeChat, according to a video of the meeting from state broadcaster CCTV and a state media report. Xi said he hoped private businesses will continue to “get rich first, and then promote common prosperity,” a reference to a program to encourage development and close the wealth gap. Alibaba previously pledged $15.5 billion to the cause, while Tencent pledged $7.7 billion. Earlier on Monday, a two-paragraph report about the meeting which originally had been carried by state media was subsequently deleted. Instead, a search online revealed a shorter state media statement which had cut out the names of those present. A later readout of the meeting carried Xi’s speech, and mentioned the names of some of those present, but not Ma. Ma, one of the wealthiest men in the country, gave a speech in Oct 2020 in which he said regulators were too conservative. The government responded by scuttling his plans for Ant Group ‘s stock market debut. The finance-focused business grew out of Alipay, the popular digital payments system. It then forced Ant Group to restructure, dividing it into multiple independent businesses. Alibaba was also investigated and fined $2.8 billion for breaching antitrust rules. —- AP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report from Beijing.","China's Xi promises policy stability at meeting with business leaders, including Alibaba's Jack Ma",HUIZHONG WU,AP News,2025-02-17T05:38:50,2025-02-17T10:55:51,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250217006600315,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (Yonhap) -- A prominent former South Korean lawmaker on Monday called for the creation of an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and suggested considering the redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea to enhance regional security. Chung Mong-joon, a seven-term conservative politician and honorary chairman of the Seoul-based Asan Institute of Policy Studies, made the remarks, citing the growing security challenges posed by North Korea's nuclear missile threats and the military expansionism of Russia and China. ""South Korea is close to God but too close to China, too close to Russia, and too far from the U.S., and it is a big problem,"" Chung said in a speech during an event at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Washington. Chung quoted the famous phrase, ""Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the U.S.,"" attributed to 19th century Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz, who used it to describe the challenges his country faced at the time from its powerful neighbor. ""The United States and its allies and partners need to show credible resolve to deter North Korean, Chinese and Russian military adventurism,"" Chung said. ""We need an Asian version of NATO."" Chung suggested naming the group the ""Indo-Pacific Treaty Organization (IPTO)."" Chung said it was ""not convincing"" that the U.S. has kept its tactical nuclear weapons away from the Korean Peninsula where the security situation is ""more severe"" than in Europe, despite maintaining around 100 such weapons there. ""The redeployment of some of these weapons to the bases in South Korea needs to be considered,"" he said. Chung went on to suggest that the U.S. and its treaty allies, like South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Thailand, should strengthen minilateral security cooperation, as well as with partners like India and Indonesia. ""This is not about containment or regime change of a sovereign state. It is about ensuring that the sovereignty of all countries in the Indo-Pacific is respected so that we can live free from coercion,"" Chung said. ""It will ensure that we can continue to co-exist, maintain economic relations and avoid all-out war,"" he said. Chung, who led the major South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries, said South Korea has ""much to contribute,"" regarding the U.S. President Donald Trump's interest in cooperating with Seoul on shipbuilding. Monday's event was held as SAIS established a distinguished chair in security studies in Chung's name, funded by his US$7.5 million donation.
