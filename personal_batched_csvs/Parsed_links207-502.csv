https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-oman-3aaca426accb6e450fef6395cc5de909,"MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Iran and the United States will hold more negotiations next week over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Iran’s state-run broadcaster revealed that U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi “briefly spoke” together — the first time the two nations have done that since the Obama administration. Tehran’s declaration that the two sides spoke face-to-face — even if briefly — suggests the negotiations went well even to Iranian state TV, which long has been controlled by hard-liners. In a statement released Saturday afternoon, the White House described the discussions as “very positive and constructive,” while conceding the issues that need to be resolved “are very complicated.” “Special Envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” the White House said. Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday while flying to Miami for a UFC event that the talks are “going okay.” “I can’t tell you because nothing matters until you get it done so I don’t like talking about it but it’s going ok. The Iran situation is going pretty good, I think,” he said. The next round of talks will take place Saturday, April 19, according to the Iranian and American statements. This first round of talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local. The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location in the outskirts of Muscat, Oman’s capital, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff returned to Muscat before disappearing into traffic around a neighborhood that is home to the U.S. Embassy. The stakes of the negotiations couldn’t be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear program if a deal isn’t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Talks took place Saturday afternoon in Oman Associated Press journalists saw a convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff leave the Omani Foreign Ministry on Saturday afternoon and then speed off into the outskirts of Muscat. The convoy went into a compound and a few minutes later, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the “indirect talks” had begun. Afterward, Araghchi described the meeting as constructive to Iranian state TV, with four rounds of messages exchanged during the indirect portion. “Neither we nor the other side are interested in fruitless negotiations — so-called ‘talks for the sake of talks,’ wasting time, or drawn-out, exhausting negotiations,” he said. “Both sides, including the Americans, have said that their goal is also to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time. However, that will certainly not be an easy task.” That the two men spoke face-to-face satisfied a demand of the Americans. Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being “direct.” “I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,” Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. “That doesn’t mean, by the way, that at the margin we’re not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.” He added: “Where our red line will be, there can’t be weaponization of your nuclear capability.” Araghchi, however, sought to downplay the encounter as “a brief initial conversation, greetings and polite exchanges” — likely to avoid drawing the anger of hard-liners in Iran. Badr al-Busaidi, Oman’s foreign minister who shuttled between the two sides, said the countries have a “shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.” “I would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement, which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability,” al-Busaidi wrote on X. “We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal.” Sanctions relief and enrichment remain top issues While the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran’s beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran’s stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%. One thing it won’t do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution — “you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution” — unworkable. Iranians including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have held up what ultimately happened to the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed with his own gun by rebels in the country’s 2011 Arab Spring uprising, as a warning about what can happen when you trust the United States. ___ Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-presidential-election-noboa-luisa-gonzalez-correa-f3914829d739a8db92ea95be1a083415,"QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — In a polarized political landscape, Ecuadorian voters will choose Sunday between an incumbent young millionaire and a leftist lawyer to lead the South American country for the next four years. President Daniel Noboa and leftist challenger Luisa González will face off in a presidential runoff as Ecuadorians once again try to find a solution to the extortions, killings, kidnappings and other crimes that have accompanied them since the country emerged from the pandemic. Noboa and González advanced to the runoff after being the top vote-getters in February’s first-round election. He obtained 44.17% of support while she earned 44%. Sunday’s vote will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency. It will also test the lasting influence of González’s mentor, former President Rafael Correa. Here is what to know ahead of the vote: What’s on voters’ minds? The persistent violence Ecuador began experiencing four years ago. The spike in crime is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Noboa, who took office in November 2023, declared Ecuador to be in a state of “internal armed conflict” in January 2024, allowing him to deploy thousands of soldiers to the streets to combat gangs and to charge people with terrorism counts for alleged ties to organized crime groups. The homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023 to 38.76 per 100,000 people in 2024. But despite the decrease, the rate remained far higher than the 6.85 homicides per 100,000 people seen in 2019. Other crimes, such as kidnapping and extortion, have also skyrocketed, making people fearful of leaving their homes. Some of Noboa’s heavy-handed crime fighting tactics have come under scrutiny inside and outside the country for testing the limits of laws and norms of governing. The crime spike is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Despite their opposing political ideology, both candidates have promised tough-on-crime policies, better equipment for law enforcement and international help to fight cartels and local criminal groups. Voters are also concerned about what is in their wallets. Only 33.7% of working-aged Ecuadorians were formally employed at the end of last year, according to the country’s Institute of Statistics and Census. Noboa, a free-market supporter, has promised to create a million jobs in four years by offering incentives to hire young people and modifying the educational system to improve employment opportunities. González, meanwhile, has said she will create 2 million jobs through a strategy that includes increasing spending in public works projects. Who are the candidates? Noboa, 37, is an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade. He opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father’s Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission. Noboa, like González, was a lawmaker until May 2023, when then-President Guillermo Lasso dissolved the National Assembly, shortening his own mandate as a result and triggering that year’s snap election. Noboa defeated González in the runoff. González, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. She was unknown to most voters until Correa’s party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election. Much of her support comes from people who long for the low crime and unemployment rates of Correa’s presidency but gloss over his authoritarian tendencies, the huge debt he ran up and the corruption-related sentence handed down to him in absentia in 2020. Many people who support Noboa say their vote is more a rejection of Correa’s movement than a resounding endorsement of the president’s performance. Who gets to vote? More than 13 million people are eligible to vote, which is mandatory for adults up to the age of 65. It is optional for people aged 16 and 17 and over 65. Failure to vote results in a fine of $46. Electoral authorities have prohibited voters from taking photos of their ballots during this election. The National Electoral Council said it adopted the measure because criminal groups had coerced many voters. Anyone who violates the prohibition faces a maximum fine of $32,000.

https://www.dw.com/en/gabons-junta-chief-expected-to-win-election-as-polls-open/a-72226389,"Polling centers closed in Gabon on Saturday after a presidential election which junta chief Brice Oligui Nguema is widely expected to win. Oligui Nguema, who led a coup in August 2023 and a month later declared himself transitional president, had been leading in pre-election polls. He campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket. He has also emphasized the need to break from the dynasty of Omar Bongo Ondimba and his son and successor Ali Bongo, who together ruled Gabon for more than 50 years. In the run up to the election — the first to be held in the country since the coup — Oligui Nguema had predicted a ""historic victory."" ""I am very confident. May the best man win,"" he said as he cast his ballot alongside his wife Zita at a school in the center of the Gabonese capital Libreville. His main opponent, Alain Claude ""Bilie"" By Nze, who was prime minister before the coup, has cast himself as the candidate for a ""complete rupture"" with the country's past. He has accused Oligui Nguema, who led the Republican Guard under the Bongos, of continuing their legacy. After casting his ballot, Nze warned reporters of potential ""problems"" during the counting.  Oligui Nguema's main opponent, Bilie By Nze, has hinted at potential fraud""We'll see what it will bring,"" he added. Election monitors at the Citizens Observers Network (ROC) said they were denied access to several voting offices, but Oligui Nguema insisted the election had been ""transparent"" and ""peaceful."" Ballot counting started shortly after 6 pm (5 pm UTC) when most polling centers closed, although some remained open for voters who were still waiting to cast their ballot.  Around 920,000 Gabonese were eligible to vote. The interior ministry said turnout was 87.12%. Initial results are expected to be announced on Sunday. The winner will be handed a seven-year mandate that can be renewed once. Why does the election matter? It is the Sahel nation's first election since the 2023 coup ousted the Bongo dynasty from power.  The election in the former French colony of 2.3 million people comes amid high unemployment, regular power and water shortages and heavy government debt. The small West African country is resource-rich, with significant deposits of petroleum, manganese, and iron ore. Gabon 2025 election: An example for the Sahel nations?

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-it-has-captured-gazas-morag-corridor-cutting-off-rafah-from-khan-younis/,"The IDF announces that it has completed capturing the Morag Corridor in the southern Gaza Strip, cutting off the city of Rafah from Khan Younis. Rafah is now completely surrounded by the military, with the 36th Division holding the Morag Corridor, and the Gaza Division operating in the Philadelphi Corridor, the Egypt-Gaza border area. The 36th Division’s 188th Armored Brigade had pushed into the Morag Corridor from the northwest, while the division’s Golani Infantry Brigade entered from the border in the southeast. Overnight, the two units joined up. Engineering forces are now constructing a road along the corridor, similar to the other corridors in Gaza captured by the IDF during the war. The military will now operate inside areas of Rafah that it has not been in yet to defeat the remaining Hamas forces there. The IDF issued evacuation warnings for civilians in Rafah nearly two weeks ago. Eventually, the IDF’s buffer zone in southern Gaza will stretch from the Egyptian border to the outskirts of Khan Younis — more than 5 kilometers away — and include the entire city of Rafah within it — around 20% of the Strip. The IDF’s buffer zone elsewhere on the border with Gaza has also been expanded from several hundred meters to around 2 kilometers in most areas. Over the past week and a half, during operations in the Morag Corridor area, the IDF says it has eliminated dozens of terror operatives and destroyed Hamas infrastructure, including tunnels.","IDF says it has captured Gaza’s Morag Corridor, cutting off Rafah from Khan Younis",Emanuel Fabian,The Times of Israel,2025-04-12T08:53:28,2025-04-12T08:53:28,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20jr8rjj2o,"Parliament has been recalled for a rare Saturday sitting to pass an emergency law aimed at saving British Steel's Scunthorpe plant from imminent closure. Sir Keir Starmer said the legislation would allow ministers to ""take control"" of the Lincolnshire site and stop its Chinese owner from closing its blast furnaces. The move opens the door to a full nationalisation of the company at a later stage, with the prime minister saying ""all options"" remained on the table. Talks have been taking place this week to keep production going at the firm, after owners Jingye said its blast furnaces were ""no longer financially sustainable"". MPs and peers are currently on their Easter break and were not due to return until 22 April, but both are now going back to Westminster for the hastily convened sitting. Parliament sat on both Saturday and Sunday on the outbreak of World War Two in 1939. And there have been only five occasions since then when it sat on a Saturday, showing the importance the government is placing on the law. Speaking at Downing Street on Friday, Sir Keir said the government wanted to pass the legislation in a single day, adding the future of the company ""hangs in the balance"". He said steelmaking was ""essential for our future"" and that he would always ""act in the national interest to protect British jobs and British workers"". ""Jobs, investment, growth, our economic and national security are all on the line,"" the prime minister said. The BBC understands from a senior government source the emergency legislation being voted on in Parliament on Saturday would not give ministers the power to nationalise British Steel - another bill would be needed to do that. Industry Minister Sarah Jones told BBC Breakfast the preference was for private investment alongside government funding to secure British Steel's future, but there was not currently a company ""that is there willing to invest at this point"". Chinese company Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2020,says it has invested more than Â£1.2bn in the company to maintain operations, but has been suffering financial losses of around Â£700,000 a day. The business department said the new law would give the government powers to order raw materials to keep the site's two running blast furnaces going, with supplies otherwise due to run out in the coming weeks. It added it would also allow ministers to direct the company's board and workforce, and ensure anyone at the plant ""who takes steps to keep it running, against the orders of the Chinese ownership"" can be reinstated if they are sacked. The company announced plans last month to shed jobs at the Scunthorpe site, which employs 2,700 people, blaming ""highly challenging"" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with lower-carbon production techniques. The government has offered Â£500m of support to partly fund a switch from blast furnaces to more energy efficient electric arc furnaces. But the offer has been rejected by the company. Earlier this week, the government offered to buy the coking coalto keep the blast furnaces running until a longer-term solution to saving the plant could be found, but was unable to get the company to agree to this in tense negotiations. Jones said the government believed Jingye had ""not been acting in good faith"" over talks to agree a deal. ""Things have reached an existential point where the company is refusing to bring in the raw materials we need to keep the blast furnaces running,"" she added. The business secretary is thought to have lost confidence in the company's Chinese owners, with a government source saying they are ""no longer trustworthy partners"". A 'Save Scunthorpe Steel' campaign will take place in the town on Saturday, including a parade at half-time during Scunthorpe United FC's match against Spennymoor Town. The football club is nicknamed The Iron, a reference to the town's connection with the steel industry. The move to take control of the company has been welcomed by unions representing employees at the site, with Unite saying it would grant workers a ""reprieve"" while a longer-term solution is worked out. ""Ministers could not have allowed a foundation industry to go under,"" added general secretary Sharon Graham. The GMB union said the government's move looked like the ""first step"" towards nationalisation, which it supported as the ""only way to save the UK steel industry"". Steelworkers' union Community said the government could not allow the UK to become the only country in the G7 group of advanced economies ""without primary steelmaking capacity"". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of having ""bungled"" the negotiations with British Steel. ""They must have seen this coming for a while,"" she added. ""Instead of addressing it earlier in the week when Parliament was sitting, their incompetence has led to a last-minute recall of Parliament."" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the government's plan was just a ""short-term sticking plaster"". He added that his party would try to amend the emergency legislation to nationalise British Steel immediately, calling public ownership ""the only option we have to save this vital strategic asset"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said ""nothing should be off the table in this matter of national security"" and added that the recall of Parliament should be seen as ""an opportunity to come forward with a serious plan for the sustainable future of domestic steel production"". The Green Party of England and Wales said it backed nationalisation as the ""only sure way to secure this strategically important sector"". Parliament was last recalled from a scheduled break in August 2021 to discuss the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Falkland Islands invasion in 1982 and the proposed Brexit deal in 2019 are two other occasions that have merited recalls. The most recent sitting Saturday was 10 September 2022, when the House of Lords reconvened to pay tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II. The House of Commons has been recalled 34 times since 1948.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/12/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1143,"These are the key events on day 1,143 of Russiaâ



 Fighting

Russia’s defence ministry said air defence units destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones within a span of 30 minutes late on Friday. The ministry said that between 10-10:30pm local time (19:00-19:30 GMT), nine drones were destroyed over Russia’s Rostov region on Ukraine’s eastern border, and four in the Kursk region on Ukraine’s northern border.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the site of a deadly Russian attack on his hometown of Kryvyi Rih, one week after a Russian missile strike killed 19 people, including nine children and teenagers.
Ukrainian officials have in recent days sent Washington a list of targets it believes Russia has struck in violation of the energy infrastructure ceasefire that Kyiv and Moscow agreed to last month as part of efforts by the United States to reach a ceasefire.
Military analysts believe Russia is preparing to launch a new military offensive in the coming weeks to ramp up pressure and strengthen the Kremlin’s hand in ceasefire negotiations.







President Zelenskyy said that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting at the Ukraine front line alongside Russian forces, and accused Moscow of dragging Beijing into its invasion of his country. “As of now, we have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia’s occupation forces,” Zelenskyy said.
More than 100 Chinese citizens fighting for the Russian military against Ukraine are mercenaries who do not appear to have a direct link to China’s government, two US officials familiar with American intelligence and a former Western intelligence official told the Reuters news agency. Chinese military officers have, however, been in the theatre of war behind Russia’s lines with Beijing’s approval to draw tactical lessons from the war, officials told Reuters.
Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was ready to purchase additional air defence systems, adding that he discussed it with US President Donald Trump.

 Ceasefire

Talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Russia lasted more than four hours, with no concrete results disclosed. According to Russia’s Interfax news agency, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not rule out the possibility of another phone call between Putin and Trump following the discussions.
Trump said in a post earlier on Truth Social: “Russia has to get moving. Too many people [are] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!”
Russia has rejected a US-backed proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire and appears to be dragging its feet on a more limited truce in the Black Sea agreed last month, analysts said.








German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Friday, after presiding over a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group in Brussels alongside British Defence Secretary John Healey, that “ongoing aggression” from Russia meant “we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future”.
If a ceasefire is not achieved by the end of this month, Trump could impose additional sanctions on Russia, the US news site Axios reported, citing an anonymous source.
Ukraine could be partitioned like Berlin after World War II, President Trump’s envoy to Kyiv, General Keith Kellogg, appeared to suggest as Russia continues to hold out on accepting a truce. In an interview with The Times newspaper, Kellogg said the country could be split into zones of control, with British and French troops as part of a “reassurance force” in the west and Moscow’s forces in the east. Between them would be Ukrainian forces and a demilitarised zone.

 Military Aid

European countries have promised to send billions of dollars in further funding to help Ukraine keep fighting Russia’s invasion. Ukraine’s allies pledged a record 21 billion euros ($23.9bn) of military aid for the country, with the United Kingdom Defence Secretary Healey warning that 2025 was “the critical year” for the war.
Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said that his country is monitoring the world armaments market and sees opportunities for Ukraine’s backers to buy more weapons and ammunition.
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was absent from the Ukraine donor’s forum that the US established and led for several years, although he spoke to the meeting via video.







 Sanctions

A former Russian government minister who violated UK sanctions by receiving financial support from family members was sentenced to more than three years in prison in England. Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, who was appointed governor of Sevastopol in Russian-annexed Crimea by Putin, became the first person convicted of violating the sanctions put in place after the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
Estonia’s navy said it detained an oil tanker believed to belong to Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Gulf of Finland in order to check its papers.

 Regional security

A reduction in the number of US soldiers in Eastern Europe would be seen as Washington moving another step closer to Moscow and a worrying sign for Europeans, according to analysts. The NBC news channel, quoting US and European sources, said this week that the US Department of Defense was looking at the withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Europe.
President Putin announced billions in investments for the rearmament of his country’s navy. “In the next decade, 8.4 trillion roubles [around $97bn] are earmarked for the construction of new boats and ships for the navy,” Putin said at a meeting on navy development in Saint Petersburg, according to Russian news agencies.
Putin said the navy would develop drone and robot technology, and he claimed that 49 warships of various classes have been built in Russian shipyards in the past five years, including nuclear submarines that can be equipped with new Zircon hypersonic missiles.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sharply criticised European Union politicians against the backdrop of a rapprochement between the Kremlin and the new US administration.
Politicians such as acting German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, European Union top diplomat Kaja Kallas and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were not thinking of their voters, but had put the desire to punish Russia above the wellbeing of their own citizens, Lavrov said.

https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/12/erdogan-positions-turkey-as-point-of-stability-for-european-security-and-syria,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has sought to position his country as a point of stability in an increasingly tumultuous world, saying Turkey is essential for European security.Erdoğan also said Turkey is able to span geopolitical divisions over Ukraine, Syria and the recent wave of US tariffs that have sparked a global trade war.The Turkish president, speaking at the annual Antalya Diplomacy Forum, is facing disruption at home from protests against the	imprisonment of his main political rival, Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu.""It has become clear once again that European security is unthinkable without Turkey. Turkey is ready to take responsibility for European security in the future as well,"" he said at the opening of the three-day gathering.As trans-Atlantic relations cool under the Trump administration, NATO member Turkey, which has the alliance’s second-largest military and a well-developed defence industry, is seeking a broader role.The White House has warned that the continent must look after its	own security, including Ukraine, and has so far shown no willingness to back a largely European force in Ukraine in the face of Russian hostility.Turkey has emerged as a key broker in the Black Sea region, preserving relations with both Ukraine and Russia. Erdoğan and Trump have both spoken of their close personal relationship.""I believe that our relations with the United States will flourish in every field during President Trump's second term, also with the contribution of our close friendship with him,"" the Turkish president told an audience of world leaders and diplomats.Turning to Trump's tariffs, Erdoğan held out the chance of a	positive outcome for Turkey, which has been placed within the baseline 10% tariff.""We are doing our best to prevent the heated commercial competition over customs tariffs from becoming destructive,"" Erdoğan said. ""Turkey will be one of the winners of this process.""Turkey is also an influential actor in neighbouring Syria as rebel groups it supported during the civil war took power last December.However, the fall of long-time president Bashar Al-Assad has aggravated already tense relations between Turkey and Israel, with their conflicting interests pushing the relationship toward a	possible collision course.When Trump hosted	Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington last month, he advised him to be ""reasonable"" in his dealings with Ankara.Erdoğan told the forum in Antalya: ""We are in a state of understanding and close dialogue with influential actors in the region, especially Trump and Putin, in preserving the territorial integrity of Syria.""Syria's new President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, sat just two places away from Erdoğan.In an apparent warning, Erdoğan said that ""no-one should misunderstand our cool-headedness and our stance of resolving issues through dialogue.""The president, a vocal critic of Israel's military operations in Gaza, also focused on the killing of civilians in the enclave.""Even if it is at war, does a legitimate state act like this?

https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250411-fears-for-political-stability-as-joseph-kabila-plans-return-to-eastern-drc,"The planned return of former Democratic Republic of Congo president Joseph Kabila from self-imposed exile could shift political dynamics and complicate efforts to resolve escalating violence in the country's east, analysts say. Kabila this week announced his intention to leave South Africa, where he has been exiled since December 2023, and address the deteriorating security situation in eastern DRC. His return comes amid accusations from President Felix Tshisekedi that Kabila supports the AFC rebels responsible for recent military advances, including capturing key cities Bukavu and Goma. “After six years of total silence and given the worsening security situation, I have resolved to return home without delay to help find a solution,” Kabila wrote on Tuesday. ""I have decided to begin with the eastern region, where there is danger at hand."" In recent months, Kabila has been unusually outspoken about the DRC conflict, breaking his usual silence since stepping down in 2019. In February, he authored an opinion piece in South Africa’s Sunday Times, arguing the “DRC crisis needs more than a military solution”. Political analyst Michael Tshibangu told RFI that Kabila’s recent activities signal his intent to become more politically involved. “It is clear that he is stepping up to play a more active political role. But he has not put all his cards on the table. In typical Kabila fashion, he has maintained an element of mystery as to what his real political objectives are,” Tshibangu said. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan arrives in DRC amid escalating eastern conflict Kabila, who is currently writing a thesis at the University of Johannesburg and spending time in Namibia and Zimbabwe, has reportedly held meetings with regional and international figures involved in the conflict. “Kabila met with representatives from Rwanda, Uganda and regional countries. He is trying to position himself as a credible alternative to President Felix Tshisekedi who is not currently enjoying good relations with DRC’s neighbours,” said Fred Bauma, of the Ebuteli research institute. “However, he will really have to convince them of his good will and capacity to be part of the solution. But that's far from being a done deal.” Kabila has also reached out to Congolese opposition politicians exiled in Europe, holding meetings with opposition leaders Moise Katumbi and Claudel Lubaya in Addis Ababa last December. “He is attempting to restructure the political opposition in DRC and may well be positioning himself to take the lead role with the support of various parties,” said Bob Kabamba, political science lecturer at Liege University in Belgium. Tshibangu noted that Kabila's announcement to return comes at a politically sensitive time, as President Tshisekedi appears weakened amid military setbacks. DRC president suggests unity government to respond to the crisis	
in the east Kabila did not specify exactly when or where he intends to arrive in eastern DRC, prompting speculation and caution from observers. “The east of DRC is such a vast territory and he did not say that he will go to the areas controlled by the AFC rebels,” said Tshibangu. Tshisekedi has accused Kabila of sponsoring the AFC rebels, led by Corneille Nangaa, former president of DRC’s independent national electoral commission and an ally of Kabila. Kabila strongly denies these accusations and has publicly challenged Tshisekedi to provide evidence. “This could explain why he prefers not to go to Kinshasa, the capital city, first. Unless the government gives him assurances that he will not be arrested,” Tshibangu said.",Fears for political stability as Joseph Kabila plans return to DRC,Zeenat Hansrod,RFI,2025-04-11T14:57:47,2025-04-16T08:18:35,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250411-coup-leader-favourite-to-win-as-gabon-heads-to-the-polls-hoping-for-change,"Gabon stands at a political crossroads this weekend, as the nation heads to the polls for its first presidential election since the 2023 military coup â



– a vote that could mark a clean break from decades of dynastic rule, or entrench a familiar power under a new guise. As voters prepare to cast their votes on Saturday, the final political rallies across the country this week set the tone for what could be a turning point for the country. The transitional president and favourite to win, Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, ended his campaign a day early with a high-energy double-header of in the capital Libreville on Thursday. Buses rolled into Libreville bringing thousands of enthusiastic supporters, who thronged venues in the Owendo district and along the Boulevard Bessieux, where previous presidential heavyweights such as Ali Bongo and Jean Ping too once drew massive crowds. As Oligui Nguema pulled out all the stops to consolidate his lead, critics have argued that his campaign – under the slogan ""C’BON"", a play on his initials and the French for ""it's good"" – has been saturated with state resources. “It’s déjà vu,” one onlooker told RFI, referring to the fact that some see similarities between



Oligui Nguema's campaign and the Bongo era. Turning the page Gabon is a nation rich in oil yet struggling with inequality and economic mismanagement. For more than 50 years, the country was ruled by the Bongo dynasty



– a reign that for many became synonymous with stagnation, corruption and squandered potential. With Oligui Nguema – himself a cousin of Ali Bongo, who he deposed in the coup of 30 August, 2023 – at the helm of the transition, critics have questioned whether this election truly represents change, or just a new face on the old system. Who are the candidates in Gabon's post-coup presidential election? Oligui Nguema's leading rival, Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nze, has positioned himself as the true reformer, pledging to overhaul public finances, boost youth employment and assert greater independence from France. Speaking to RFI, he pulled no punches: “There is hidden debt, unaccounted domestic and foreign debt… debts incurred to acquire shares in companies."" Decades of debt While the country's debt officially dropped from 71 percent of GDP in 2023 to 67 percent in 2024, it remains a contentious issue. Some analysts, such as Cédric Jiongo of the Sika Finance economic think tank, have criticised the government's “unconventional” accounting methods, which omit significant arrears. Fitch Ratings downgraded Gabon earlier this year, warning of rising deficits and an over-reliance on oil revenue. Gabon approves new constitution a year after military seized power Communications minister Laurence Ndong, however, told RFI: “We found a country with a debt of 7.5 trillion CFA Francs [more than€11 billion]. Today, Gabon is honouring its debt commitments. All our lenders have been repaid."" The transitional government has repaid more than €350 million and pushed through a balanced 2025 budget. But concerns remain. The International Monetary Fund has urged fiscal consolidation, and sceptics argue that splashy investments – such as nationalising oil firms and launching a state airline – are more about optics than sustainability. The transitional government insists this will be “the first free and transparent election” in decades, and



Saturday's vote is being monitored by

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2q323lg3o,"Ukraine's European allies have pledged €21bn ($24bn; £18bn) in a new tranche of military support for Kyiv in what they described as ""a critical year"" for the war. More than half of this - €11bn in aid over four years - is coming from Germany. British Defence Minister John Healey said the pledges would send a strong signal to Moscow. The announcement came as members of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group met at Nato's headquarters in Brussels to pledge air defences, missiles and other gear as Europe sought to fill the gap left by the changed priorities of the US under Donald Trump. Europe's defence ministers said they saw no sign of an end to the war, despite Trump's promise of a ceasefire. Support announced on Friday also includes a £450m ($590m) package from the UK and Norway to fund radar systems, anti-tank mines, vehicle repairs and hundreds of thousands of drones for Ukraine. The money is part of a British pledge of £4.5bn made earlier this year. Air defence was a priority in Brussels. Healey said Russian forces had dropped 10,000 glide bombs on Ukraine in the first three months of this year, as well as launching 100 one-way attack drones a day. ""In our calculations, 70% to 80% of battlefield casualties are now caused and inflicted by drones,"" the UK defence secretary said. The German aid package meanwhile has a significant focus on artillery. Boris Pistorius said Germany would send 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, 25 infantry fighting vehicles, 15 battle tanks, 100 ground surveillance radars and 120 Man-Portable Air Defense Systems. Berlin will also send four IRIS-T air defence systems with 300 missiles to Kyiv. ""Ukraine needs a strong military and only then can the negotiation process lead to a just and lasting peace,"" the German defence minister told reporters in Brussels. Defence ministers from 50 nations gathered in Brussels for the 27th gathering of the UDCG. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth joined the meeting remotely, telling allies that America appreciated their work. Pistorius said Hegseth's decision was a matter of ""schedules"" rather than ""priorities"", and that the ""most important fact was that he took part"". Other leaders also joined remotely, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Kyiv's defence minister Rustem Umerov, who was in Brussels, thanked Europe for ""taking over the lead on security assistance"" for his country. He also said Hegseth's attendance ""means that the US is continuing its security assistance and is beside us"". Healey, Pistorius and Umerov all accused Russia of dragging its feet over a ceasefire. Healey said it had been more than a month since Russia rejected a US-backed peace settlement. Pistorius said Russia was still not interested in peace. Talks in Europe took place as US special envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia, once more, to press the Kremlin to accept a truce. Witkoff met Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Friday as Donald Trump urged the Russian president to ""get moving"" on a ceasefire in Ukraine. Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin and Witkoff would discuss the Ukraine war, but one should not expect any ""breakthroughs"". On the ground in Ukraine, Russia's defence ministry said on Thursday that its forces had captured the village of Zhuravka, in Ukraine's northern border region of Sumy. Ukrainian officials are yet to confirm this. Earlier this week, President Zelensky said as many as 67,000 Russian soldiers were positioned north of the border of the Sumy region, in preparation for an attack on the city of Sumy.",Ukraine allies pledge €21bn in fresh military aid,"Jonathan Beale, Malu Cursino",BBC News,2025-04-11T09:24:19,2025-04-11T13:22:53,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2025/04/11/the-clock-is-ticking-for-iran-00287080,"President DONALD TRUMP set a 60-day deadline for Iran to make progress on talks over its nuclear program or face potential military retaliation, according to four people familiar with the matter. The deadline, set out in Trump’s letter to Iran’s leader, sets the stakes for a high-profile meeting between the president’s top Middle East envoy, STEVE WITKOFF, and Iran’s foreign minister, ABBAS ARAGHCHI, in Oman on Saturday. It’ll be the first significant talks between Washington and its arch Middle Eastern rival since Trump took office. But some Israeli officials and GOP Iran hawks in Congress privately fear that these negotiations could play into Tehran’s favor, though few will openly criticize the president’s diplomatic efforts. That’s according to one current and one former Israeli official, as well as two GOP congressional aides and a former senior U.S. official familiar with the matter. We granted some of them anonymity as they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about sensitive diplomatic negotiations. They fear both Iran using the talks as a delaying tactic to rebuild its forces — or the prospect of Trump agreeing to a bad deal for the sake of clinching a quick diplomatic win. At the moment, Iran is reeling from Israel’s onslaught against its main proxy militant groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, and direct Israeli attacks on Iran’s military facilities late last year. From Iran’s perspective, “this is about intentionally wasting time it will use to advance its nuclear program and get in better standing with the international community,” said JONATHAN PANIKOFF, a former career senior U.S. intelligence officer who is now a Middle East security analyst at the Atlantic Council. “If this negotiation goes on and on, … what will we do? We have a window of opportunity that Iran is weak,” said JACOB NAGEL, a former head of Israel’s National Security Council now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. Nagel said he feared Trump would agree to a quick deal, even if it’s bad, for the optics. “Another check mark in his Nobel prize list and he will go to the next problem in the world,” Nagel said. Iran is reportedly open to an interim agreement on its nuclear program before pursuing talks on a more comprehensive agreement, as Axios reports today. Witkoff, in a newly published interview with The Wall Street Journal, signaled he was going into the talks open to allowing Iran to continue its nuclear program — so long as Tehran doesn’t weaponize it. “Where our red line will be, there can’t be weaponization of your nuclear capability,” he said. DAN SHAPIRO, a former senior Pentagon official and ambassador to Israel, said Iran could retaliate if the U.S. or Israel takes military action. “They have cards, and they’re playing them to try to steer the negotiations toward an outcome that they can live with,” said Shapiro. A spokesperson for Witkoff declined to comment. The National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment. Still, the 60-day deadline (which Trump outlined in his letter sent last month to Iran, according to four people familiar with the matter) could pressure Iran to move on a good deal. We also wanted to know, amid all this anxiety, what a good deal could possibly look like, particularly from Israel’s perspective. AMOS YADLIN, a former head of Israeli intelligence, told us: “It must include no sunset clauses, deal with the military dimension of the program, include much better inspections, include Iran entering into a 123 agreement and limit Iranian ballistic missiles — this is the minimum I think that will be considered as a deal that Israel could accept.” The Inbox WITKOFF’S OTHER MISSION: Before Witkoff heads to Oman for talks with Iran, he stopped in Moscow today and met with Russian leader VLADIMIR PUTIN. The meeting was the third between Trump’s envoy and Putin at the Kremlin as Washington pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump appears to be losing patience with Moscow, posting on Truth Social that “Russia has to get moving. Too many people are DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war.” LIBYA’S MAGA CHARM OFFENSIVE: ABDELKARIM MGEG, a Libyan nuclear scientist-turned-politician, this week courted top Republican politicians during a visit to Washington as he tries to become the United Nations-backed pick to be the next prime minister of the conflict-racked North African country, our Daniel Lippman writes in. In the last few days, he met with staffers of Senate Foreign Relations Chair JIM RISCH (R-Idaho) and Sens. JONI ERNST (R-Iowa) and KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-N.Y.), he said in a brief interview. And at the National Republican Congressional Committee president’s dinner Tuesday at the National Building Museum, he chatted with Speaker MIKE JOHNSON and former House Foreign Affairs Chair MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-Texas). Mgeg tailored his conversations to the MAGA vibes of Washington, making pitches on how the United States could help “make Libya great” and Libya could work together on getting more private investment into the country, as well as cooperate on security, energy and immigration. It’s an atypical strategy for getting Washington’s blessing. But Mgeg’s efforts come as Libya struggles to maintain political stability. The country is presently split in two, with separate governments in the west and east dueling for control of the whole country, with both sides courting more foreign engagement for international legitimacy. NEW ENEMIES OF MY ENEMY? China is increasing its outreach to countries hit hardest by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, in a sign that China may try to exploit the White House’s trade diatribes and peel away U.S. allies and partners. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson LIN JIAN also said that Chinese leader XI JINPING is going to Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia soon, on a conveniently timed trip that could help Beijing shore up its ties with some of Washington’s growing partners in the region. The U.S. has worked to deepen ties with Vietnam in recent years, and Malaysia and the U.S. have historically enjoyed a close diplomatic and security relationship. And China’s not just looking at its own neighborhood. Spanish Prime Minister PEDRO SÁNCHEZ was in Beijing today and met with Xi. That visit comes as China floats the idea of deeper European and Chinese trade partnerships to respond to Trump’s tariffs, as our colleague Aitor Hernández-Morales reports. That’s not the only trolling they’re doing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson MAO NING posted an image on X of a “Make America Great Again” hat with a “Made in China” sticker attached to it — and a pricetag increase of $50 to $77, a not-so-subtle reminder to the president that tariffs may increase prices on all goods manufactured in China. DRINKS WITH NATSEC DAILY: At the end of every long, hard week, we like to highlight how a prominent member of the national security scene prefers to unwind with a drink. Today, we’re featuring our new colleague Felicia Schwartz, who joined POLITICO this week from the Financial Times as our diplomatic correspondent and graciously stepped in to co-host today’s edition of your favorite newsletter. We had to ask how Felicia imbibes so that we could buy her a round of drinks for her troubles today. Felicia told us that her go-to drink is a Casamigos soda with a splash of lime juice, though she admits she’ll settle “for any blanco tequila whether I am roaming the embassies of D.C. or on the road following senior U.S. officials.” And it’s a tried and true drink for her, stretching from her adventures covering the U.N. General Assembly every year and her time based in Tel Aviv as a foreign correspondent. “I’ve found that simple, sugar-free cocktails are the secret to news gathering, or enjoyment, in the evenings, and then going back to work the next day without feeling completely dreadful,” Felicia says. Good advice for us all. Cheers, Felicia! IT’S FRIDAY! WELCOME TO THE WEEKEND: Thanks for tuning in to NatSec Daily!

His public debut is stirring more worries, based on keeping religion out of official day-to-day government work. In remarks this week to newly minted diplomats, Olowski referred numerous times to religion and God, according to a transcript obtained by our own Nahal Toosi. “To an officer of the United States like you and me, the Constitution is our commandment,” he said. “Its words are like the word of God and the words of the oath are our creation as officers. And these words are our beginning. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Olowski was clear, early in the remarks, that America protected the freedoms of nonbelievers as well as people of faith, saying the country’s commitment to religious liberty is “total.” But the text of his remarks has been circulating among diplomats, several of whom said they were uncomfortable with what they felt were overly religious overtones. NatSec Daily shared the transcript with spokespersons for the State Department as well as Olowski himself and asked for comment, but they did not reply. That’s not the only more explicit nod toward Christianity in Foggy Bottom. The State Department is telling staffers to report instances of “anti-Christian bias” within the workforce, part of an effort to implement a Trump administration executive order, according to a copy of a cable obtained by Robbie and Nahal. ANOTHER U.S. BROADCASTER BUCKLES: Middle East Broadcasting Networks Inc. will impose mass layoffs next week unless the Trump administration restores funding to the government-funded broadcaster. MBN was seen as a crucial tool to push back against propaganda in the Middle East put forward by U.S. adversaries like Iran and Russia. Those terminations follow ELON MUSK’s Department of Government Efficiency imposing a 30-day freeze on funding to MBN and other outlets supported by the Agency for Global Media, including Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe Liberty last month. The MBN terminations are a tactical move to allow the broadcaster time for legal challenges, MBN’s President JEFFREY GEDMIN told NatSec Daily. Keystrokes GROK GETS PROBED: Ireland is investigating whether Musk’s AI platform Grok was built using personal data from the X accounts of European citizens, our colleague Ellen O’Regan reports. In a statement, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission said it’d be investigating whether personal data “in publicly-accessible posts” on X was processed to train Grok, which could potentially violate the European Union’s data and transparency laws. The move, however, could stoke further tensions between Brussels and Washington, given Musk’s close relationship with Trump. The Complex GET YOUR ABACUS OUT: Defense budget watchers are scratching their heads at how the Trump administration will get towards its stated goal of a trillion dollar defense budget, our friends at Morning Defense reported this morning (for Pros!). Part of the confusion, per TODD HARRISON, an expert on defense budgeting who works at the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington, is that the administration has not specified whether Trump meant DOD (budget function 051) or broader national defense (050), which includes Energy Department nuclear programs. ICED OUT: The U.S. military just wished “farvel” to its top military in Greenland, our colleague Elena Giordano reports. Col. SUSANNAH MEYERS, commander of the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, was removed from her post after voicing dissent with Vice President JD VANCE’s visit to the Danish territory and support for U.S. annexation of the Arctic region. “I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the U.S. administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base,” Meyers wrote in an email to the base. Pentagon spokesperson SEAN PARNELL said Meyers was removed as “actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump’s agenda will not be tolerated.” Transitions — The Senate confirmed retired Lt.

https://apnews.com/article/explosion-hellenic-train-company-athens-882b4fc2d212577aa7ab5d3b1c66c1b9,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — A bomb planted near the offices of Hellenic Train, Greece’s main railway company, exploded Friday night in a busy district of central Athens, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries. The explosion comes amid widespread public anger over a 2023 railway disaster, Greece’s worst, in which 57 people were killed and dozens more injured when a freight train and a passenger train heading in opposite directions were accidentally put on the same track. Local media said a newspaper and a news website had received an anonymous call shortly before Friday’s blast, with the caller warning that a bomb had been planted outside the railway company offices and would explode within about 40 minutes. In a statement, Hellenic Train said the explosion had occurred “very close to its central offices” and said the blast had caused limited damage and no injuries to any employees or passers-by. It said authorities had acted immediately upon receiving information about the warning call, and that the company was cooperating fully with authorities and ensuring the safety of its staff. Police cordoned off the site along a major avenue in the Greek capital, keeping residents and tourists away from the building in an area with several bars and restaurants. Officers at the scene said a bag containing an explosive device had been placed near the Hellenic Train building on Syngrou Avenue. Police forensics experts wearing white coveralls were collecting evidence at the scene. Criticism over the government’s handling of the Feb. 28, 2023 collision at Tempe in northern Greece has mounted over the last few weeks in the wake of the second anniversary of the disaster, which killed mostly young people who had been returning to university classes after a public holiday. The crash exposed severe deficiencies in Greece’s railway system, including in safety systems, and has triggered mass protests - led by relatives of the victims - against the country’s conservative government. Critics accused authorities of failing to take political responsibility for the disaster or holding senior officials accountable. So far, only rail officials have been charged with any crimes. Several protests in recent weeks have turned violent, with demonstrators clashing with police. Earlier Friday, a heated debate in Parliament on the rail crash led to lawmakers voting to refer a former Cabinet minister to judicial authorities to be investigated over alleged violation of duty over his handling of the immediate aftermath of the accident. Hellenic Train said it “unreservedly condemns every form of violence and tension which are triggering a climate of toxicity that is undermining all progress.” Greece has a long history of politically-motivated violence dating back to the 1970s, with domestic extremist groups carrying out small-scale bombings which usually cause damage but rarely lead to injuries. While the groups most active in the 1980s and 1990s have been dismantled, new small groups have emerged. Last year, a man believed to have been trying to assemble a bomb was killed when the explosive device he was making exploded in a central Athens apartment. A woman inside the apartment was severely injured. The blast had prompted Minister of Citizen Protection Michalis Chrisochoidis to warn of an emerging new generation of domestic extremists.",A bomb strikes near the Athens offices of the Greek railway company.

https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-new-mexico-kansas-vaccine-e904ec9781f1d164c73afe4ab71774fe,"With one-fifth of states seeing active measles outbreaks, the U.S. is nearing 900 cases, according to figures posted Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s confirmed measles cases count is 884, triple the amount seen in all of 2024. The now three-month-long outbreak in Texas accounts for the vast majority of cases, with 663 confirmed as of Tuesday. The outbreak has also spread to New Mexico and Oklahoma. Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children died from measles-related illnesses in the epicenter in West Texas, and an adult in New Mexico who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness. Other states with active outbreaks — defined as three or more cases — include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. North America has two other ongoing outbreaks. One in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 1,020 cases from mid-October through Wednesday. And as of Tuesday, the Mexican state of Chihuahua state had 761 measles cases and one death, according to data from the state health ministry. The World Health Organization has said cases in Mexico are linked to the Texas outbreak. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000. As the virus takes hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates, health experts fear the virus that the spread could stretch on for a year. Here’s what else you need to know about measles in the U.S. How many measles cases are there in Texas and New Mexico? Texas state health officials said Tuesday there were 17 new cases of measles since Friday, bringing the total to 663 across 26 counties — most of them in West Texas. The state also added 23 hospitalizations to its count Tuesday saying they were from earlier in the outbreak, for a total of 87 hospitalizations.  State health officials estimated about 1% of cases — fewer than 10 — are actively infectious. Sixty percent of Texas’ cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 396 cases since late January — just over 1.5% of the county’s residents. The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Health officials in Texas said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February — Kennedy said age 6.  New Mexico announced one new case Friday, bringing the state’s total to 66. Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state’s cases are in Lea County. Three are in Eddy County and Chaves and Doña Ana counties have one each. State health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. New Mexico reported a measles-related death in an adult on March 6. How many cases are there in Indiana? Indiana confirmed two more cases April 21 in an outbreak that has sickened eight in Allen County in the northeast part of the state — five are unvaccinated minors and three are adults whose vaccination status is unknown. The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health said last week.  How many cases are there in Kansas? Kansas was steady last week with 37 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state. Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray and Morton counties have fewer than five cases each. Haskell County has the most with eight cases, Stevens County has seven, Kiowa County has six. The state’s first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas outbreak based on genetic testing.  How many cases are there in Michigan? Montcalm County, near Grand Rapids in western Michigan, has four linked measles cases. State health officials say the cases are tied to Canada’s large outbreak in Ontario. The state has nine confirmed measles cases as of Friday, but the remaining four are not part of the Montcalm County outbreak. How many cases are there in Montana? Montana state health officials announced five cases April 17 in unvaccinated children and adults who had traveled out of state, and confirmed it was an outbreak on Monday. All five are isolating at home in Gallatin County in the southwest part of the state. They are Montana’s first measles cases in 35 years. Health officials didn’t say whether the cases are linked to other outbreaks in North America. How many cases are there in Ohio? The Ohio Department of Health confirmed 32 measles cases in the state Thursday, and one hospitalization. The state count includes only Ohio residents. There are 16 cases in Ashtabula County near Cleveland, 14 in Knox County and one each in Allen and Holmes counties. Health officials in Knox County, in east-central Ohio, said there are a total of 20 people with measles, but seven of them do not live in the state.  How many cases are there in Oklahoma? Oklahoma added two cases Tuesday: 12 confirmed and three probable. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said. The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases, but Cleveland, Custer, Oklahoma and Sequoyah counties have had public exposures in the past couple of months. How many cases are there in Pennsylvania? There are eight measles cases in Erie County in far northwest Pennsylvania, officials said Friday. The county declared an outbreak in mid-April. The state said Friday it has 13 cases overall in 2025, including international travel-related cases in Montgomery County and one in Philadelphia.  How many cases are there in Tennessee? Tennessee has six measles cases as of Thursday. Health department spokesman Bill Christian said all cases are the middle part of the state, and that “at least three of these cases are linked to each other” but declined to specify further. The state also did not say whether the cases were linked to other outbreaks or when Tennessee’s outbreak started.  The state health department announced the state’s first measles case March 21, three more on April 1 and the last two on April 17, but none of the news releases declared an outbreak. Tennessee is on a list of outbreak states in a Thursday CDC report.  Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.? There have been 884 cases in 2025 as of Friday, according to the CDC. Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.  Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.  What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine? The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.  People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because most children back then had measles and now have “presumptive immunity.” In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”  But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. What are the symptoms of measles? Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash. The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. How can you treat measles? There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable. ___ AP Science Writer Laura Ungar contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The plan suggests a second successive EU-China summit would be held in the Chinese capital, despite the fact that the location is supposed to rotate.

No date has been confirmed with the Chinese side, but EU leaders’ willingness to make the trip indicates a serious effort to re-engage with Beijing at a time when the bloc’s relationship with the United States has effectively collapsed.

The crash was reported at 3:17 p.m. on the Jersey City side of the Hudson. Agustin Escobar, a Siemens executive from Barcelona, Spain, his wife Merce Camprubi Montal, and their children, ages 4, 5, and 11, were killed in the crash, law enforcement sources told ABC News. The pilot, who was 36, was also killed, making a total six people. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the helicopter was operated by New York Helicopters. The FAA believes the helicopter is a Bell 206 and appears to have taken off from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport at 2:59 p.m. It went up to the George Washington Bridge before turning back south along the Jersey side of the river. It went off radar at 3:25 p.m. Video shared with Eyewitness News appeared to show pieces of the helicopter break apart and crash into the water. Officials say the helicopter hit the water inverted, without a tail rotor or a main rotor blade. For witnesses, it turned out to be a memory full of horror. ""I watched it fall out of the sky! I heard five or six loud noises that sounded almost like gunshots in the sky and saw pieces fall off, then watched it fall into the river,"" said Dani Horbiak, who saw the crash from her apartment window. ""It sounded like a sonic boom on my right and so I look up and literally I see a helicopter splitting in two with the rotor flying off and this guy was going straight into the water and nothing came up afterwards,"" said a witness named Max. Officials say the entire flight lasted all of 15 minutes, before witnesses say it took an upside-down nosedive. ""It just kind of fell apart and it was the most terrifying thing that we ever witnessed,"" Rajany said. ""I heard some crackling, looked up and then just saw a plane falling apart,"" said witness Bruce Wall. ""And then maybe 15 feet in the air after the tail came off, broke off, and then the plane just sort of tumbled into the water with the propeller still in the air."" FDNY and NYPD divers were in the water almost immediately and assisted in the recovery. Four of the victims were declared dead at the scene and two victims were sent to local hospitals where they were pronounced dead. Jersey City Medical Center, where the passengers were transported after the crash, tried as hard as they could, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said. ""Our hearts go out to the family and those on board,"" Mayor Eric Adams said. A crane vessel hoisted the crumpled wreckage of the helicopter out of the Hudson and onto a barge Thursday night. Fulop said the main body of the aircraft has been recovered and is in the Army Corps of Engineers facility on Chapel Avenue, however major parts of the aircraft have still not been recovered. He says dive operations by the NYPD and NJSP will resume Friday morning. Police fished out chunks of jagged metal that washed up to the Jersey City shore, along with a life preserver, a seat and the personal effects of a family of five. The Spanish Consulate of New York City is now in touch with authorities to gather and confirm information and identification of the people involved in the helicopter crash, according to the communications team at the Spanish Foreign Ministry. The Jersey City Police Department is taking the lead on the investigation since the helicopter crashed on the Jersey City side of the river, Fulop said. Fulop said tours in the area are constant and fall within a busy and heavily trafficked area. He hopes this will increase the dialogue to decrease traffic. ""Hopefully this brings some more attention to it, that the fact beyond just noise, you have real safety concerns,"" Fulop said. The FAA says they are temporarily halting all operations around the Hudson River crash site. The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate the crash, and is expected to arrive on Thursday night. They will have to piece together what went wrong, and what caused the rotors to break apart, dooming the 21-year-old helicopter and the six people aboard. At least 32 people have died in helicopter crashes in NYC since 1977 -- most recently in 2019 when a helicopter used for executive travel hit the roof of Manhattan skyscraper in restricted airspace and the pilot was killed. ---------- * Get Eyewitness News Delivered * Follow us on YouTube * More local news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250410010100315,"SEOUL, April 11 (Yonhap) -- South Korea established diplomatic relations with Syria this week, the foreign ministry said Friday, a diplomatic milestone that completed Seoul's endeavors to have formal ties with every U.N. member state except North Korea. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul traveled to Damascus on Thursday (local time) to finalize the procedure and met with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani for talks on the development of bilateral relations, it said. Syria was the last U.N. member state with which South Korea did not have diplomatic ties. With the opening of the new ties, South Korea now has official relations with all 191 U.N. member states except North Korea. Additionally, South Korea has diplomatic ties with three non-U.N. members: the South Pacific island nations of the Cook Islands and Niue, and the Holy See. ""This development opens a new chapter of cooperation with Syria, whose bilateral relations with South Korea had been severed due to its close ties with North Korea,"" the ministry said in a release.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) During talks with Al-Shaibani, Cho expressed hope that bilateral cooperation will contribute to Syria's development and regional stability as South Korea is ready to share its experience in economic growth to back Syria's reconstruction process, the ministry said. Cho also discussed with his counterpart the possibility of South Korean companies participating in reconstruction efforts, as well as providing humanitarian assistance to the Arab nation, including medicine, medical equipment and rice. The Syrian minister expressed his gratitude for South Korea's offers while hoping that Seoul will support its bid to have sanctions on his country eased, the ministry said. Following the talks, Cho paid a courtesy call on Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. During the meeting, Cho noted that Syria's efforts to meet international expectations, such as undertaking an inclusive political process, taking a firm stance against extremism and eliminating chemical weapons, will help create an environment conducive to its reconstruction and sustainable economic development. The minister said that South Korea was willing to play a role in supporting the new Syrian government's efforts. In response, Al-Sharra hailed the formation of ties with South Korea, highlighting that South Korea's support is ""crucial for a new Syria embarking on a fresh start,"" and hoping for a ""friendly and cooperative relationship that contributes to international peace,"" according to Seoul's ministry.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) Since the launch of Syria's interim government in December, led by former rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, South Korea had been stepping up efforts to establish formal diplomatic ties with the Arab nation. A foreign ministry official paid a visit to Syria in early February and confirmed the interim government's willingness to pursue bilateral relations. The move to open diplomatic relations was approved at a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on March 18. The establishment of formal ties with Syria is expected to further expand South Korea's diplomatic reach, following its surprise announcement in New York in February last year to forge relations with Cuba. Seoul's ties with Havana dealt a blow to Pyongyang, Cuba's Cold War-era ally, which has long touted its ""brotherly"" relationship with the socialist Caribbean state. Syria has maintained ties with North Korea since establishing diplomatic relations in 1966. In December, Syria's rebel fighters overthrew the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, bringing an end to half a century of dictatorship by the Assad family. Al-Sharaa has since been named president for the transitional period. elly@yna.co.kr(END)",S.

The court's ruling immediately reinstated Park nearly four months after he was impeached by the National Assembly on charges of aiding and abetting Yoon before and after his surprise declaration of martial law on Dec. 3. ""There is no evidence or objective material to back allegations that he aided the president's declaration of martial law by implied or tacit agreement,"" the court said in delivering its unanimous verdict. Park was accused of not opposing the former president during a Cabinet meeting held immediately before his martial law announcement. He was also alleged to have planned the government's response at a presidential safe house following parliament's reversal of the decree and prepared a detention facility for lawmakers while the order was in force. ""Simply because he held a meeting at the presidential safe house after the martial law was lifted, the defendant cannot be said to have been involved in an act of insurrection through discussions on legal follow-up measures for the act of insurrection or a consideration of response measures,"" the court said. Park had denied the charges, saying he actively sought to dissuade Yoon from declaring martial law and did not discuss follow-up measures during the gathering at the presidential safe house. hague@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) Constitutional Court rejects justice minister's impeachment over martial law involvement,Lee Haye-ah,Yonhap News Agency,2025-04-10T15:06:01,2025-04-10T15:06:01,gemini-2.0-flash

Kim made the remarks during a press conference in Tokyo, where he reaffirmed Seoul's commitment to achieving the complete denuclearization of North Korea, enhancing international cooperation and strengthening extended deterrence through the South Korea-U.S. alliance. ""The complete denuclearization of North Korea may seem like an unattainable goal, but a path forward will open if the international community joins hands,"" Kim said, noting that the Donald Trump administration also pursued the objective. Though China and Russia have not taken a firm stance on sanctions against Pyongyang, Kim pointed out that both countries share a desire for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula so they are unlikely to oppose reunification or efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Asked about his view on calls from some for South Korea's independent nuclear armament, Kim made it clear that the government is not considering the development of its own nuclear weapons and remains committed to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Kim is in Japan for a three-day visit through Friday, which aims at enhancing two-way cooperation on inter-Korean unification issues and the North Korea policy under Japan's Shigeru Ishiba administration. During his meeting with Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, Kim exchanged views on the security situation in North Korea and reaffirmed the importance of close cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo, as well as trilateral coordination involving the United States, according to Japan's Kyodo News. Kim also reiterated the South Korean government's support for the immediate resolution of the issue of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea, it added. Kim held separate talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, during which he called for maintaining close bilateral ties and building a future-oriented cooperative relationship to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula and around the world. Iwaya emphasized that relations between the two neighboring countries are crucial in today's strategic environment, according to the report. graceoh@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) Unification minister says united global response key to deterring N.K. provocations,Oh Seok-min,Yonhap News Agency,2025-04-10T21:52:21,2025-04-10T21:52:21,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250410003751315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, April 10 (Yonhap) -- Former President Yoon Suk Yeol is set to leave the presidential residence Friday to return to his private residence in southern Seoul, officials said Thursday, following his removal from office last week.

 Yoon plans to leave the official residence at 5 p.m. Friday move to his private residence, a senior presidential official said in a press notice.

 The Presidential Security Service (PSS) has reportedly completed organizing a private residence security team of about 40 people for Yoon. Under the current law, Yoon can receive protection from the PSS for up to 10 years.

 Yoon's private residence is located at the Acrovista apartment complex in Seocho-dong, southern Seoul, and he previously stayed there for six months even after his presidential inauguration in May 2022.

 Yoon and his wife, Kim Keon Hee, are reportedly considering moving to another private residence in the capital area later because they own as many as 11 pet dogs and cats and the presence of security guards may cause some inconveniences for neighbors.

https://apnews.com/article/sudan-war-uae-icj-genocide-convention-rsf-857a66e660bf9ea8417e8e32c097e7c8,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The United Arab Emirates argued at the UN’s top court on Thursday that it has no jurisdiction to rule on a claim of genocide lodged by Sudan. The UAE told the judges at the International Court of Justice that the allegations the country is breaching the genocide convention by arming and funding the rebel paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces were a misuse of the institution. Sudan wants The Hague-based court to issue emergency orders, known as provisional measures, including telling the UAE to do all it can to prevent the killing and other crimes targeting the Masalit people. “The idea that the UAE is somehow the driver of this reprehensible conflict in Sudan could not be further from the truth,” said Reem Ketait, a senior official at the UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She described the case as “the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE.” Both Sudan and the UAE are signatories to the 1948 genocide convention. The United Arab Emirates, however, has a caveat to part of the treaty which legal experts say makes it unlikely that the case will proceed. “The ICJ has previously said that this kind of reservation is allowed and is a barrier to a case going forward. The court is most likely to say the same thing in this case, meaning that this case will not go forward,” Melanie O’Brien, an associate professor of international law at the University of Western Australia and an expert on the convention, told The Associated Press. Sudan descended into a deadly conflict in mid-April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary rebels broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions. Both the Rapid Support Forces and Sudan’s military have been accused of abuses. The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and a U.S. ally, has been repeatedly accused of arming the RSF, something it has strenuously denied despite evidence to the contrary. Conflict Observatory, a monitoring group which is funded by the U.S. State Department, has identified aircraft it says carried UAE arms transfers to the RSF. Those flights went through Maréchal Idriss Deby international airport in Amdjarass, Chad. The UAE says the purpose of the flights was to support a local hospital. In January, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, also known as Hemedti, had been targeted for sanctions along with seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates. That came as the U.S. declared the RSF rebels are committing genocide. The war has killed more than 24,000 people and driven over 14 million people — about 30% of the population — from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries. The Sudanese Armed Forces have broadly retaken Khartoum from the RSF. Last month, the military said it had recaptured Khartoum’s international airport.",UAE rejects Sudan's claim at UN court that it is breaching genocide convention by funding rebels,Molly Quell,AP News,2025-04-10T06:26:41,2025-04-10T08:26:47,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-force-coalition-britain-france-nato-4c87525361eb3cf1c860075d4519f6d8,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Britain’s defense minister on Thursday urged his counterparts from around 30 countries to press ahead with plans to deploy troops to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia, as questions remained over whether the United States would provide backup. Chairing the first meeting of the so-called coalition of the willing at the level of defense ministers, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said its members must ensure “that we’re fully prepared for the moment a peace agreement is reached.” “We must be ready for when that peace comes. That’s why the work of this coalition is so vital,” Healey said at NATO headquarters in Brussels. He added that 200 military planners have been developing plans to deepen European involvement in Ukraine. In a post on social media, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that “Ukraine is ready for peace — one that is just and backed by strength.” Ukrainian government officials and military analysts have said that Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in Ukraine in the coming weeks to maximize pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin’s negotiating position in ceasefire talks. As usual with coalition gatherings, the United States did not take part. The success of the coalition’s operation hinges on U.S. backup with airpower or other military assistance, but the Trump administration has made no public commitment to provide support. The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland underlined the “crucial” role of the United States. “The United States is a crucial player still in guaranteeing lasting security” in Ukraine, said Finnish Defense Minister Annit Häkkänen. His Swedish counterpart, Pål Jonson, said success in Ukraine requires “some form of U.S. engagement” while Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans called American support “very important” but said the form it took might differ, depending on the chosen type of European mission in Ukraine. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said ministers were “trying to keep the United States on board.” Amid that uncertainty and U.S. warnings that Europe must take care of its own security and that of Ukraine in future, the force is seen as a first test of the continent’s willingness to defend itself and its interests. Its make-up will depend on the nature of any peace agreement, but the contingent is unlikely to be stationed at Ukraine’s border with Russia. It would be located farther from the ceasefire line, perhaps even outside Ukraine, and deploy to counter any Russian attack. Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent is proving a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops. Healey said the “reassurance force for Ukraine would be a committed and credible security arrangement to ensure that any negotiated peace does bring what President Trump has pledged: a lasting peace for Ukraine.” But some countries are reluctant to contribute personnel without U.S. support. The Europeans cannot match U.S. weapons systems, intelligence gathering and satellite surveillance capabilities. More fundamentally, members of the coalition are still trying to establish how the force would operate: Leading countries want a robust deterrence force to defend against any Russian attack. Brekelmans said key questions must be answered like “what is the potential mission? What is going to be the goal? What is the mandate? What would we do in different scenarios, for example, if there would be any escalation regarding Russia?” Some countries — Italy and the Netherlands, for example — require the approval of their national parliaments before they can deploy troops. On Friday, representatives from around 50 nations will gather at NATO to drum up military support for Ukraine. That meeting will be chaired by Britain and Germany. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to join the meeting via video from Washington. — AP writer Sam McNeil contributed to this report from Barcelona, Spain.",Ukraine 'coalition of the willing' presses ahead with force planning amid doubts about US support,"Lorne Cook, SAM McNEIL",AP News,2025-04-10T06:31:31,2025-04-10T00:22:21,gemini-2.0-flash

The talks follow a letter sent by US President Donald Trump on March 7, urging Khamenei to resume nuclear negotiations and warning of possible military action if Iran refuses. Tehran responded weeks later, saying it was open to indirect negotiations and dismissed the possibility of direct talks as long as the United States maintains its “maximum pressure” policy. “The leader said that we are ready to negotiate, but not in direct negotiations because we do not trust them,” Pezeshkian said. Iran has long viewed Washington as being behind attempts to interfere in and destabilize its government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution which toppled the US-backed Pahlavi dynasty. Ties have remained frozen ever since, with any contacts made via the Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents American interests in the country, or through intermediaries such as Oman. In December 2024, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said attempts at regime change in Iran “have not exactly been resounding successes.” Since returning to the White House for a second term in January, Trump has reinstated his “maximum pressure” sanctions policy against Iran. During his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sweeping economic sanctions. Tehran adhered to the 2015 deal for a year after Washington withdrew from it, but later began rolling back its own commitments. After signing the accord in 2015, Khamenei said the United States had sought “to use these negotiations and this agreement to find a way to infiltrate the country.” “We have closed this path and we will close it decisively,” he said. “We will not allow American economic infiltration into our country, nor their political infiltration, nor their political presence, nor their cultural infiltration.” Read more: Iran FM warns Trump against ‘military option’ ahead of nuclear talks Iran skeptical over coming US talks, Iranian officials say Iran says deal can be reached if US shows goodwill","Iran open to US investment but rejects regime change attempts, says Pezeshkian",AFP,Al Arabiya English,2025-04-09T06:59:00,2025-04-09T06:59:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.timesofisrael.com/macron-says-france-could-recognize-a-palestinian-state-in-june/,"France plans to recognize a Palestinian state within months and could make the move at a UN conference in New York in June on settling the Israel-Palestinian conflict, French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday. “We must take the path of recognition [of the Palestinian state]. So that’s what we’re gonna do in the coming months,” Macron, who just returned from a trip to Egypt during which he visited the Gaza border, told France 5 television. Israel’s foreign minister denounced the idea as being a “reward for terrorism.” Macron indicated that the move could come at a June United Nations conference co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia on creating a Palestinian state. “Our aim is to chair this conference with Saudi Arabia in June, where we could finalize this movement of mutual recognition [of a Palestinian state] by several parties,” he added. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories “I won’t do it for unity or in order to please someone,” Macron continued. “I’ll do it because I think that at some point it would be fair. And also because I want to take part in a collective dynamic, one that allows everyone who defends Palestine to also recognize Israel.” Such recognition would allow France “to be clear in our fight against those who deny Israel’s right to exist — which is the case with Iran — and to commit ourselves to collective security in the region,” he added. He argued the move will serve regional security, a claim rejected by Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, who said it will have the opposite effect. “‘Unilateral recognition’ of an imaginary Palestinian state by any state in the reality familiar to us all will be nothing but a reward for terrorism and a strengthening of Hamas,” Sa’ar wrote on X. “Things like this will not only not bring peace, security, and stability closer to our region — but on the contrary: They will push them further away.” Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar speaks at the Israeli embassy in France after his meeting with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, April 3, 2025, in Paris. (AP Garriga) France’s recognition of Palestinian statehood “would be a step in the right direction in line with safeguarding the rights of the Palestinian people and the two-state solution,” Palestinian Authority Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Varsen Aghabekian Shahin told AFP. In Egypt this week, Macron held summit talks with President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II. He also took part in a joint phone call alongside the leaders with	US President Donald Trump, urging an end to the war in Gaza. France has long championed a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, including after the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023. But formal recognition by Paris of a Palestinian state would mark a major policy switch and risk antagonizing Israel, which insists such moves by foreign states are premature. Israel has argued that unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state now will be viewed as a reward for Hamas’s October 7 onslaught. Israel’s military campaign to rid the Gaza Strip of Hamas has sparked worldwide sympathy for Palestinians and galvanized support for recognizing statehood in some capitals. Last year Spain, Norway, Ireland and Slovenia all recognized a Palestinian state, provoking fury from Israel.

https://apnews.com/article/african-union-israel-ambassador-evicted-rwanda-genocide-f22033810dc019bd632deed7bb9fab25,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — Israel ’s ambassador to Ethiopia was ejected from an African Union event this week and has described it as outrageous. An Israeli official on Wednesday told The Associated Press the ejection from the annual event commemorating the 1994 Rwanda genocide was at the request of AU Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Youssouf. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to a journalist. “The new African Union Commission chairperson chose to introduce anti-Israel political elements,” the ambassador, Avraham Nigusse, asserted Tuesday on social media. It “reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the histories of both the Rwandan and Jewish peoples,” he added, saying he had been invited by Rwanda. The spokesperson for Youssouf, a former foreign minister of Djibouti, did not respond to requests for comment. Youssouf started his four-year AU term in February. A diplomat at the AU on Wednesday said Israel’s ambassador was removed because they no longer had observer status at the continental body based in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalists. Israel regained observer status at the AU in 2021, two decades after it was revoked over its conflict with the Palestinians, as Jerusalem sought wider ties with African nations. However, the observer status was suspended again in 2023 pending review by a committee of African heads of state. They have yet to deliver a verdict. In 2023, a senior Israeli diplomat was evicted from the AU’s annual summit for not having proper accreditation. The pan-African body has strong ties to the Palestinians, often inviting their leaders to address major gatherings. Israel last month shattered a ceasefire and renewed its military offensive in Gaza. The territory’s Health Ministry says more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war with Hamas started with the militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. South Africa, a prominent AU member, has brought a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide during its military operations in Gaza.

https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-panama-ports-hutchison-audit-393722d9e86ddc6554a4aab661cef3e6,"HONG KONG (AP) — A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate that is embroiled in U.S.-China tensions over its Panama Canal port assets denied allegations Wednesday that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country. Panama’s comptroller authority announced on Monday that an audit of Panama Ports Company found irregularities in the renewal of a 25-year port concession in the interoceanic canal. The authority’s accusations came the same day as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s arrival in the country to participate in a security conference. The Panama Ports Company, or PPC, defended itself in a statement Wednesday, saying it had made significant investments that exceeded $1.69 billion, surpassing the $50 million investment required under the original concession contract signed in 1997. That was also more than another $1 billion agreed to in an addendum. It said the investments were confirmed by the country’s comptroller general in 2020 after a thorough audit. The company said any statement about what it should have paid under the original concession contract must take into account the respective addenda, which was validly executed and approved by law. “To express the opposite, as it unfortunately has been the case, not only distorts the reality of the existing legal relationship between PPC and the State under the concession contract and its addenda, but also contradicts the State’s own acts over the years,” it said, referring to Panama. It said any claim that the company has failed to pay about $1.2 billion to Panama is false and that it believes “respect for legal certainty gives companies and investors the certainty that Panama is a safe country in which to invest.” Panama Ports Company, under Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings, won a concession to operate the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, beginning in 1997 and it was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. CK Hutchison is controlled by the family of Li Ka-shing, the southern Chinese city’s richest man. U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged Chinese interference with the critical shipping lane’s operations — accusations that Panamanian authorities have denied. Hegseth said Tuesday that the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation. Last month, CK Hutchison announced a tentative deal to sell its canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., which pleased Trump but angered Beijing. China’s Hong Kong affairs offices have posted scathing commentaries from a local state-backed media outlet over the tentative deal. Chinese anti-monopoly authorities said they would review the business agreement, a state-backed news outlet reported last month. It is unclear how the geopolitical pressure might affect the deal. But analysts have warned that a cancellation could cause the Trump administration to impose more sanctions or restrictions on businesses and individuals in Hong Kong and mainland China.",Hong Kong company denies that it failed to pay Panama under a contract to operate its canal ports,KANIS LEUNG,AP News,2025-04-09T15:55:08,2025-04-09T11:55:08,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/russian-minister-guilty-of-british-sanction-violations-b42f71d284ad2d92ce3b011c27ec0138,"LONDON (AP) — A former Russian government minister became the first person Wednesday to be convicted in the U.K. of circumventing sanctions put in place after the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, who was appointed governor of Sevastopol in Crimea by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2016, used a British bank account to illegally receive tens of thousands of pounds from his wife and accepted gifts and payments from his brother, prosecutors said. Ovsiannikov, who also served as deputy minister for industry and trade, was an important political figure placed under European Union sanctions in 2017 for work that threatened the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, prosecutors said. The sanctions were adopted in the U.K. in 2019 as it left the E.U. “He knew he had been on the U.K. sanctions list since 2017 but chose to ignore this,” said Julius Capon of the Crown Prosecution Service. “Another member of his family sought deliberately to breach the sanctions to live their own lavish lifestyle and showed complete disregard for the law.” Ovsiannikov, 48, was convicted in Southwark Crown Court of six out of seven counts of circumventing sanctions between February 2023 and January 2024. The jury couldn’t reach a verdict on the final count. He was also convicted of possessing and using criminal property. His brother, Alexei Owsjanikow, 47, was convicted Wednesday of two counts of circumventing sanctions for paying school tuition for Ovsiannikov’s children. He was found not guilty of three additional counts of breaching sanctions for buying his brother a Mercedes-Benz worth 54,500 pounds ($70,000) and giving him access to a bank account. Ekaterina Ovsiannikova, 47, was cleared of four counts of circumventing sanctions for allegedly funneling 76,000 pounds ($97,000) to her husband. Lawyers had argued the brother and wife didn’t know Ovsiannikov faced sanctions or were unaware he couldn’t receive financial assistance. All three are Russian nationals, though Ovsiannikov and his brother have British passports because their father was born in England. The CPS said the case was the first prosecution for breaching sanctions put in place by the U.K. in 2019. “Mr. Ovsiannikov thought he could hide from our sanctions,” Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said in a statement. “We are resolutely committed to increasing pressure on Putin, his cronies, and all those who aid his barbaric war in Ukraine.” Ovsiannikov and his brother will be sentenced at a later date.",Former Russian minister convicted in UK for violating British sanctions,Brian Melley,AP News,2025-04-09T19:33:53,2025-04-09T15:33:53,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/thailand-monarchy-us-scholar-defamation-military-c8943d59d9158737860a54aab0e1f3f1,"BANGKOK (AP) — A U.S scholar teaching in Thailand who was jailed on charges of insulting the country’s monarchy — an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison — was released on bail on Wednesday, but also had his visa revoked, an indication he could be deported soon. An appeals court granted Paul Chambers’ release on bail after it was twice denied on Tuesday by a lower court, said the advocacy group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. No trial date has been set. However, since immigration police earlier on Wednesday revoked his visa, Chambers could be deported home to the United States at any time. He has the right to appeal the visa revocation within 48 hours, according to police Maj. Gen. Sarawut Khonyai. Chambers was first jailed on Tuesday pending trial following a complaint by the Thai army that he had insulted the nation’s monarchy, an offense also known as “112” after its article number in the criminal code. He has been working as a lecturer at Naresuan University in Thailand’s northern province of Phitsanulok, The U.S. State Department said in a statement Tuesday that it was alarmed by Chamber’s arrest and urged “Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.” A 58-year-old Oklahoma native with a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, Chambers has studied the Thai military, which has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago. The charge against him was related to a webinar he took part in last October, organized by the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore. His defenders say he had nothing to do with what was quoted in the charge sheet. He was also charged with violating the Computer Crime Act, covering online activities. Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate of the Thai lawyers’ group said Chambers’ visa was revoked on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking. Thai law calls for 3-15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere. The legislation has also been used to punish critics of the government and the military. Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people — many of them student activists — have been charged with violating the law.",A US scholar jailed in Thailand on charges of insulting the monarchy is released on bail,Grant Peck,AP News,2025-04-09T20:52:39,2025-04-09T16:52:39,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/shipping-emissions-climate-change-25de476e26d3a2abd642bdfd49430d1f,"Nations are trying to reach an agreement to charge commercial vessels a fee for their emissions in what would effectively be the world’s first global carbon tax. The International Maritime Organization, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely. Its Marine Environment Protection Committee meets Monday through Friday in London. The committee, comprised of IMO member states, is working to approve proposed new global regulations to put a price on maritime greenhouse gas emissions and to set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The measures are more than climate aspirations – they will become mandatory for ships operating globally, said IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, who thinks the industry must do more to cut carbon pollution. The committee will “set the course for a net-zero future for the maritime sector,” he told The Associated Press in a statement Thursday. The future of clean shipping hangs in the balance, said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green. Fenton said a high price, simple flat-rate levy on shipping’s greenhouse gas emissions is the only way to decarbonize the industry equitably. “If an agreement is reached, it would represent a huge moment of solidarity in the fight to tackle climate change,” Fenton said. “For the first time, we will have, hopefully, an effective global framework tackling this international issue. Most emissions are tackled domestically.” Here’s what to know: Emissions from shipping have increased over the last decade — to about 3% of the global total according to the United Nations — as vessels have gotten much bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fuel oil. Maritime nations agreed in 2023 to slash emissions from the shipping industry, though several experts and nations were critical of the deal since it did not set 2050 as a hard date. The IMO is now in the process of adopting regulations to achieve the goals agreed to in 2023. A simple climate levy paired with a green fuel standard would help narrow the price gap between fossil fuels and green fuels, such as hydrogen, methanol and ammonia, according to the Global Maritime Forum, a nonprofit that works closely with the industry. Shipping relies heavily on fossil fuels and the sector won’t transition off those on its own, said Jesse Fahnestock, who leads the forum’s decarbonization work. And it will take time to build up a supply of e-fuels based on renewable electricity so investments need to happen now, he added. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil, releasing carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned. Dominguez has said that major decarbonizing requires an overhaul of shipping fuel. The Clean Shipping Coalition is calling on governments to commit to a high price on all ship emissions and a strong fuel standard. The alliance of environmental non-profits is also urging countries to revise the IMO’s tool for measuring a ship’s carbon intensity, to quantify and raise their efficiency transparently and drive down the amount of fuel burned long-term. Led by Pacific island nations, whose very existence is threatened by climate change, more than 60 countries support a flat levy per metric ton of emissions to reach net zero in a fair way. The shipping industry supports a fee, too. The International Chamber of Shipping represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet. Its secretary general, Guy Platten, said a pricing mechanism for maritime emissions is a pragmatic solution and the most effective way to incentivize a rapid energy transition in shipping. Some countries, notably China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, want a credit trading model instead of a fixed levy, where ships get credits for staying under their emissions target and ships purchase credits if they go over. Other countries want a compromise between the two models. Some fear that anything short of a universal levy would jeopardize climate goals and allow wealthier ship owners to buy compliance while continuing to pollute. Ambassador Albon Ishoda, Marshall Islands’ special envoy for maritime decarbonization, said IMO’s climate targets are “meaningless” without the levy. Revenue from a levy could be used to help developing countries transition to greener shipping, so they aren’t left behind with dirty fuels and old ships. If the committee agrees and finalizes text for the regulations, they could be formally adopted in October and take effect in 2027. That could send a powerful signal that the green transition is happening and that it’s possible for a global industry, according to the IMO. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

https://apnews.com/article/serbia-media-eu-monitoring-group-fe82dda84c8b06676b9d43ad69336ef3,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Press freedom in Serbia has reached a “critical” situation, with attacks and threats against journalists on the rise amid massive anti-government protests, an international media monitoring group said on Wednesday. “We came here because we observed an unprecedented crisis for media in Serbia,” Jasmijn de Zeeuw, from the Free Press Unlimited group, said. De Zeeuw, who was part of a Media Freedom Rapid Response, or MFRR, delegation visiting Serbia this week, urged a response from the European Union. Serbia is formally seeking EU membership, but populist President Aleksandar Vucic has faced accusations of stifling democratic freedoms, including the freedom of the press. De Zeeuw said attacks on journalists in Serbia have doubled compared to a year ago, while 56 incidents have occurred in response to the media coverage of a Nov. 1 train station tragedy in Serbia’s north that killed 16 people and the protests that followed. “The instances we recorded include physical attacks, threats, including severe death threats, online smear campaigns, raids of offices without search warrants and blockades of journalists and media.” de Zeeuw said. “We are strongly disturbed by the number of violations against press,” she added. Last week, Reporters Without Borders issued a similar verdict, saying: “Serbian journalism is being systematically repressed yet European political leaders remain locked in a state of guilty inaction.” The MFRR, which is co-funded by the EU, tracks, monitors and reacts to violations of press and media freedom in EU member states and candidate countries. There was no immediate reaction from the Serbian government to the findings. The government’s Information Ministry earlier this week expressed “concern” that the MFRR mission will not be objective and impartial and was “selective” in choosing whom to meet. Jamie Wiseman, an advocacy officer with the International Press Institute, said Serbia ranks among the countries in Europe to have the highest confirmed use of spyware against journalists, who face increasing legal lawsuits filed by senior officials and public figures. “These are clearly aimed at supressing legitimate public interest journalism on important matters,” Wiseman warned. Vucic’s government has stepped up pressure aimed at quelling the protests. He has called protesting university students “terrorists,” while Serbian media reported at least two foreign citizens have been ordered to leave the country over protest support. Speaking in Paris on Wednesday, Vucic criticized the private United Media group which owns N1 and Nova television stations that have extensively covered the demonstrations. The company is a “platform for conducting violence in Serbia,” Vucic said on Instagram. David Diaz-Jogeix, senior director of programs at the Article 19 organization, which campaign for freedom of expression, said that MFRR recommendations include a request to the EU to freeze an accession dialogue with Serbia and issue a public condemnation of the attacks and threats on journalists. Diaz-Jogeix urged “the Serbian authorities, but in particular we call on the President of Serbia, to cease all public attacks on journalists and media, including those covering protests.” The EU, he said, “needs to speak up.” “They cannot be business as usual,” Diaz-Jogeix warned.","Serbian press freedom faces 'critical' situation, media monitoring group warns",Jovana Gec,AP News,2025-04-09T15:56:50,2025-04-09T11:56:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-europe-trump-2c4f1519373803ac1f7c1744b69812d0,"BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union member states voted Wednesday to approve retaliatory tariffs on $23 billion in goods in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as the largest U.S. trading partner described them as “unjustified and damaging.” The tariffs will go into effect in stages, with some on April 15 and others on May 15 and Dec. 1. The EU executive commission didn’t immediately provide a list of the goods. Members of the 27-country bloc repeated their preference for a negotiated deal to settle trade issues. “The EU considers U.S. tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy,” the EU’s executive commission said in a statement. “The EU has stated its clear preference to find negotiated outcomes with the U.S., which would be balanced and mutually beneficial.” The targeted goods are a tiny fraction of the 1.6 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion) in U.S.-EU annual trade, which sees some 4.4 billion euros in goods and services cross the Atlantic each day in what the European Commission calls “the most important commercial relationship in the world.” The head of the EU’s executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has offered Trump a zero-for-zero tariffs deal on industrial goods including cars. But Trump has said that’s not enough to satisfy U.S. concerns. Trump’s expanded steel and aluminum tariffs came into effect in March. The EU has targeted smaller lists of goods in hopes of exerting political pressure and avoiding economic damage from a wider escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs. The EU is also working on a response to Trump’s blanket 20% tariff on all European goods, imposed as part of his sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on global trading partners. That could include measures aimed at U.S. tech companies and the services sector as well as trade in goods. France’s Economic Minister Eric Lombard said the second package “will take account not only of European imports, but also of other ways in which we can respond.” Speaking to legislators in the National Assembly in Paris, Lombard added that “the idea is that, with these extremely strong, extremely powerful measures, we can get to the negotiating table on an equal footing, so that both sides of these duties can be lowered and all our economic sectors protected.”","EU imposes new tariffs on $23 billion in US goods in retaliation for Trump's steel, aluminum tariffs","LORNE COOK, DAVID MCHUGH",AP News,2025-04-09T10:05:08,2025-04-09T11:20:19,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-849483,"Sebastián Basso, the lead prosecutor in the AMIA bombing case, has requested a national and international arrest warrant against Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei due to his direct involvement in the bombing of the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994, according to Argentinian daily Clarín on Wednesday. In 1994, the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina Jewish community center was bombed, killing 85 and wounding 300. Hezbollah is believed to be behind the attack, with Iranian backing and support. According to Basso, Khamenei “led the decision to carry out a bomb attack in Buenos Aires in July 1994 and issued executive order (fatwa) 39 to carry it out.” JPost Videos Basso requested of Argentinian Federal Judge Daniel Rafecas that Khamenei “be called to give a statement in relation to his involvement in the attack on the AMIA headquarters on July 18, 1994, along with the other Iranian suspects mentioned in this report.” Khamenei “sponsored an armed organization that operates clandestinely outside of Lebanese territory and is linked to the Hezbollah movement, which for decades has carried out numerous attacks on the lives and property of people that must be clarified as terrorist acts, including the AMIA attack,” Basso stated. Basso requested that Interpol be notified “for the purpose of executing the arrest.” He also ordered Argentina’s federal security forces to arrest Khamenei if he steps on Argentinian soil. Clarín noted that this represents a shift from the position of previous prosecutors and intelligence agents, who saw Khamenei as having immunity due to his official role. Khamenei’s immunity was based on a doctrine of par in parem non habet imperium, which means that equals have no jurisdiction over each other, thereby reinforcing the principle of the sovereign equality of states. This principle holds that one state cannot exercise its powers over, or interfere in, the lawful activities of another foreign state, Basso argued in the document obtained by Clarín. “In this context,” he added, “it is important to stress that the principle of immunity not only covers activities carried out by the state itself but also acts committed by high-ranking officials: heads of state, diplomatic and consular officers, foreign ministers, and other ministers on official overseas missions.” According to Basso, “It’s essential to clearly distinguish between the principle of state immunity, head of state immunity, and the immunities of diplomatic agents, consular officers, and certain cabinet members. It’s also important to note the sources of this principle, which has historically been governed by customary international law. However, as these distinct immunities evolved, conventional regulation emerged in certain cases. “In this regard, Article 27 of the Rome Statute establishes that no form of immunity can be invoked before the International Criminal Court, and its second section emphasizes the distinction between domestic and international immunities,” Basso said. Khamenei served as Iranian President from 1981 to 1989 before succeeding RuhollahKhomeinias Supreme Leader in 1989. Argentina and Iran have had only chargé d’affaires-level diplomatic relations since 1994, and this decision could further strain bilateral ties.",Argentina seeks arrest of Iran’s supreme leader over 1994 AMIA bombing,JERUSALEM POST STAFF,The Jerusalem Post,2025-04-09T10:40:32,2025-04-09T16:08:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/china-africa-gambia-malawi-taiwan-diplomacy-pressure-306aafddf26aae9ecccd5b8d7e5ff509,"BEIJING (AP) — Chinese diplomats threatened to cancel a summit and called top officials in two African countries to pressure lawmakers to quit an international parliamentary group critical of China, officials from the group told The Associated Press. It’s an example of how far China will go to influence politicians overseas, and how that pressure can succeed behind closed doors. In the past year, lawmakers from Malawi and Gambia withdrew from the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, or IPAC, a group of hundreds of lawmakers from 38 countries concerned about how democracies approach Beijing, according to letters, messages and voice recordings obtained by The Associated Press. Founded in 2020, the group has coordinated sanctions on China over rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and rallied support for Taiwan, a self-ruled democratic island Beijing claims as its territory. African politicians and experts say it’s an escalation of Chinese diplomatic pressure in Africa, where Beijing’s influence is growing. Beijing has built deep ties with African leaders by developing mines and building infrastructure through state-owned construction companies, often funded by loans from state-owned banks. The pressure is also part of Beijing’s longstanding effort to influence groups and lawmakers across the world, including in New York state, where a former governor’s aide faces charges for acting as an agent for the Chinese government. ‘Very shocking news’ In January, Gambian lawmaker Abdoulie Ceesay sent a voice message to an IPAC staffer saying the Chinese government had complained to the Gambian foreign ministry about his membership. “We have very shocking news … it’s a problem right now,” Ceesay said in the recording, which IPAC provided to AP. “The president is not happy with us at all.” Later the same month, Ceesay and fellow lawmaker Amadou Camara informed the alliance they were withdrawing. Ceesay told IPAC in a written message that his decision was “not influenced by the Chinese embassy,” a position Ceesay reiterated when contacted by AP. Gambia’s information minister said he was unaware of any attempt by China to influence his country’s politicians. “They decided on their own behalf to opt out of IPAC after realizing it goes against the government’s bilateral (relationship) with China,” said the minister, Ismaila Ceesay, who is not related to Abdoulie Ceesay. The Chinese government has targeted lawmakers over the alliance before. Beijing has sanctioned some members and last year, lawmakers from at least six countries were pressured by Chinese diplomats not to attend the group’s summit in Taiwan. Kenyan lawmakers cancelled their plans to attend but stayed in the alliance. The group was also targeted by Chinese state-sponsored hackers in 2021, according to a U.S. indictment. “Foreign legislators are being bullied out of a free alliance between them and other politicians,” said IPAC head Luke de Pulford. “This is clearly a result of Chinese pressure.” In a statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused IPAC of “smearing China” and said that “China has never engaged in coercive diplomacy.” But a Malawian lawmaker, Ephraim Abel Kayembe, told an IPAC staffer he had been contacted by the speaker of the Malawian National Assembly shortly after he and another lawmaker joined the group at last year’s Taiwan summit, according to the staffer. The staffer declined to be named for fear of damage to their relations with other politicians. Have a news tip? Contact AP’s global investigative team at investigative@ap.org. For secure and confidential communications, use the free Signal app +1 (202) 281-8604. The speaker told Kayembe the Chinese government had threatened to cancel the president’s upcoming visit to Beijing for a regional summit and meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, according to IPAC head de Pulford, programs director Tom Fraser and the person who spoke directly to Kayembe. Less than two weeks after the summit, the two Malawian lawmakers said they were withdrawing. Kayembe said in a letter to IPAC that he had been tricked into joining. “I want to extend my sincere apology to the People’s Republic of China,” Kayembe wrote in the Aug. 7 letter. When contacted by AP, Kayembe denied being coerced by the Malawi or Chinese governments, writing in an email that he withdrew because the alliance appeared “aimed at achieving geopolitical intentions against China.” Malawi’s government did not respond to a request for comment. Shifting alliances For decades, Beijing has cultivated ties with African governments, seeking diplomatic partners and access to natural resources. Many African leaders have welcomed Beijing’s presence since it brings much-needed capital and construction expertise that can contribute to economic growth and development. Critics say China strikes secretive, sometimes corrupt deals with African leaders that mainly benefit Chinese companies and workers brought in to build mines, bridges and railways. “China has been investing and being present in African countries when many countries were not willing to come,” said Christian-Geraud Neema, Africa editor of the China Global South Project, an independent research group. Chinese leaders have repeatedly promised not to interfere in the internal affairs of African countries, saying there are “no political strings attached” to its investment. But China has pressured African governments to shun Taiwan or Tibet’s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, efforts that Neema says appear to be escalating. Last October, South Africa demanded that Taipei move its unofficial embassy out of the administrative capital, Pretoria, and in January, Beijing sanctioned the head of South Africa’s second-largest political party for visiting Taiwan. Moves like these mirror efforts China has made against governments elsewhere in the past. Beijing blocked exports from Lithuania, for example, after the northern European country allowed Taiwan to open a trade office. But experts say the pressure against the IPAC members is unusual. Lina Benabdallah, a professor at Wake Forest University who studies China’s relations with Africa, said she has never heard of China using direct coercion against African parliamentarians before. “This is very new to me,” Benabdallah said. Zimbabwe lawmaker and IPAC member Daniel Molokele said he expects to see more coercive behavior from Beijing, especially as the Trump administration pulls back from Africa. “I expect China to benefit,” Molokele said. “It will definitely use this opportunity to grow its influence in Africa.” ___ Abdoulie John in Serrekunda, Gambia, and Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa, contributed to this report.",Beijing ups diplomatic pressure on Africa as the US pulls back,Dake Kang,AP News,2025-04-09T05:27:15,2025-04-09T01:27:15,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-china-soldiers-donetsk-captured-05a412aba1cfe13b623b2403db5db533,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine on Wednesday expanded on its claim that significant numbers of Chinese nationals are fighting for Russia’s invading army, saying it had gathered detailed intelligence on more than 150 mercenaries Moscow allegedly recruited through social media. In China, officials called the allegations “totally unfounded.” The Ukrainian accusation and Chinese denial come as the U.S. strives to secure a ceasefire in the more than three-year war. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced Tuesday that the Ukrainian military had captured two Chinese men fighting alongside the Russian army on Ukrainian soil. It was the first time Ukraine had made such a claim about Chinese fighters in the war. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said he was willing to exchange the two prisoners of war for Ukrainian soldiers held captive in Russia. Without providing evidence, Zelenskyy said officials in Beijing were aware of Russia’s campaign to recruit Chinese mercenaries. He stopped short of saying the Chinese government authorized the mercenaries’ involvement in Ukraine. Zelenskyy said Ukraine has the last names and passport data for 155 Chinese citizens fighting for the Russian army and that “we believe that there are many more of them.” He shared with journalists documents listing names, passport numbers and personal details of the alleged Chinese recruits, including when they arrived in Russia for military training and departed for service; the AP has not independently verified the documents. China has provided strong diplomatic support for Russia since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has also sold Russia machinery and microelectronics that it can use to make weapons, Western officials say, in addition to providing an economic lifeline through the trade in energy and consumer goods. China is not believed to have knowingly provided Russia with troops, weapons or military expertise. U.S. officials have accused Iran of providing Russia with drones, while American and South Korean officials say North Korea has sent thousands of troops and ammunition to help Russia on the battlefield. With the U.S. and Europe having provided substantial military support and diplomatic heft for Ukraine, the war has to some degree become a contest between power blocs. Tensions between the U.S. and China have deepened in recent years. Disputes have centered on geopolitical influence, technology and trade — and recently escalating import tariffs between the countries have roiled global financial markets. Zelenskyy said U.S. officials expressed “surprise” when informed of the presence of Chinese mercenaries in Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to follow through on a campaign promise last year to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said at a briefing in Washington on Tuesday that reports of Chinese citizens fighting on behalf of Russia were “disturbing.” “China is a major enabler of Russia in the war in Ukraine,” Bruce said. China provides nearly 80% of the dual-use items Russia needs to sustain the war, she claimed. But Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said he is “not convinced yet” the Chinese personnel identified as fighting on behalf of Russia against Ukraine are more than mercenaries or volunteers. “There’s an axiom in the military, the first report is always wrong,” Kellogg said during a Wednesday appearance at Georgetown University. “And this is one of those let’s sit back and see how this plays out, because it could be volunteers.” Kellogg noted that Ukraine also has volunteers from other countries, including the United States, fighting on its behalf. He added that the early reports of Chinese personnel are not on par with North Korea’s deployment of thousands of troops to the frontlines. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, also called Beijing “the key enabler of Russia’s war.” Dual-use goods are entering Russia via China, she said in Brussels, adding “it’s clear that if China would want to really stop the support then it would have an impact.” China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for the war, according to a U.S. assessment last year. The Kremlin has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting in Ukraine. The Kyiv government has consented to it. Both sides are believed to be readying spring-summer military campaigns. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in Beijing that China has played a “constructive role in politically resolving the Ukraine crisis.” Lin told a daily news briefing Wednesday that “the Chinese government always asks Chinese citizens to stay away from conflict zones, avoid getting involved in any form of armed conflict, and especially refrain from participating in any party’s military operations.” His comments appeared to indicate that the captured Chinese had joined Russia’s ranks on their own initiative. Both Russia and Ukraine allow foreign soldiers to enlist. China has previously put forward a vague peace plan that was swiftly dismissed by most observers. In the meantime, both countries have kept fighting a war of attrition along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and targeted each other with long-range strikes. The city of Kramatorsk in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk endured a “massive drone attack” overnight, regional head Vadym Filashkin said, injuring an 11-year-old girl, her mother and her grandmother. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 55 Shahed and decoy drones at the country overnight. The Russian Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 158 Ukrainian drones over 11 Russian regions overnight but reported no casualties or damage. Several Russian regions temporarily suspended flights at their airports because of the attack, however, and some Ukrainian drones reached Russia’s Orenburg region in the southern Urals located nearly 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) east of the Ukrainian border, the Defense Ministry said. ___ AP reporters Christopher Bodeen in Taipei, Taiwan, Lorne Cook in Brussels, and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at ",Zelenskyy says more than 150 Chinese mercenaries are fighting for Russia in Ukraine,SAMYA KULLAB,AP News,2025-04-09T09:18:56,2025-04-09T18:42:59,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/germany-merz-new-government-coalition-merz-berlin-591d8dfc11836e282ca8871ff41d0ffa,"BERLIN (AP) — German election winner Friedrich Merz sealed a deal Wednesday to form a new government that aims to spur economic growth, ramp up defense spending, take a tougher approach to migration and catch up on long-neglected modernization. The agreement paves the way for new leadership in the 27-nation European Union’s most populous member, which has Europe’s biggest economy. It follows months of political drift and weeks of negotiations as the continent faces uncertainty over the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs and its commitment to European allies’ defense. Merz is on track to become Germany’s new leader in early May, replacing outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The 69-year-old’s two-party Union bloc emerged as the strongest force from Germany’s election on Feb. 23. Merz turned to the Social Democrats, Scholz’s center-left party, to put together a coalition with a parliamentary majority. 




‘Germany is back on track’ Before Merz can take the helm, the coalition deal needs approval in a ballot of the Social Democrats’ membership and by a convention on April 28 of Merz’s Christian Democratic Union party. Once those hurdles are cleared, the lower house of parliament — in which the allies have 328 of the 630 seats — can elect him as chancellor. Merz said the deal is “a very strong and clear signal to the people of our country, and also a clear signal to our partners in the European Union: Germany is getting a government that is capable of acting and will act strongly.” Asked about his message to the U.S. president, Merz replied: “The key message to Donald Trump is, Germany is back on track. Germany will fulfill the obligations in terms of defense and Germany is willing to strengthen their own competitiveness.” He added, “We will bring the European Union forward.” The prospective coalition embarked on one big project before even reaching a deal to govern together. Last month, it pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt, and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that’s aimed at boosting the stagnant economy. That was an about-turn for Merz, whose party had spoken out against running up new debt before the election without entirely closing the door to future changes to Germany’s self-imposed “debt brake.”


Economy and migration Other measures in the agreement are more in line with what he campaigned for. The coalition aims to boost companies’ investment and then cut corporate tax, make working overtime more attractive and cut electricity tax. Merz, the opposition leader at the time, made reducing migration central to his election campaign. On Wednesday, he said the new government will suspend family reunions for many migrants, designate more “safe countries of origin,” launch a “return offensive” for rejected asylum-seekers and turn some people back at Germany’s borders in consultation with neighbors. It will also tighten a law passed by the outgoing government that eased the rules for gaining citizenship, scrapping the possibility for well-integrated applicants to get a German passport after three rather than five years of residence. 


Throw out the fax machines The new government will include a “digitization ministry” to modernize a country that still has a reputation for tangled bureaucracy and old-fashioned paperwork. “Not everything has to be regulated down to the smallest detail,” said the Social Democrats’ co-leader, Lars Klingbeil. “The diggers must work and the fax machines in our country must be thrown away. Our economy must grow.” Merz said the coalition plans to reduce the size of the federal administration by 8% over its four-year term. But, referring to the United States’ Department of Government Efficiency, he said it doesn’t plan to do so by firing workers. “We’re not hiring an Elon Musk here who will do it like they do in Washington,” he said. “We will do it ... sensibly, with a sense of proportion.”


Pressure from abroad and at home The election took place seven months earlier than planned after Scholz’s unpopular coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting and widespread discontent. Germany, the 27-nation European Union’s most populous member, has been in political limbo since then. The market turbulence caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs added to pressure for Merz’s Union and the Social Democrats to bring their coalition talks to a conclusion. The tariffs threaten to add to the woes of an export-heavy economy that shrank for the past two years.
 Another factor in the haste to reach an agreement was a decline for the Union in the opinion polls, showing support slipping from its election showing, while the far-right Alternative for Germany, which finished a strong second in February, gained as the political vacuum persisted. “The political center in our country is in a position to solve the problems we face,” Merz said. Ministers will be named at a later date.",German parties agree to form a new government after months of drift in Europe’s biggest economy,GEIR MOULSON,AP News,2025-04-09T10:10:25,2025-04-09T11:19:36,gemini-2.0-flash

Kim Yo-jong, vice department director of the ruling party's central committee, issued the statement Wednesday in response to the outcome of last week's trilateral meeting of the three countries' foreign ministers. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearizing North Korea on the margins of a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) last Thursday. Kim claimed the joint pledge only revealed the uneasiness of the three countries about addressing North Korea's denuclearization, saying they know it is only ""a daydream that can never come true."" ""If they frantically cry out for 'denuclearization,' really believing in it, they must be termed nonsensical,"" she noted in the statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). North Korea's status as ""a nuclear weapons state"" is ""a result of the inevitable option which accurately reflected the hostile threat from outside and the change in the present and future world security mechanical structure,"" she also claimed. ""So it does not change no matter how desperately anyone denies."" For North Korea, discussing the dismantlement of its nuclear weapons or reviving the ""dead concept of denuclearization"" only constitutes ""the most hostile act of denying"" its sovereignty and attempting to force it ""to renounce its constitution and social system,"" according to Kim. ""If the U.S. and its vassal forces continue to insist on anachronistic 'denuclearization' while talking about 'threat' from someone, it will only give unlimited justness and justification to the advance"" of North Korea's pursuit of the ""strongest nuclear force for self-defense,"" she added.

The strikes hit around Hodeida’s al-Hawak District, the rebels say. The area is home to the city’s airport, which the rebels have used in the past to target shipping in the Red Sea. Since its start, the intense campaign of US airstrikes targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters — related to the Israel-Hamas war — has killed at least 75 people, according to casualty figures released by the Houthis. Footage aired by the rebels’ al-Masirah satellite news channel shows chaotic scenes of people carrying wounded to waiting ambulances and rescuers searching by the light of their mobile phones. The target appears in the footage to be a home in a residential neighborhood, likely part of a wider decapitation campaign launched by the Trump administration to kill rebel leaders. Other strikes target Yemen’s mountainous Amran governorate, north of the rebel-held capital of Sanaa. There, the Houthis describe American strikes hitting telecommunication equipment. Previous US strikes also targeted telecommunications gear in Amran near Jebel Aswad, or the “Black Mountain.” The US military’s Central Command, which oversees American military operations, doesn’t immediately acknowledge the strikes. That follows a pattern for the command, which now has authorization from the White House to conduct strikes at will in the campaign that began March 15",Houthis report 2 killed in suspected US strikes on Yemen port city of Hodeida,AP,The Times of Israel,2025-04-08T23:53:16,2025-04-09T00:36:44,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.thetimes.com/world/middle-east/article/iran-arming-proxy-forces-iraq-long-range-missiles-5wpdx0w82?msockid=3a66ed9bf9b764691eb8f8e6f84c655f,"Iran has transferred long-range missiles to its proxy forces in Iraq for the first time, increasing the regime’s military footprint in the region even as President Trump threatens to hold Tehran accountable for the actions of its militia. The Times has learnt that Tehran has been bulking up its presence in the region by supplying a new batch of weapons to powerful Shia militias in Iraq, dashing hopes that Iran would withdraw support as it prepares to enter negotiations with the United States over its missile and nuclear programme. The weapons were transferred last week, according to regional intelligence involved in monitoring the nearly 1,000-mile border between the countries. It was the first time long-range surface-to-surface missiles had been in the possession of an Iran-allied militia in Iraq. Sources said the delivery was arranged by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Air Force. Iran is set to head into the first official negotiations over its nuclear programme with the United States since President Trump scrapped the Obama nuclear accord in 2018. Iran has widely been viewed as greatly weakened in recent years, having lost air defences around nuclear sites after a confrontation with Israel in October and with the fall of its proxies — Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — and the toppling of the Assad regime in Syria. Speaking to Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump urged Tehran to agree a deal during the negotiations, which were expected to take place in Oman. “If the talks aren’t successful, I actually think it’ll be a very bad day for Iran,” he said. However, sources said that two other types of missiles, the Quds 351 cruise and Jamal 69 ballistic missiles, were also smuggled into Iraq last week. They had a much shorter range than the new surface-to-surface missiles, which could be positioned to target as far as Europe. “Iran has recently transferred missiles to Shia militias in Iraq, including new models with longer range, which have not been given in the past to those militias. It’s a desperate move by the Iranians, risking the stability of Iraq,” a regional intelligence source said. The Houthi rebel group in Yemen and the Iran-allied militias in Iraq are seen as the last forces fighting on behalf of the regime in Iran. The US has been striking key Houthi targets in the past few weeks, on Tuesday killing a senior intelligence leader, Abdul Nasser al-Kamali. Iraq has its own separatist armed groups allied with Iran, which can be traced back to the rule of Saddam Hussein and have a staunchly anti-American stance, particularly since the US invasion of 2003, where they launched deadly attacks. In January last year, the militia group Kataib Hezbollah killed three American military personnel in Jordan. The US retaliated with a drone strike that killed its leader, Abu Baqir al-Saadi, leading the group to suspend attacks to prevent “embarrassment” to the Iraqi government. • Iran warns neighbours not to help US if it attacks The Iraqi government, which still hosts American forces, has clamped down on terror groups including Islamic State, leading Iran-allied militia to hunker down under pressure first from Washington, which has bolstered forces across the region before any potential confrontation, and also from the Islamic Republic itself, which has warned neighbouring states that any compliance with the US, including allowing the use of their airspace, will be held to account. The development runs contrary to reports this week from Iraqi officials and senior commanders who said that the Iranian-backed militia in Iraq was “prepared to disarm” to avert potential conflict with America. One senior Shia politician close to the Iraqi government told Reuters the groups were intending to comply with US calls to disarm to avoid being targeted. “The factions are not acting stubbornly or insisting on continuing in their current form,” Izzat al-Shahbndar said, adding that discussions between the prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and several militia leaders were “very advanced”. Soon after the comments were made public, an Iraqi political source told the Saudi-owned media organisation Al Arabiya that the armed factions had in fact refused to disarm. “The efforts seen in the last 48 hours to create a picture that the militias are disarming is a ruse,” a diplomatic source in the region told The Times. “The Iraqi militia knows what it is doing and is concerned about internal Iraqi opposition. There are discussions in Iraq, among politicians but also in the public sphere on social media, against importing Iran’s problems to their home turf. They look at Lebanon and are actively trying to avoid that.” • Iran has every incentive to make a nuclear deal with Trump Analysts said Iran was “scrambling” to regain its foothold in the Middle East, leading its remaining proxies to try to hedge their bets. “Some of the militia leaders have been in talks with the Iraqi government about demilitarising their struggle and joining the political process. I think some proxies are losing faith in Iran to support them in the long term,” William Alberque, a visiting fellow at the Stimson Centre, said. On the other hand, he added, it made sense that Iran would “escalate its support to the militias to try to convince them to break off talks and continue fighting”. He said: “However, it is also possible that they will pocket the assistance and use it as leverage in negotiations rather than continue a longer-term and very costly and dangerous fight. “Iran has no reason to give up its proxy tool, as it continues to reap benefits, both in destabilisation, but also because this creates opportunities for Iran through ungoverned spaces — including organised crime and other smuggling vectors.”",Iran defies Trump by arming proxy forces in Iraq with missiles,Gabrielle Weiniger,The Times,2025-04-08T11:45:58,2025-04-09T04:55:13,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9281ljxj0o,"South Sudan has said it will now allow the entry of a man deported from the US, in a dramatic climb down aimed at defusing a visa row between the two countries. On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US would be revoking US visas for all South Sudanese. He said it was a response to South Sudan's refusal to accept the return of its citizens being removed from the US. In its initial reaction, South Sudan's foreign ministry said the move was based on a case involving someone who had been incorrectly identified as South Sudanese and was sent back as a result. The government now says it will allow the man to enter the country ""in the spirit of the friendly relations"". It adds that the deported man, identified as being from the Democratic Republic of Congo, could arrive in the capital, Juba, as early as Wednesday. ""As a result of this decision, the government has instructed the relevant authorities at Juba International Airport to facilitate [his] arrival,"" South Sudan's foreign ministry said in Tuesday's statement. Referring to other possible removals, the ministry said the country was committed to supporting the return of its ""verified nationals"" who are scheduled for deportation from the US. The US move at the weekend was the first time the US targeted all passport holders from a particular country since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, having campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, with the promise of ""mass deportations"". In his statement on Saturday, Rubio said that the US would also block any arriving citizens of South Sudan, the world's newest country, at US ports of entry. He blamed ""the failure of South Sudan's transitional government to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner"". ""We will be prepared to review these actions when South Sudan is in full cooperation,"" he added. But in a statement on Monday, South Sudan's foreign ministry said it ""deeply regrets"" the blanket measure against all of the country's citizens based on ""an isolated incident involving misrepresentation by an individual who is not a South Sudanese national"". It said the man at the centre of the visa row was a Congolese national and he was returned to the US. It added that all supporting evidence was shared with American officials. But Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau dismissed South Sudan's explanation as ""legally irrelevant"", saying the African country's embassy in Washington ""certified this particular individual as one of their nationals"". ""It is unacceptable and irresponsible for South Sudanese government officials to second guess the determination of their own embassy,"" Landau added. South Sudan's Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told the AP news agency that the US was ""attempting to find faults with the tense situation"" in the country because no sovereign nation would accept foreign deportees. This row comes as fears grow that South Sudan may again descend into civil war after the country's First Vice-President Riek Machar had been placed under house arrest. South Sudan's President Salva Kiir accused Machar of stirring up a new revolt. Last month, the US ordered all its non-emergency staff in South Sudan to leave as fighting broke out in one part of the country, threatening a fragile peace deal agreed in 2018 that ended a five-year civil war. South Sudanese in the US were previously granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allowed them to remain in the US for a set period of time. TPS for South Sudanese in the US had been due to expire by 3 May.",South Sudan to accept man deported from US in bid to defuse visa row,Akisa Wandera & Wycliffe Muia,BBC News,2025-04-08T04:07:08,2025-04-08T08:14:48,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-849277,"The United States continued its airstrikes in Hodeidah, Marib, and the Houthi-run capital city of Sana'a in Yemen, Houthi-linked media outlets reported on Monday night. The Houthi movement claimed that its senior intelligence leader, Abdul Nasser Al-Kamali, was killed in the strike, Al Hadath reported. US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Prime Minister Sudani in a phone call on March 16, shortly after the American strikes on the Houthis began, to prevent the militias carrying out revenge attacks on Israel and US bases in the region in support of their allies, according to two government officials and two security sources briefed on the exchange. Last week, the White House said that US strikes in Yemen earlier this month killed the Houthi top missile expert, but the US military has so far declined to confirm the death, and the identity of the Houthi commander in question is unclear.

https://www.politico.eu/article/friedrich-merz-germany-christian-democratic-union-social-democratic-party-coalition-talks/,"BERLIN — Friedrich Merz has yet to begin his chancellorship, but he’s already feeling the heat. The incoming leader is facing slumping approval ratings and a barrage of criticism from parts of his conservative base who believe he is yielding to the will of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) during coalition talks. Merz’s critics say he is failing to make good on pre-election vows to move his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) sharply to the right in key policy areas. The dissent within the ranks has spilled out into the open in recent days after members of the conservative bloc’s youth organization in the city of Cologne wrote a letter to Merz venting their dismay. “Mr. Merz, we believed in your political leadership. We trusted you. And we have fought for you,” the letter read. “But we are now asking the question: for what? For a CDU that submits to the left-wing mainstream?” After years of weak, divided government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, many European leaders had hoped Merz would provide stronger German leadership within the European Union. Merz too has vowed to provide that leadership in light of the challenges posed by U.S. President Donald Trump, vowing after his victory in the Feb. 23 snap election “to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA.” But Merz’s recent political difficulties have left him injured, a weakened leader who may have to spend more time attempting to repair his damaged image at home. Already Germany’s conservative bloc is dropping in the polls while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) — set to become Germany’s biggest opposition party when the new Bundestag convenes — is benefiting from the incoming chancellor’s new vulnerability. Germany’s latest benchmark Deutschlandtrend poll shows support for Merz’s conservative bloc dropping three percentage points to 26 percent and the AfD gaining by the same margin to reach 24 percent support, its strongest-ever result. Perhaps even more concerning for Merz, only 25 percent of Germans approve of his performance, down 10 percentage points from February, when the conservatives won the national election. Merz’s recent political problems began when he reached a historic agreement with the SPD and the Greens to unleash as much as €1 trillion in new spending for defense and infrastructure over the next decade, including €100 billion for Germany’s green transition. While Germany’s dramatic move to reverse more than 15 years
of self-imposed austerity drew approval abroad, many domestic conservatives quietly smarted, believing that Merz —
who had preached a conservative gospel of fiscal discipline ahead of the election — had given his center-left opponents the debt-fueled spending they’d long advocated. The move also opened him up to fierce attacks from the AfD, whose leaders accused Merz of betraying his own voters. “What do you actually stand for, Mr. Merz?” one of the AfD’s leaders, Tino Chrupalla, asked in parliament. “By now, you have the mRNA of the SPD implanted in you.”
Germany ‘will suffer massive damage’
Much of the criticism of Merz is coming from his conservative bloc’s youth organization, the Young Union. Johannes Winkel, the chair of the organization who also also sits on the CDU board, threatened to vote against a coalition agreement with the SPD that doesn’t deliver on core conservative policies. He demanded a crackdown on migration and the restoration of economic competitiveness by cutting regulation and bureaucracy. “If we enter into a coalition without the overdue and promised policy change, the country will suffer massive damage,” he said in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung daily.

The youth organization in Cologne demanded that Merz follow through on his pre-election pledges to reject asylum seekers at the border, reject tax increases, and institute “a massive reduction” in bureaucracy, all policies the SPD has resisted to varying degrees. “If this course is not corrected immediately, you will not only jeopardize the CDU’s profile — you will destroy the trust of the people and the commitment of its members,” the conservative youth wrote. The problem for Merz, however, is that he doesn’t have much leverage to force the SPD to bend to the will of conservatives. His massive spending plan has already given the SPD much of what it wanted, and having ruled out an alliance with the AfD, he has no other viable coalition partner. In recent days Merz has been trying to placate his dissatisfied base, addressing their core concerns as Trump’s tariffs wreak havoc in Europe and beyond. “The situation on the international equity and bond markets is dramatic and threatens to get worse,” Merz told Reuters. “It’s more important than ever for Germany to restore its competitiveness. That must be at the heart of coalition talks.” But as Europe faces its most challenging moment since the Cold War, it’s far from clear Merz will emerge from those talks with the political capital he needs to rise to the occasion.",Germany’s Merz is already in political trouble,James Angelos,POLITICO,2025-04-07T22:01:00,2025-04-08T04:54:05,gemini-2.0-flash

The National Election Commission began early candidate registration shortly after the Constitutional Court dismissed Yoon last Friday. If the schedule is confirmed, candidates will be required to register by May 11 and the official campaign period will kick off on May 12. The law also requires a public servant running for president to resign at least 30 days before an election, making May 4 the deadline for their run.

https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-sabotage-undersea-cables-baltic-sea-europe-war/,"Suspicious Russian tankers keep slashing Europe's internet and power cables.Â
It's not an act of war â
¦ but someday it might be. Before Russia bulldozed its way into Ukraine, Ilja Iljin mainly hunted for people stranded at sea. Now, he also hunts saboteurs.Â
Iljin, a deputy commander of Finland’s coast guard, is increasingly on the lookout for tankers about to commit sabotage. Behind him is a small army: dozens of radars and cameras, numerous patrol boats, a fleet of planes and helicopters â
all deployed to scour a stretch of water as large as Belgium.Â
They’re looking for suspicious behavior that could imperil the undersea cables that bring internet and power to Europeans.Â
And yet, sabotage keeps happening — twice in the Gulf of Finland alone in the last 18 months, according to Iljin. In total, the Baltic Sea has registered at least six suspected sabotage incidents since 2022, with 11 known undersea cables taken out since 2023.
“This is becoming more common,” Iljin said, standing in the cabin of the 23-meter-long patrol vessel, waves chopping against its sides. “We have become more aware of the risk, and we’re currently trying to figure out ways for how to properly respond.”
The damage hasn’t disrupted society. The lights stayed on; the Wi-Fi still worked. But they still sent a chill through Europe: What if the next vigilantes were more coordinated, more severe? What if Russia was launching an assault on Europe? What if it meant war?Â
A tumultuous scenario is not hard to envision. Ireland could lose a 10th of its electricity via three cable cuts. Norway feeds the European Union a third of the bloc’s gas through underwater pipelines. Going after either target could wreak chaos —Â
energy shortages, runaway prices, forced choices over who loses power.
“We are witnessing … [a] new reality,” said Lithuanian Energy Minister Å½ygimantas VaiÄ
diÅ«nas. “We have more and more incidents in the Baltic Sea, which could have an impact for markets, for consumers and also for our businesses.”
So far, authorities have failed to conclusively show Moscow was behind any of the incidents. But “such sabotage activities in the current circumstances could be seen as useful for Russia … that’s the only interpretation,” VaiÄ
diÅ«nas told POLITICO.
For Russia, the drumbeat of even minimal damage helps feed Western insecurity —Â
and plant the idea that, true or not, Moscow could upend Europeans’ daily life if it wanted.
Europe’s waters, in other words, have become a new front in the warming Cold War with Russia.
The EU and NATO are racing to tackle the problem, rolling out plans to buy spare cables and drones and beef up military surveillance. But Donald Trump is sparking fears that the situation will only get worse, as the United States’ president trashes America’s core alliances and parrots Russian talking points.
“They’ve been emboldened,” said one EU diplomat, who was granted anonymity to speak freely. “So it just means that we have to get serious.”
Finding cracks
The EU faced its first rude awakening in late 2022.Â
In September of that year, the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream pipelines were mysteriously blown up. Reports have since linked the incident to Ukrainian nationals, though the criminal case is ongoing.
Since then, Baltic Sea sabotage has proliferated, hitting telecom, gas and power links connecting Sweden, Finland, Germany, Latvia and Estonia. Just a few weeks ago, a communications cable linking Berlin and Helsinki was again damaged off the Swedish coast.Â
It’s a simple operation to pull off.Â
To start, the costs are extraordinarily low. “Potentially, it’s just bribing a captain to lower the anchor,” said Christian Bueger, an international relations professor and maritime security expert at the University of Copenhagen. “That’s really cheap if you’re thinking about military-style, security operations.”Â
The target is also easily within reach of a ship’s anchor. The Baltic Sea is only 52 meters deep on average, while the Gulf of Finland is even shallower at 38 meters. Compare that to the Mediterranean Sea at 1,500 meters.
Then, the cables themselves are simple to cut.Â
Subsea data cables —Â
which carry the world’s emails, WhatsApps and Zoom meetings — are minuscule, roughly an arm’s thickness wide and weighing just 3 kilograms, according to Volker Wendt, secretary-general of the Europacable trade body.Â
Underwater power connections —Â
which link both countries and offshore wind turbines — are made to withstand the harsh subsea environment. They’re about as wide as a guitar, protected by layers of insulation and steel and weigh up to 65 kilograms, Wendt said.Â
The cables, buried half a meter under the seafloor, are built to last 40 years and withstand trawling from fishnets —Â
but not an anchor’s direct hit. That’s exactly what happened with the Eagle S, a vessel that dragged its anchor 100 kilometers until it cut several cables near Finland in December.
Once severed, repairs are challenging, according to Bueger, the maritime expert.Â
Repair ships “are relatively limited globally,” he said, with only around 80 available worldwide. And even after arriving on site, fixes can take up to two weeks for data cables and “many months” for power cables, according to Peter Jamieson, vice chair of the European Subsea Cables Association.Â
The price tag? Between €5 million and €150 million, according to Bueger.
That’s a lot of money and time for something that’s essentially impossible to stop. Around 15 percent of the world’s total sea traffic moves through the Baltic Sea, which stretches almost 400,000 square kilometers — larger than Germany. Hordes of drones, radars and sailors can’t catch every rogue agent.
“It’s impossible to be everywhere at the same time,” said Marko Laaksonen, deputy chief of staff of operations in Finland’s navy.Â
So far, Western intelligence suggests some of the incidents were, in fact, accidental. But experts have raised doubts about others, especially where Russia’s allies are involved, such as the Chinese-registered Yi Peng 3 tanker that severed two undersea cables last November.Â
Either way, Moscow loves to exploit uncertainty, according to Nick Childs, a maritime defense expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.
“In a situation in which you’re not actually at war, there is the plausible deniability,” he said. “Russia may be seeking to raise its game in … the gray zone below actual conflict, as a kind of deterrent and warning signal to Western governments, not to escalate their support for Ukraine.”
It’s the same tactic Moscow uses elsewhere. Western officials suspect Russia’s hand in arson attacks and parcel bombs sent across Europe, as well as mounting disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks. Just last month, a Belarusian man was accused of setting fire to a Polish supermarket on Russia’s behalf. All low-level violence with some degree of deniability.
Officials are now adding undersea sabotage to that list.
“What we’re seeing is clearly an escalation,” said Bueger, and “a strategic attempt to undermine the stability and enhance the feeling of vulnerability and uncertainty in Western societies.”Â
“We’re going to see more of these attacks,” he added.Â
Low effort, high reward
To this point, the seaborne vandalism has caused limited disruptions. The EU’s power network is among the most well-connected in the world and companies build redundant links to curb the risk of supply shortages.
Instead, “much of the impact is actually on the societal level,” Bueger said. Such incidents often enhance public anxiety and feed “populist narratives in terms of protecting ourselves, looking inward rather than outward.”Â
In 2024, however, Estonia got a glimpse of what might happen in a more severe attack when technical glitches in one cable caused energy bills to spike by 10 percent, said Erkki Sapp, a board member of the country’s state-owned power grid operator Elering.
Imagine if that wasn’t just one power cable or had happened alongside massive data cable destruction. Then, add cyberattacks to the equation.Â
“We can handle any single event, any single problem with energy infrastructure,” Sapp said. “But also if there are several of these sorts of events, then this may lead to issues with security of supply.”
The repercussions could also grow if the attacks spread elsewhere across Europe — especially as the U.S. continues to retreat from its Western allies.
Like its Baltic neighbor, the North Sea is shallow — averaging depths of just 95 meters, leaving it exposed to similar acts of sabotage, according to Phuc-Vinh Nguyen, who heads the Paris-based Jacques Delors Energy Centre.Â
That’s where the vital gas pipelines connecting Norway and mainland Europe lie.
“If you were able to target one infrastructure [link] between Norway and the EU … the supply disruption and effect on prices would lead to a chaotic scenario,” Nguyen said.Â
Most exposed are the EU’s islands, he added.Â
Ireland is one, with its limited power links to the continent. The country is also less capable of monitoring sabotage Â
because neither does it have submarines or military radars, nor is it part of the NATO military alliance. Malta, too, has just one subsea electricity link that provides a quarter of the island’s power.
In a worst-case scenario, Nguyen said, Moscow would time a gas cutoff with pipeline cable ruptures in mid-winter.Â
At that point, he said, “it’s big crisis time.” Sky-high prices. Countries slashing exports to hoard supplies. Consumers losing energy access.Â
Given Europe’s deadlocked standoff with Russia, that’s a “possibility you can’t rule out,” Nguyen said.Â
The tensions aren’t just with Russia. Trump, the U.S. president, is shaking the very concept of a collective, coordinated Western defense. Assurances once seen as ironclad —Â
U.S. troops will defend Europe, transatlantic militaries will cooperate —Â
feel increasingly anachronistic. Late last month, Reuters reported the U.S. had quit a joint effort with Europe to counter Russian sabotage.
“Europe relies on quite a few U.S. surveillance capabilities,” Nguyen said, and “particularly after the Nord Stream incidents, [that] highlighted the fact that Western countries had clearly had a deficit in terms of monitoring this infrastructure.”
That spying equipment isn’t easily replaced. And Russia would know that.
“An unraveling of the transatlantic security relationship …Â
might be an encouragement to the Russians to cause mischief,” said Childs, the maritime defense expert.Â
Subsea solutions
The situation is jolting Europe into action.Â
In January, NATO announced it would deploy frigates, maritime patrol planes and a naval drone fleet to monitor the region as part of a new “Baltic Sentry” program. That came after the alliance set up a new maritime center last year to track critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.
“We are putting substantially more military assets into the area,” said James Appathurai, NATO deputy assistant secretary-general for hybrid and cyber. “More presence, more surveillance, more robust action … should deter ship captains and crew who will be more likely to be caught.”
The EU is also stepping up its efforts.Â
In February, Brussels said it would spend an extra €540 million on new infrastructure by 2027, including subsea connections, as part of a strategy to protect essential cables. The EU also plans to stock up on spare cables and buy dedicated repair vessels for fixing breaks.
“The European Union is … willing and capable also to support and help [its] member states,”Â
European Commission Executive Vice President for Security Henna Virkkunen told POLITICO.Â
“It’s the first part of preparedness that we are not dependent on one connection,” she added, arguing that tackling subsea threats formed part of the EU’s new disaster prepare-and-response plan published last week.
Countries bordering the Baltic Sea are also taking things into their own hands.Â
Finland treats energy infrastructure protection as part of its defense planning — a “total security approach,” said Finnish Environment Minister Sari Multala. The country is exploring buying more repair capacity.
“Having a long border with Russia and also our history,” she added. “We have to be prepared always for the worst.”
Estonia and Lithuania, meanwhile, are mulling draft laws to seize vessels threatening critical infrastructure outside their territorial waters. And the United Kingdom has launched an artificial intelligence scheme that assesses tanker risks through publicly available data on ship movements.
“Our people feel this as an attack to our critical infrastructure,” Estonian Climate Minister Yoko Alender told POLITICO. “The fundamental principle here is European security and independence.”
But crafting an effective response also means entering a legal minefield.
Under international law, countries have few powers to seize suspicious vessels outside their territorial waters — or 12 nautical miles away from their shores, said Sean Pribyl, a partner specializing in international maritime law at Holland & Knight.
Beyond that zone, the ship has the legal right to “innocent passage” and is subject to the laws in the country where it is registered, he said, its so-called flag state.Â
That’s a problem, Pribyl said, because “there’s no policing mechanism” that forces those flag states —Â
often far away and with loose diplomatic ties to Western countries — to take action against suspicious vessels.
The Yi Peng 3 is a case in point. Despite docking between Sweden and Denmark, Beijing refused to allow local authorities to conduct a full investigation of the vessel.
Back on the patrol vessel off the Finnish coast, a powerful wind hammered against the cabin windows. Iljin, the Finnish coast guard chief, expressed fear at how perilously Russian cargo ships were behaving.Â
“These are very shallow waters … so if these vessels have engine problems, for example, they lose maneuverability,” he said, “and then it might hit the ground in a number of hours.”
And Iljin can’t track them properly. “Some of them seem to manipulate their [transponder] devices … which sort of makes them invisible,” he said.Â
So for Iljin, it’s not even a choice. Europe has to adapt to this new reality.
“We are obviously aware [of] where these undersea cables are,” he said. “It’s something that we have prepared for.”

The ASEAN+3 Finance and Central Bank Deputies' Meeting will take place in the Malaysian capital on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which senior officials will review key agenda items for the upcoming meeting among their finance ministers scheduled to be held in Italy on May 4, according to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. South Korea will send Deputy Finance Minister Choi Ji-young to this week's meeting as its chief delegate, it added. On the table will be how to better develop their Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM), a US$240 billion pool launched in 2010 that can be tapped through currency swap deals in times of financial crises. A currency swap is a tool meant to defend against financial turmoil by allowing a country beset by a liquidity crunch to borrow money from others with its own currency. The participants will also exchange views on the global and regional economic situation and policy responses, the ministry said.

https://apnews.com/article/colombia-peace-talks-eln-commoners-south-disarmament-df5e48c62815d7ba7480e760cc2846b1,"PASTO, Colombia (AP) — A rebel group called the Commoners of the South has begun handing its weapons over to Colombia’s government, the Defense Ministry said Saturday, as part of peace talks expected to lead to the group’s disarmament in the coming months. The group of about 250 fighters operates in Colombia’s Southwestern Nariño province and has been in negotiations with the government since last year. “This is a historic moment,” Defense Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a ceremony in the town of Pasto, where several accords with the group were outlined by officials. Sanchez said that over the past two days, the Commoners of the South have handed over land mines, grenades and rockets to an army unit that is destroying them. “Farmers will be able to walk without the fear of coming across a minefield,” Sanchez said. Until recently, the Commoners of the South was part of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, a group of about 6,000 fighters that is still fighting Colombia’s government. In May last year, the Commoners broke away from the ELN and began peace talks with the administration of President Gustavo Petro. That angered the ELN’s leadership and stymied its negotiations with Colombia’s government. Petro, who was part of a rebel group in his youth, has been staging peace talks with nine separate rebel groups and drug trafficking gangs in Colombia under a strategy known as “total peace.” Most of these negotiations have failed to reduce violence and so far only the Commoners of the South have agreed to begin a transition toward civilian life. “The Commoners of the South are only one of nine problems” faced by the Petro administration, said Gerson Arias, an analyst at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think tank in Bogota. “And they are only a small and marginal segment of Colombia’s armed groups,” he said. Arias said the government has been trying to reach regional agreements with smaller factions of rebel groups that can take some pressure off the population, instead of larger, national accords. “The talks with the Commoners of the South, are the only ones that may end up succeeding” in the Petro administration, Arias said. But he added that some issues still need to be resolved, such as the legal mechanisms through which victims of the group will be able to seek justice and truth. In 2016, Colombia signed a peace deal with the nation’s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in which more than 13,000 fighters laid down their weapons. But the FARC’s withdrawal from some rural areas created a power vacuum that smaller groups have tried to fill. Colombia’s government is now struggling to provide security in remote rural areas, where various groups are fighting over drug trafficking routes and natural resources, while they forcibly recruit minors and tax local businesses to raise funds. Earlier this year, more than 50,000 people were displaced from their homes in Catatumbo, a region along Colombia’s border with Venezuela, after the ELN attacked villages where it accused farmers of supporting a rival group. The Colombian government suspended peace talks with the ELN following those attacks, with Petro accusing its leaders of becoming “greedy” drug traffickers who have betrayed their revolutionary ideals. In Nariño, which is located along Colombia’s border with Ecuador, local officials are hoping that Colombia’s government keeps rebel groups away from the area, by providing greater security and economic development projects. “If a peace deal is reached between the Commoners of the South and the government, we would like to know more about the strategy to protect this territory” said Giovanny Cardenas, a human rights official in the town of Samaniego. “It would be tragic if this group demobilizes and another group comes here to continue the same war.” ___ Rueda reported from Bogota, Colombia.",A rebel group begins handing weapons over to the Colombian government as peace talks advance,"Astrid Suarez, Manuel Rueda",AP News,2025-04-05T17:21:23,2025-04-05T17:21:23,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/russia-american-tater-psychiatric-hospital-b6c80b9198ab3ccd803ebbe88af6e94f,"MOSCOW (AP) — A U.S. citizen awaiting trial in Moscow has been forcibly admitted to a psychiatric hospital, Russian state media reported Sunday. Joseph Tater, 46, was arrested in August 2024 after being accused of assaulting a police officer during a confrontation with staff at an upmarket hotel in the Russian capital. A Moscow court agreed to admit Tater to a psychiatric hospital non-voluntarily after a medical evaluation on March 15, Russian state news agency Tass reported. It said that doctors had described Tater as displaying signs of “tension, impulsivity, persecutory delusions, and lack of self-awareness regarding his condition.” The U.S. Embassy in Moscow declined to comment on the case, citing privacy concerns. Tater had been due to stand trial on April 14 on charges of assaulting a police officer, which is punishable with a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment. It is unclear when the court made its decision to detain him on medical grounds, but Tass previously reported that he had been released from pre-trial detention at the end of March. At a September court hearing, Tater claimed he came to Russia to seek political asylum and that he was being persecuted by the CIA. Tater’s defense lawyer has appealed his forced hospitalization, accusing officials of trying to “isolate the defendant from society,” Tass reported. Human rights groups have repeatedly accused Russia of forcing citizens into psychiatric institutions due to their political views — a Soviet-era practice they say has been increasingly used by President Vladimir Putin’s government. Tater has already served 15 days in jail for the same incident after being found guilty on administrative charges of “petty hooliganism.” He was detained in August 2024 when he became abusive to hotel staff who requested to see his documents, Russian state news agencies reported. They reported that Tater swore and “behaved aggressively” when the hotel refused to accommodate him, and later grabbed the arm of a police officer called to the scene. Tater is just one of several Americans detained in Russia on drug or assault convictions, with many serving sentences of several years. They include Robert Gilman, 72, who was handed 3 1 sentence at the age of 72 after being found guilty of assaulting a police officer following a drunken disturbance on a train, and Travis Leake, a musician who was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 13 years in prison in July 2024.",Moscow court sends US citizen awaiting trial to a psychiatric hospital,,AP News,2025-04-06T07:59:44,2025-04-06T12:41:49,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/turkey-chp-imamoglu-protests-erdogan-e3aba84ca1d08baaa5b1c3952c2dfd12,"ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey’s main opposition party reelected its chairman Sunday, two weeks after the arrest of the mayor of Istanbul, the party’s highest profile rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Ozgur Ozel was reelected at an extraordinary congress of the Republican People’s Party, or CHP, which he called to prevent what he said was a plot by the government to appoint a caretaker for the party. The arrest of Istanbul’s opposition Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on corruption charges has ignited large-scale anti-government protests. Imamoglu had emerged as the main challenger to Erdogan’s 22-year rule since he was elected mayor of Istanbul in 2019, overturning a quarter-century of rule by parties from Turkey’s conservative Islamist tradition. The opposition claims the charges against Imamoglu are politically motivated, but the government insists the judiciary is independent and free of political interference. While in prison, Imamoglu was confirmed as the CHP’s presidential candidate for the election scheduled for 2028, but which will likely to take place earlier. Ozel said he decided to call Sunday’s party congress on March 21, two days after Imamoglu’s arrest and hours before the alleged government caretaker was to be appointed for CHP. “They didn’t have the courage to compete with us in service, so instead they attempted to intimidate our municipalities and the opposition by using the might of the government against their rivals,” Ozel told the assembly. “They thought they could remain in power by polarizing the public and provoking new conflicts.” Former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou and a delegation from the European Parliament’s Party of European Socialists visited the CHP headquarters Saturday to offer their support and solidarity with “all people fighting for democracy and the rule of law in Turkey.” Turkish media reported that Papandreou attended Sunday’s congress. Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, suffered a major setback during municipal elections last year, when the CHP retained control over key cities like Istanbul and Ankara while also making huge gains elsewhere. In the months since that election, many opposition mayors of both the CHP and the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, have been replaced by government-appointed caretakers on terrorism charges, which the parties strongly dispute.",Turkish opposition party reelects chairman following arrest of Istanbul mayor,,AP News,2025-04-06T15:06:30,2025-04-06T11:06:30,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/bolsonaro-brazil-coup-attempt-amnesty-law-trial-25975a7b422c7d0edff4436f7cafc9bb,"SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) — Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro led a rally Sunday in support of an amnesty law that could free him from criminal charges and eliminate the prison sentences of dozens of supporters who stormed the nation’s congress two years ago to protest the election of his successor, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has been charged by Brazilian prosecutors of trying to organize a coup following his defeat to Lula in the October 2022 election, with investigators saying he plotted with 33 others to poison Lula and kill a supreme court judge. In March, a panel of supreme court judges accepted the charges and launched a trial against Bolsonaro, where the former president will face five counts that include attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organization, and threatening the state’s assets and heritage sites. On Sunday, Bolsonaro dismissed the charges, which he claims are part of a political persecution against him. Speaking to thousands of supporters who gathered in one of Sao Paulo’s main avenues wearing yellow Brazil soccer jerseys, Bolsonaro said he had faith in the Brazilian people and hoped that Congress would approve an amnesty law drafted by his allies. “We have a way out of this,” Bolsonaro said. Bolsonaro, a conservative who has long expressed his admiration for President Donald Trump, said that Brazilian courts were trying to “hunt him” with “lawfare” just like courts in France recently went after far-right leader Marine Le Pen. The former president was barred from running for office until 2030 by Brazil’s electoral court, for making unfounded claims about the nation’s electoral system, that suggested voting machines had been rigged. Bolsonaro has said he will challenge that ruling and is planning to run for office in the 2026 presidential election. “To hold elections in 2026 without Jair Bolsonaro, is to negate democracy” Bolsonaro said during Sunday’s rally.",Brazil's Bolsonaro leads rally in support of amnesty law as he faces trial for alleged coup plot,,AP News,2025-04-06T16:35:12,2025-04-06T18:52:15,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/mali-algeria-sahel-alliance-drone-a42b34f060eb91edb28da49687cf8c5a,"BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — Relations between Algeria and the military alliance of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger plunged to historic lows Monday as the two sides curtailed diplomatic ties in a spat over a downed drone last week. Algeria says it shot down the Malian drone March 31 when it crossed into its air space near the border town of Tin Zaouatine. Mali denies the drone crossed the border, and the three-country bloc — the Alliance of Sahel States or AES — called the downing an “irresponsible act” that violated international law. The three countries pulled their ambassadors from Algeria late Sunday, and Algeria followed suit Monday by withdrawing its ambassadors from those countries. Algeria and Mali also announced they were barring each other’s planes from entering their airspace. Algeria denied any wrongdoing in the drone incident and accused Mali of trying to redirect blame for its internal problems. “The junta of putschists ruling in Mali is vainly attempting to make our country a scapegoat for the setbacks and woes of which the Malian people are paying the heaviest price,” Algeria’s foreign ministry said in a statement. Mali, which uses drones against rebels in the region, has said that Algeria’s actions proved that it “sponsored international terrorism.” The Malian government has pursued an aggressive campaign to combat rebels in its northern regions, where a mixture of Tuareg movements and transnational jihadi groups wield power. Amnesty International last year accused Mali’s army of using drones against civilians in incidents in which the government claimed they were targeting jihadist groups. Mali on Sunday said it had summoned the Algerian ambassador, withdrawn from a 15-year-old regional military group that includes Algeria, and planned to file a complaint with international bodies about the drone incident. The escalation comes after months of rising tensions between Algeria and its southern neighbors, including Mali. Since seizing control, the region’s juntas have reshaped the balance of power in northwest Africa. Military leaders in the three AES countries — Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso — left the Economic Community of West African States, the nearly 50-year-old regional bloc known as ECOWAS. They created their own security partnership, the Alliance of Sahel States, in September last year. Algeria has one of Africa’s largest militaries and has long considered itself a regional power. The military leaders of the three Sahel nations have recently distanced themselves from Algeria as they have championed autonomy and sought new alliances, including with Russia. Rida Lyammouri, a Sahel expert at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, said the latest war of words was unlikely to escalate beyond that. “Mali, and other AES members would not engage militarily against Algeria, and vice versa,” he said, noting Mali did not fully control its border areas. Algeria once served as a key mediator during more than a decade of conflict between Mali’s government and Tuareg rebels. But the two countries have grown apart since a military junta staged coups in 2020 and 2021, putting military personnel in charge of Mali’s key institutions. Algeria has denounced the direction that Mali’s new government has taken and its expanded efforts to quash rebellion in historically volatile parts of northern Mali. Afraid of the conflict spilling over the border, Algerian officials have denounced Mali’s use of Russian mercenaries and armed drones near Tin Zaouatine, a border town in the north were the drone was found. The Malian government did not recover the drone and videos seen on social media, posted by northern rebels, show them in possession of the remains of a Turkish made Akinci drone manufactured by Baykar downed in Tin Zaouatine. Mali purchased at least two from the Turkish company last year and has used them against armed separatists as well as fighters linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. __ Metz reported from Rabat, Morocco and McMakin from Dakar, Senegal.",Drone downing sparks diplomatic fallout between Algeria and Sahel countries,"Wilson Mcmakin, Baba Ahmed, Sam Metz",AP News,2025-04-06T19:36:38,2025-04-07T17:15:16,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/iran-rial-currency-us-7077a417560efcb6d9cbf7102cbc8b57,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran ’s rial currency traded Saturday at a record low against the U.S. dollar as the country returned to work after a long holiday, costing over 1 million rials for a single greenback as tensions between Tehran and Washington likely will push it even lower. The exchange rate had plunged to over 1 million rials during the Persian New Year, Nowruz, as currency shops closed and only informal trading took place on the streets, creating additional pressure on the market. But as traders resumed work Saturday, the rate fell even further to 1,043,000 to the dollar, signaling the new low appeared here to stay. On Ferdowsi Street in Iran’s capital, Tehran, the heart of the country’s money exchanges, some traders even switched off their electronic signs showing the going rate as uncertainty loomed over how much further the rial could drop. “We turn it off since we are not sure about the successive changes of the rate,” said Reza Sharifi, who works at one exchange. Iran’s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. At the time of the 2015 deal, which saw Iran drastically limit its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium in exchange for lifting of international sanctions, the rial traded at 32,000 to the dollar. After Trump returned to the White House for his second term in January, he restarted his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign targeting Tehran with sanctions. He again went after firms trading Iranian crude oil, including those selling at a discount in China. Trump meanwhile has written to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, trying to jumpstart direct talks between Tehran and Washington. So far, Iran has maintained it is willing for indirect talks, but such discussions under the Biden administration failed to make headway. Meanwhile, Trump is continuing an intense airstrike campaign targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the last force in Tehran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance” able to attack Israel after other militant groups were mauled by Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Mehdi Darabi, a market analyst, said he believed that foreign pressures in recent months caused “expectations for the possibility of a decrease in oil sales and more inflation, and it caused a higher rate for hard currencies,” according to Tehran’s Donay-e-Eqtesad economic newspaper. A pensioner who gave only his first name, Saeed, for fear of reprisals, said if Iran stopped its hostile policy toward the outside, financial relief could be possible. “If we want to live a comfortable life, we should maintain good ties with our neighbors,” he said. “We shouldn’t bare our teeth at them. They will do the same.” Economic upheavals have evaporated the public’s savings, pushing average Iranians into holding onto hard currencies, gold, cars and other tangible wealth. Others pursue cryptocurrencies or fall into get-rich-quick schemes. Meanwhile, internal political pressure remains inflamed still over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past. Iran’s theocracy has responded by dialing broadly back hijab enforcement and easing restrictions on at least one political figure. On Saturday, the state-run IRNA news agency even quoted a portions of a statement from Mehdi Karroubi, a Shiite cleric, parliament speaker and two-time presidential candidate who has been held in his home since the 2011 Arab Spring protests. Karroubi, who also was one of the leaders of Iran’s 2009 Green Movement protests, is in the process of being released from house arrest. “The end of my house arrest has coincided with a super-crisis that has ... put the country at the verge of devastating war,” his statement said. The falling rial has put more pressure as well on Iranian reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. In March, when the rate was 930,000 rials to the dollar, Iran’s parliament impeached his finance minister, Abdolnasser Hemmati over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement. Anger over government spending also saw Pezeshkian fire his vice president in charge of parliamentary affairs, Shahram Dabiri, for taking a luxury cruise to Antarctica, state media reported. Though Dabiri reportedly used his own money for the trip with his wife, the Instagram photos posted of his trip angered an Iranian public scrapping by to survive. “In a situation where the economic pressures on people are huge and the number of deprived people is massive, expensive recreational trip by officials even by their own personal fund is not defendable and reasonable,” Pezeshkian said in firing Dabiri, who so far hasn’t offered any public explanation for his trip. Pezeshkian separately said Saturday that Iran wanted a “dialogue from an equal position” with the U.S. “If you want negotiations, what is the point of threatening?” Pezeshkian asked, according to IRNA. “America today is not only humiliating Iran, but the world, and this behavior contradicts the call for negotiations.” ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.","Iran currency falls to record low of 1,043,000 rials to $1","Nasser Karimi, Jon Gambrell",AP News,2025-04-05T10:14:14,2025-04-05T13:14:11,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-mass-vatican-50973c32de3f6e2cc1fd9dc036968f70,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francismade a surprise entrance to St. Peter’s Square during a special Jubilee Mass for the sick and health workers on Sunday, marking his first public appearance at the Vatican sinceleaving the hospital two weeks ago after a life-threatening bout with pneumonia. The pontiff waved at the crowd of faithful that stood and applauded as he was pushed in a wheelchair unannounced to the front of the altar in the square. Some exclaimed, “I see the pope!’' as his image first emerged on a big screen showing him passing through the Holy Door before being brought down a ramp to the altar. “Good Sunday to everyone,’’ Francis said, speaking into a microphone, which he tapped to make sure it was working on a second attempt. “Thank you very much.” The pontiff’s voice sounded stronger than when he addressed well-wishers outside of Gemelli hospital on the day of his release March 23, after a five-week hospital stay. He wore nasal tubes to receive supplemental oxygen, which the Vatican says is being gradually reduced. As he waved and blessed the crowd, his arm movements remained limited — which his doctorsaid was not related to his illness but to an unspecified trauma suffered before his Feb. 14 hospitalization. After the Mass, the pontiff greeted some of those who assisted in the service, many who bowed to kiss his hands. He exited the square through the Holy Door. Francis has just completed two weeks of at least two months of doctor-ordered rest as he continues physical, respiratory and speech therapy, as well as treatment for a lingering lung infection. The pope referred to his experience with illness in both the traditional Sunday blessing and the homily read by Archbishop Rino Fisichella, organizer of the Holy Year that is expected to bring some 30 million pilgrims to Rome. Addressing the sick among the crowd, the pope said in the homily read by Fisichella that “In this moment of my life I share a lot: the experience of infirmity, feeling weak, depending on the others for many things, needing support. “It is not easy, but it is a school in which we learn every day to love and to let ourselves be loved, without demanding and without rejecting, without regretting, without despairing, grateful to God and to our brothers for the good that we receieve, trusting for what is still to come.’' He also urged the faithful not to push the fragile from their lives “as unfortunately a certain mentality does today. Let’s not ostracize pain from our surroundings. Let’s instead make it an opportunity to grow together, to cultivate hope.’' In the traditional Sunday blessing, he offered prayers for doctors, nurses and health care workers “who are not always helped to work in inadequate conditions, at times the victims of aggression. Their mission is not easy and must be supported and respected.’' The faithful were moved by the pope’s unexpected appearance. ‘’It was beautiful, something completely unexpected because I didn’t think I would see the pope,’' said Pasquale Citrolo from Trapani, Sicily. “Instead he gave us this gift.’' Linda Elezi, from the Adriatic coastal province of Ancona, said she was touched by the pope’s “surprise.’' “We pray for him every day, and he prays for us, and for peace and for all the wold, because that is the message of our pilgrimage today: Bring peace to all the world,’' she said. ____ Barry reported from Milan.",Pope appears before crowd in St. Peter’s Square,"Silvia Stellacci, Colleen Barry",AP News,2025-04-06T05:55:08,2025-04-06T11:43:07,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250406000700320?section=economy-finance/economy,"SEOUL, April 6 (Yonhap) -- The South Korean government plans to inject 3 trillion won (US$2 billion) in emergency aid into the local car industry to cushion the blow from new 25 percent U.S. tariffs, officials said Sunday. The new tariffs, enacted last week by U.S. President Donald Trump, are part of a broader protectionist push to reduce trade deficits and strengthen domestic manufacturing. South Korea is among the countries hit hardest, with its car exports to the United States accounting for nearly half of its total car sales overseas. At a ministerial meeting scheduled for this week, the government will approve the emergency financing plan, which will be carried out through state-run lenders, such as the Korea Development Bank (KDB). ""The financial support will likely amount to around 3 trillion won, though the exact figure hasn't been finalized,"" said an official from the Ministry of Economy and Finance. ""It will be disbursed through KDB's existing loan programs."" Cars are parked at a port in Pyeongtaek, some 65 kilometers south of Seoul, on April 3, 2025. (Yonhap) In addition, the KDB and other policy lenders will provide up to 248 trillion won this year in broader financial support to help businesses navigate worsening global conditions and restructure industrial sectors. The government has also confirmed plans to establish a 50 trillion-won strategic fund over the next five years to support the development of future mobility technologies in response to growing economic uncertainty following the start of Trump's second term. The Financial Services Commission will also meet with top executives from major commercial banks and state-run lenders on Monday, encouraging them to participate in the coordinated effort to support the struggling auto sector. Cars are South Korea's top export item to the United States. In 2024, auto exports to the U.S. reached $34.7 billion, accounting for nearly half of all South Korean vehicle exports. Analysts warn that the new tariffs will significantly impact the country's economy by driving up the prices of Korean cars in the U.S. market. A report published by the IBK Economic Research Institute estimated that South Korea's car exports to the U.S. will decrease by 18.6 percent once Washington imposes 25 percent tariffs on car imports. brk@yna.co.kr(END)",S.

https://apnews.com/article/syria-saudi-arabia-ahmad-alsharaa-trip-facf664205c3362de15e67b73527c92b,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Syria’s interim president made his first trip abroad Sunday, traveling to Saudi Arabia in a move likely trying to signal Damascus’ shift away from Iran as its main regional ally. Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, landed in Riyadh alongside his government’s foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani. The two men traveled on a Saudi jet, with a Saudi flag visible on the table behind them. Saudi state television trumpeted the fact that al-Sharaa, first known internationally by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, made Riyadh his first destination. Syria’s new three-star, tricolor flag flew next to Saudi Arabia’s own at the airport as al-Sharaa in a suit and tie walked off the plane. He later met with a smiling Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, at al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. The state-run Saudi Press Agency described their discussions as examining ways to “support the security and stability of sisterly Syria.” Syria’s state-run SANA news agency quoted al-Sharaa as saying they “worked on raising the level of communication and cooperation in all areas, especially those humanitarian and economic.” Saudi Arabia had been among the Arab nations that poured money into insurgent groups that tried to topple President Bashar Assad after Syria’s 2011 Arab Spring protests turned into a bloody crackdown. However, its groups found themselves beaten back as Assad, supported by Iran and Russia, fought the war into a stalemate in Syria. That changed with the December lightning offensive led by al-Sharaa’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The group was once affiliated with al-Qaida but has since denounced its former ties. Al-Sharaa and HTS have carefully managed their public image in the time since, with the interim president favoring an olive-colored military look similar to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appointing women to roles and trying to maintain ties to Syria’s Christian and Shiite Alawite populations. That also includes keeping both Iran and Russia largely at arms’ length as well. Iran has yet to reopen its embassy in Damascus, which had been a key node in running operations through its self-described “Axis of Resistance,” including Assad’s Syria, Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia and other partners. Iranian state media noted the trip to Saudi Arabia, a longtime regional rival with which it struck a Chinese-mediated détente in 2023, without acknowledging its own challenges in Syria. Russia, meanwhile, would like to maintain access to air and sea bases it has in Syria, but took in Assad when he fled Syria during the advance. Those moves appear aimed at reassuring the West and trying to get crippling sanctions lifted on Syria. Rebuilding the country after over a decade of war will likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars, not to mention the cost of covering the needs of Syria’s people, millions of whom remain impoverished. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan visited Damascus in January and said Riyadh has been “actively engaging in dialogue” to lift sanctions on Syria. Saudi Arabia, unlike Al-Sharaa’s key allies in Turkey and Qatar, restored ties with Assad in 2023 alongside most of the Arab world. Getting sanctions lifted could go a long way in cementing their relationship. Before al-Sharaa’s trip, he hosted Qatar’s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, in Damascus as his first foreign head of state. Meanwhile, Syria’s interim government still faces challenges from the Islamic State group and other militants in the country. On Saturday, a car bomb exploded in Manbij, a city in Syria’s Aleppo governorate, killing four civilians and wounding nine, SANA reported, citing civil defense officials. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels had seized Manbij in December, part of a push by Ankara to secure Syrian territory close to its border for a buffer zone. —— Associated Press writer Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed to this report.",Syria's interim president visits Saudi Arabia on first trip,Jon Gambrell,AP News,2025-02-02T08:14:23,2025-02-02T08:30:46,gemini-2.0-flash

Tusk announced on the X platform that his Civic Platform party’s computer system was targeted. “Foreign interference in elections begins. Services point to eastern trace,” Tusk said. Jan Grabiec, the head of Tusk’s office, told the Polish state news agency PAP that the cyberattack consisted of an attempt to take control of computers of employees of the Civic Platform office and the election staff over about a dozen hours on Wednesday. Asked if Tusk was pointing the finger at Russia or Belarus, Grabiec said that would be for Poland’s secret services to comment on, but that in past cases Belarusians have infiltrated Poland’s systems on behalf of Russian intelligence services. Poland is weeks away from the first round of a presidential election, scheduled for May 18. The frontrunner is the Civic Platform candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, who like Tusk is a pro-European Union centrist. He has been polling around 35%.

The document was intercepted by Israeli soldiers during the invasion of Gaza and forwarded to the IDF intelligence Catalogue unit, which analyzes intercepted foreign intelligence items. According to Katz, the document and communications show that Hamas requested $500 million from the Islamic Republic ""to destroy Israel"", sometime before or leading up to the October 7 invasion. Further, the defense minister said that the head of Palestinian Affairs for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, known as ""Izadi,"" approved the request made by now-deceased Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif. Katz said that Izadi said he would approve the terror financing assistance despite Tehran being under financial strain and sanctions because of the supreme importance of embracing conflict against Israel and the US. He added that the world must realize that Iran is ""the head of the snake"" which has directed the malign activities of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and terror groups in Syria and Iraq. Despite the revelation, Israeli intelligence has said Iran did not know the exact timing or plans of the October 7 invasion, but rather has focused on the idea that Hamas could not have pulled off the invasion without IRGC training, weapons, and funding.

Israel last monthended its ceasefirewith Hamas and hasseized territoryto pressure the militant group to accept a new deal for a truce and release of remaining hostages. It has blocked the import offood, fuel and other suppliesfor over a month to the coastal territory heavily reliant on outside assistance. Israel’s military late Sunday ordered Palestinians to evacuate several neighborhoods in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah shortly after about 10 projectiles were fired from Gaza 	 the largest barrage from the territory since Israel resumed the war. The military said about five were intercepted. Hamas’ military arm claimed responsibility. Police said a rocket fell in Ashkelon city and fragments fell in several other areas. The Magen David Adom emergency service said one man was lightly injured. The military later said it struck a rocket launcher in Gaza. Israeli strikes overnight into Sunday hit a tent and a house in the southern city of Khan Younis, killing five men, five women and five children, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. The body of a toddler took up one end of an emergency stretcher. A female journalist was among the dead. “My daughter is innocent. She had no involvement, she loved journalism and adored it,” said her mother, Amal Kaskeen. “Trump wants to end the Gaza issue. He is in a hurry, and that is clear from this morning,” said Mohammad Abdel-Hadi, cousin of a woman killed. Israeli shelling killed at least four people in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The bodies of seven people, including a child and three women, arrived at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, according to an Associated Press journalist there. And a strike in Gaza City hit people waiting outside a bakery and killed at least six, including three children, according to the civil defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government. Dozens of Palestinians took to the streets in Jabaliya for new anti-war protests. Footage on social media showed people marching and chanting against Hamas. Such protests, while rare, have occurred in recent weeks. There is also anger inside Israel over the war’s resumption and its effects on remaining hostages in Gaza. Families of hostages along with some of those recently freed from Gaza and their supporters have urged Trump to help ensure the fighting ends. Netanyahu on Monday will meet with Trump for the second time since Trump began his latest term in January. The prime minister said they would discuss the war and the new 17%tariff imposedon Israel, part of a sweeping global decision by the U.S. “There is a very large queue of leaders who want to do this with respect to their economies. I think it reflects the special personal connection and the special connection between the United States and Israel, which is so vital at this time,” Netanyahu said while wrapping up a visit to Hungary. The U.S., a mediator in ceasefire efforts along with Egypt and Qatar, had expressed support for Israel’s resumption of the war last month. Hundreds of Palestinians since then have been killed, among them 15 medics whose bodies were recovered only a week later. Israel’s military this weekendbacktracked on its accountof what happened in the incident, captured in part on video, that angered Red Cross and Red Crescent and U.N. officials. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Fifty-nine hostages are still held in Gaza 	 24 believed to be alive. Israel’s offensive has killed at least 50,695 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says more than half were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. Early Monday, strikes hit inside the compound of Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where an Associated Press camera caught the sound of the explosions. Smoke and fire were seen from distance, and there were no immediate reports of casualties. The Palestinian Health Ministry in the occupied West Bank said one Palestinian-American teen was killed and two others were injured 	 one in critical condition 	 and asserted that Israeli settlers had shot them. Israel’s military said it was looking into the incident in Turmus Ayya town, which is near Jerusalem and has a large population of Palestinian-Americans. The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with Israel’s military carrying out military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians anddisplaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis. ___ Associated Press writer Natalie Melzer in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at","Israeli strikes on Gaza kill at least 32 people, mostly women and children",,AP News,2025-04-06T11:20:13,2025-04-06T21:45:14,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/turkey-crackdown-opposition-protest-dissent-imamoglu-politics-6f641b9b90c8b9500d411578443d2768,"ISTANBUL (AP) — The arrest of an opposition presidential candidate last month has triggered Turkey’s largest anti-government protests in more than a decade, uniting demonstrators from different walks of life and sometimes diametrically opposed political views. It includes supporters of popular Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, and young people who see all politicians as ineffective. Protesters range from the socialist left to the ultra-nationalist right, and from university students to retirees. They are united by a sense that the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has grown increasingly authoritarian, diminishing the secular and democratic values and laws that the country was built upon. They are fueled by outrage at Imamoglu’s arrest and the government’s attempts to quell the ensuing protests. Protests began after opposition leader was arrested The protests began after the government arrested Imamoglu, the man seen as posing the most serious electoral challenge to Erdogan in years, on March 19. Prosecutors accuse him of corruption and aiding an outlawed Kurdish organization. Critics say the charges are an excuse to get a key rival out of the way, but the government denies interfering with the legal process. The largest protests have happened alongside rallies of Imamoglu’s center-left pro-secularist Republican People’s Party, known as the CHP, but many young protesters said they don’t support the party. Ogulcan Akti, a 26-year-old university student working two part-time jobs to support his family, said both the opposition and the ruling party are “liars.” “The ones in power and the opposition that will come later, they’re all the same,” he said. “We don’t trust anyone.” Students led the charge In the days after the mayor’s arrest, thousands of students converged near Istanbul city hall. Some waved Turkish flags; others held images of left-wing figures from the 1970s and sang a Turkish version of the Italian protest song “Bella ciao.” In images on social media, some protesters made the ultranationalist “grey wolf” hand sign, standing next to others showing the leftists’ raised fist. Some showed the peace sign favored by both leftists and pro-Kurdish groups, while others chanted slogans attacking the banned militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party. Berk Esen, an associate professor of political science at Sabanci University, said most protesters he has seen are educated, urban young people aged 18 to 25, but they have little else in common: “This is a much more amorphous, eclectic group politically,” he said. Anger spurs unrest One afternoon last week, dozens of students from Bogazici University gathered at a metro station in Istanbul, many wearing masks to avoid reprisals or arrest. More than 2,000 people, including journalists, have been detained since the protests began. Around 300 were formally arrested on charges including “joining an illegal protest” and “resisting the police,” with some accused of “terrorism links.” Lawyers for the arrested students say that the charge of “joining an illegal protest” does not justify extended detention, and that the number of arrests is “unusually high” compared to offenses such as terrorism or drugs.  At the metro station, 22-year-old management student Burak Turan and his girlfriend slipped into a mall, watching officers detain dozens of protesters. “We are here because so many students are getting arrested for no reason,” Turan said. “They act like it’s a war; they are exercising wartime laws.” Turan refused to wear a mask, saying he had nothing to be ashamed of. Other protesters include public employees, artists and retirees, many of whom support the CHP. A man in his 60s watching a standoff at city hall said he was there to defend the rights of the younger generation. “We don’t matter, they do. They are our future.” he said. Others were there to speak out against as what they perceived as a slide away from Turkey’s secular and democratic values under Erdogan. Mehtap Bozkurt, a 70-year-old pensioner and a CHP supporter, joined a protest outside Istanbul city hall. “This country is secular and will remain secular,” she said. “We will resist until the end. I am ready to give my life and blood for this issue.” That doesn’t mean that people protesting aren’t practicing Muslims, said Esen, the Sabanci academic. “There are Muslims, religious people and those who at least perform some religious duties amongst the protesters,” he said. “But they also probably define themselves as secular.” Parents protest treatment of students Outside the courts in Istanbul, parents and relatives, some holding flowers, maintained an anxious vigil. Some hoped for a loved one’s immediate release, while others were overcome with frustration. One family member, who asked to remain anonymous fearing reprisals from officials, told local media that the detained students had “studied day and night to get into the best universities.” “Look at the treatment they are receiving now. There are no rights. There is no law. There is no justice,” she said. Another woman showed journalists a picture of her son with a black eye. “He told me, ‘Mom, they beat me up,’” she said tearfully. Another woman said she was a cancer patient left waiting since dawn. “What did these kids do? Did they murder someone? What did they even do?” Around 300 protesters spent the Eid holiday in prison, separated from their families.  Lawyers for several protesters told The Associated Press that students are held in overcrowded cells and face physical and verbal mistreatment, as well as limited access to meals since prison commissaries are closed for Eid. Lawyers also fear that students could miss exams or be expelled as a “punishment” for taking part in the protests. On Thursday the police issued a statement describing as “vile slander” claims that women had been sexually assaulted in custody.  The Interior Ministry said that at least 150 police officers were injured in clashes with demonstrators. Images from the protests showed riot police using tear gas and plastic pellets, while students threw plastic water bottles and flares. A pivotal moment Esen says the protests may mark a pivotal moment for Turkey. “Will the police violence used by the government against them make them throw in the towel after a certain point or will it bring about a bigger showdown and make this a long-term affair? If the latter happens, I will be very optimistic about Turkey becoming democratic again. If the former happens, all of this is heading toward a very bad place,” he said.  A young female protester wearing a mask watched the standoff with police unfolding near city hall last week. “I am here today because I do not accept autocracy,” she said. “Ekrem Imamoglu’s arrest means that we accept that there will be no more elections in this country. I do not accept this.”","Facing a government crackdown on dissent, Turkey's protesters put aside their differences",Robert Badendieck,AP News,2025-04-06T05:02:00,2025-04-06T01:02:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/04/06/2003834692,"The Han Kuang exercises, Taiwan’s largest annual military drills, began yesterday, with experts saying that the extended 14 days of war games were in response to China’s increasing “gray zone” activities and its potential to carry out a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. This year’s exercises started with around-the-clock computer-aided war games, using the US-built Joint Theater Level Simulation platform. The live-fire component of the exercises is to be held from July 9 to 18. The drills are to create scenarios in which Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) military exercises escalate into an attack on Taiwan, said Major General Tung Chi-hsing (董冀星), director of the Ministry of National Defense’s joint operations planning division. The Han Kuang exercises would also simulate PLA “gray zone” activities, which are provocative or aggressive actions that fall just short of an open conflict, Tung told a news conference on Wednesday. Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Ting-yu (王定宇) on Friday said that the public used to think that a first strike by China would likely come in the form of a missile attack. However, it is more realistic to think that a first strike would involve maritime militia vessels, sand dredgers and drones, which are commonly used in “gray zone” operations, he said. Wang, a member of the legislature’s Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, said the military has to consider how to deal with situations that go beyond traditional force-on-force confrontations. These include how to respond to “gray zone” activities within the bounds of international law, while preventing Chinese military drills from escalating into a full-scale invasion, he said. Such complex scenarios require detailed planning and simulation, making the war games more time-consuming, he said. Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), director of the Division of Defense Strategy and Resources at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, expressed similar views, saying that the Han Kuang drills were likely extended this year from eight days to two weeks to facilitate more scenarios involving “gray zone” tactics. When the PLA is conducting its naval and air patrols around Taiwan, it usually deploys six to 10 warships, Su said, adding that if each of them were equipped with vertical launching systems, there could be about 500 land-attack cruise missiles ready to strike targets across Taiwan within three minutes. That would leave defense forces with even less response time than if Dongfeng (East Wind, 東風) missiles were launched across the Taiwan Strait from China, he said. That makes simulating such scenarios critically important, particularly as PLA drills near Taiwan have become more frequent in the past few years, he added. Minister of National Defense Minister Wellington Koo (顧立雄) in a recent legislative hearing said this year’s Han Kuang exercises would be based on a hypothetical invasion by the PLA in 2027, Su said. That year would mark several milestones in China, such as the 100th anniversary of the PLA’s founding, the start of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s (習近平) fourth term in office and the 12th year of Xi’s military reforms, he said. This year’s exercises would test how the Ministry of National Defense would respond in the event of a 2027 invasion and assess any shortcomings in the armed forces’ readiness and arsenal of weapons, Su said.",Han Kuang drills to target China’s ‘gray zone’ tactics,"Staff writer, with CNA",Taipei Times,2025-04-06T00:00:00,2025-04-05T23:40:13,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250404010251320?section=economy-finance/economy,"SEOUL, April 4 (Yonhap) -- The government will hold a series of emergency meetings with representatives from major South Korean industries expected to suffer damage from the United States' hefty tariffs, the industry ministry said Friday. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy held a meeting with officials from the home appliances, display and machinery industries earlier in the day and plans to hold a separate meeting with those from the rechargeable battery, petrochemical and textiles industries on Monday, according to ministry officials. In Friday's meeting, the home appliances, display and machinery companies called for active support measures by the government to minimize U.S. duties' impact on local businesses, including export vouchers and emergency cash injections. The companies expressed concerns over a potential drop in their exports to America and increased competition in overseas markets other than the U.S., according to the ministry. Lee Seung-ryeol (R), deputy minister for industry policy, holds a meeting with officials from the home appliances, display and machinery industries to discuss the response strategy to U.S. reciprocal tariffs in Seoul on April 4, 2025, in this photo provided by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. (PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans to impose 10 percent baseline tariffs on imports from all foreign countries, as well as ""reciprocal"" tariffs, including 25 percent duties for South Korea, sparking fears of a global trade war. The baseline and reciprocal tariffs will go into effect on Saturday and Wednesday (U.S. time), respectively. ""The ministry will work to minimize the damage on local companies by closely assessing the effects of reciprocal tariffs in each sector, and use all of the government's available resources to boost the fundamental competitiveness of our industries,"" said Lee Seung-ryeol, deputy minister for industry policy at the ministry. Separately, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun held a high-level officials' meeting after the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law decree in December. Ahn asked officials, including Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo, to tighten discipline among civil servants following the court's ruling. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) Gov't to hold relay emergency meetings with major industries under influence of U.S. tariffs,Choi Kyong-ae,Yonhap News Agency,2025-04-04T18:55:42,2025-04-04T18:55:42,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.ilmessaggero.it/en/pope_francis_uncertain_path_to_recovery-8761087.html?refresh_ce,"VATICAN CITY Uncertainty, caution, disorientation. At Santa Marta, they are truly navigating by sight. The pleasant ""surprise"" that Pope Francis wanted to offer for tomorrow's Angelus at noon, showing himself in front of the cameras for a few minutes—from inside Santa Marta—will have to wait for a more favorable time. When will that be? Who knows. In the Vatican, they shrug their shoulders despondently. From the airtight isolation on the second floor of the Domus where Bergoglio lives, hardly anything emerges, though many, knowing the stubbornness and unpredictability of this pontiff, do not even exclude that tomorrow morning, perhaps feeling a bit better than today, he might try again to record the brief message of thanks that he declined. This afternoon, Vatican technicians arrived at Santa Marta with all the equipment, awaiting instructions. They waited a bit and were eventually sent back. Francis didn't feel up to it. Nothing particularly concerning, and perhaps it's even normal for a patient with such a clinical picture to have moments of reconsideration, weakness, or temporary apathy, followed by alternating better phases. Yesterday, the Vatican staff had announced that Sunday's appointment would finally be different and would break the heavy media silence that has been ongoing for months. Naturally, no particular details were added, although it was clear that the Pope could now perfectly record a short video to circulate at noon. A second hypothesis was even seriously considered, that he might appear live in front of the cameras for a few minutes, just enough time to bless and thank the faithful worldwide for the devotion shown during his illness. Tomorrow, the Angelus for the eighth consecutive Sunday should only be in written form. It is also expected that at the end of the Mass in St. Peter's Square for the Jubilee of the Sick, Monsignor Rino Fisichella will read a brief papal message to the faithful. Bergoglio wants to express gratitude to millions of people who send a thought, a prayer, a message, a letter, or a drawing to the Vatican every day. Since the health risks for the pontiff are still quite high at this stage of convalescence, every decision is evaluated by the attending physicians and healthcare workers who, in agreement with the illustrious patient, help orient towards the best solution. The ""protected convalescence"" path—as it was called by the hospital team—requires several weeks of care and caution, and the slightest misstep can be dangerous, even excessive strain on the vocal cords already stressed during the long hospital stay for high-flow oxygen administration. Any uncalculated risk can turn back the clock. Consequently, everything is measured with common sense. Probably, Pope Francis is chomping at the bit; the isolation period is heavy, and he desires to soon resume some activities, for example, communicating with people again as he did before, even through indirect communication methods. In the Vatican, they assure that the improvements towards recovery are real, visible, and noticeable daily, thanks to motor and respiratory therapies, but bilateral pneumonia is not yet healed, the foci persist, and antibiotic treatments are still ongoing. To date, it's difficult to imagine if and when Pope Francis will be able to do the same things as before, such as intense and tiring trips, long celebrations, or the deadly concentration of daily appointments on the agenda. For this month, the meeting of the Council of Cardinals (the fifty-first) has been canceled: it was announced at the beginning of last December for April 2025 and would have been used to discuss the Synod and synodality. Meanwhile, Pope Francis from the Gemelli Polyclinic last month arranged that in 2028 he wants to convene a worldwide Ecclesial Assembly instead of the ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops. An attentive observer like Luis Badilla, former director of the para-Vatican site Sismografo, wonders if ""four months ago there was or wasn't this project? Or was it only thought of in these last three months? Above all, I wonder why the communication was made while the Pope was hospitalized and, finally, why nothing was anticipated to the members of the Council of Cardinals?""",Pope Francis' Uncertain Path to Recovery,Franca Giansoldati,Il Messaggero,2025-04-05T13:10:15,2025-04-06T16:30:28,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/south-midwest-flash-flooding-rain-tornadoes-db92213177e3b36016e0b56044e6570d,"DYERSBURG, Tennessee. (AP) 	
— Another round of torrential rain and flash floodingcame Saturday for parts of the South and Midwestalready heavily waterloggedby days of severe storms that also spawned deadly tornadoes. Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days. Overnight into Sunday morning there were new tornado warnings issued in Alabama and Mississippi, along with flash flood warnings in several counties in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. Day after day of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies in from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach what the agency calls “major flood stage,”with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible. At least 16 weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee. A 57-year-old man died Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky including a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said. Also Saturday, a 5-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided. Tornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighborhoods and were responsible for at least seven of the deaths. There were 521 flights cancelled and more than 6,400 flights delayed within the U.S. or coming into or leaving the country on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday. Interstate commerce also could be affected. The extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather. The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast officeshave 20% vacancy ratesafter Trump administrationjob cuts, twice that of just a decade ago. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday that the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days. “We expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,” he said. Flash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning. Hundreds of Kentucky roads across the state were impassable because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides. Downtown Hopkinsville, Kentucky, reopened in the morning after floodwaters from the Little River receded, giving a much-needed reprieve, but still more rainfall was on its way, Mayor James R. Knight Jr. said. “We got a little rain, but most of it went north of us,” Knight said. “Thank goodness on that. Gave us a little break.” In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed. In Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary due to widespread flooding. BNSF Railway confirmed that a railroad bridge in Mammoth Spring was washed out by floodwaters, causing the derailment of several cars. No injuries were reported, but there was no immediate estimate for when the bridge would reopen. Since Wednesday, more than a foot of rain (30.5 centimeters) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday. Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state’s emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding. In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities. Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage. “I grabbed all my stuff and came here,” said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: “I don’t leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed. I have to make sure I have them with me.” Schreiner reported from Shelbyville, Kentucky.

https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-hamas-war-security-corridor-f30c4514ea5635f7b32112b0acdf5905,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli troops deployed to a newly established security corridor across southern Gaza, the military announced Saturday, as pressure on the Hamas militant group increased weeks into the renewed war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday announced the new Morag Corridor and suggested it would cut off the southern city of Rafah, which Israel had ordered evacuated, from the rest of Gaza. A military statement said troops with the 36th Division had been deployed. It was not immediately clear how many, or where exactly the new corridor was located. Morag is the name of a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, and Netanyahu had suggested it would run between the cities. Maps published by Israeli media showed the corridor running the width of the narrow coastal strip from east to west. Netanyahu had said it would be “a second Philadelphi corridor,” referring to the Gaza side of the border with Egypt farther south, which has been under Israeli control since last May. Last month, Israel shattered a ceasefire in Gaza with a surprise bombardment after trying to pressure Hamas to accept proposed new terms for the truce that had taken hold in January. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed. Israel quickly reasserted control over the Netzarim corridor that cuts off the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, from the rest of the strip. The Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors run from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea. “We are cutting up the strip, and we are increasing the pressure step by step, so that they will give us our hostages,” Netanyahu said Wednesday. His defense minister has said Israel would seize large areas of Gaza and add them to its so-called security zones. Saturday’s announcement came shortly after a White House official confirmed that Netanyahu on Monday would again meet with President Donald Trump, their second meeting at the White House since Trump took office in January. The U.S. has been a mediator in ceasefire talks, along with Egypt and Qatar, but also supported Israel’s resumption of fighting. Following his previous meeting with Netanyahu, Trump made the surprise proposal that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the territory and he suggested that the United States take “ownership” in redeveloping the area. Palestinians, Arab nations and rights groups sharply criticized the idea. Israel has pledged to escalate the fighting with Hamas until the militant group returns the remaining hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war, disarms and leaves the territory. Israel last month again halted all supplies of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza in another application of pressure on the militant group and the territory’s over 2 million Palestinians. Rights groups say the tactic is a war crime. Gaza relies largely on humanitarian aid, and its residents cannot easily leave. Hamas says it will only release the remaining 59 hostages — 24 believed to be alive — in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory. The Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Some 251 hostages were taken, most of them released in ceasefire agreements and other deals. More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s offensive, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It doesn’t say whether they are civilians or combatants but says the majority have been women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. Among Gaza’s dead are 15 Palestinian medics killed last month by Israeli forces, who then bulldozed over the bodies along with their mangled vehicles, burying them in a mass grave. The war is the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas. It has left much of Gaza devastated and most of its residents displaced, often multiple times. Families of hostages at their weekly rally again pleaded for a ceasefire deal to bring everyone home from Gaza, alive or dead. “Netanyahu is working hard to ensure our hostages die, rather than working hard to save their lives,” said Efrat Machikawa, niece of hostage Gadi Moses. ___ Associated Press writer Fatima Hussein in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at ",Israel deploys troops to establish Morag Corridor across southern Gaza,Natalie Melzer,AP News,2025-04-05T12:12:04,2025-04-05T15:50:36,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/britain-carmakers-jlr-pause-ad5d4cfdca70975ab357e2cb5a8d698c,"LONDON (AP) — The maker of Jaguar and Land Rover cars is pausing shipments to the U.S. as Britain’s struggling auto industry begins to respond to the 25% tax on vehicle imports imposed by President Donald Trump. Jaguar Land Rover Automotive, one of Britain’s biggest carmakers, said Saturday that the pause would take place this month. “The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands,” the company said in a statement. “As we work to address the new trading terms with out business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.” Analysts said they expect other British carmakers to follow suit as the increased tariffs heap more pressure on an industry that is already struggling with declining demand at home and the need to retool their plants for the transition to electric vehicles. Related Stories “I expect similar stoppages from other producers as firms take stock of what is unfolding,” said David Bailey, an automotive industry expert and professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham. The number of cars made in the U.K. dropped 13.9% to 779,584 vehicles last year, according to the SMMT. More than 77% of those vehicles were destined for the export market. U.K. factories export cars such as Nissan’s Qashqai and Juke, BMW Mini, and Toyota Corolla, as well as Land Rover and Jaguar models. New cars are parked at Royal Portbury Docks, North Somerset, England, Friday April 4, 2025. (Ben Birchall via AP) “The industry is already facing multiple headwinds and this announcement comes at the worst possible time,” Mike Hawes, chief executive of the U.K.’s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said last week. “SMMT is in constant contact with government and will be looking for trade discussions to accelerate as we need to secure a way forward that supports jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.” U.K. carmakers have already taken steps to lessen the immediate impact of the tariffs by building stockpiles in the U.S. before the increase took effect. SMMT figures show that exports to the U.S. jumped 38.5% from a year earlier in December, 12.4% in January and 34.6% in February. “This was manufacturers like JLR trying to get ahead of the game in terms of getting inventory to the U.S. before the tariffs were implemented,’' Bailey said. British carmakers shipped 8.3 billion pounds ($10.7 billion) worth of vehicles to the U.S. in the 12 months through September, making cars the single biggest goods export to the U.S., according to government statistics. But cars make up a relatively small part of overall trade between Britain and the U.S., which is heavily weighted toward services. Britain exported 179.4 billion pounds ($231.2 billion) of goods and services to the U.S. in the year through September, with services making up 68.2% of that figure.",Jaguar and Land Rover maker pauses shipments to US as Trump's tariffs hit,Danica Kirka,AP News,2025-04-05T09:21:51,2025-04-06T04:20:11,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-india-china-modi-b0344b78d8e5c680567b5e057664a2d8,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated construction work on a solar plant in neighboring Sri Lanka and witnessed the signing of energy and defense agreements seen as efforts to consolidate New Delhi’s influence in the debt-stricken island nation. India has been concerned about China’s increasing presence in Sri Lanka, which is located on one of the world’s busiest shipping routes in what India considers part of its strategic backyard. Beijing has provided Sri Lanka with billions of dollars in loans for development projects. But Sri Lanka’s economic collapse in 2022 changed the country’s priorities and provided an opportunity for India, as New Delhi stepped in with massive financial and material assistance. At the same time, China’s support for restructuring its infrastructure loans is vital for Sri Lanka. Modi on Saturday held talks with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the two virtually inaugurated construction work on an Indian-funded 120-megawatt solar power plant, which is being built as a joint venture between the two countries. Sri Lanka faced a severe power shortage in 2022 after being unable to pay for oil and coal to power its electricity plants. It has also set ambitious goals of reducing its dependence on fossil fuel. Modi welcomed the agreements on defense cooperation and said both sides agreed to work together on security cooperation in the Indian Ocean through a regional grouping called the Colombo Security Conclave, which also includes Bangladesh, Maldives and Mauritius. “I am grateful to President Dissanayake for his sensitivity towards India’s interests. We believe that we have shared security interests. The security of both countries is interconnected and co-dependent,” Modi said. He said India has a special place for Sri Lanka in its “Neighbourhood First Policy” and has fulfilled its duties as a truly friendly neighbour when Sri Lanka was in difficulty. Modi was awarded “Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana,” the highest award presented to a foreign leader. Dissanayake said that he reiterated during talks with Modi that Sri Lanka’s territory will not be used for any acts that could harm India’s security and as well as the stability of the region. China plans to build a $3.7 billion oil refinery near Hambantota port, which was taken over by Beijing after Sri Lanka failed to pay back the loan to develop the port. It gives China a key foothold in the country directly opposite India’s coastline. Both India and China have separately agreed on terms with Sri Lanka for restructuring its debt, which would enable the country to come out from bankruptcy and rebuild the tattered economy. While the agreements were being signed, hundreds of protesters gathered opposite the capital Colombo’s main rail station, claiming the agreements were a betrayal of the country to Indian domination. Frontline Socialist Party, a radical splinter party of Dissanayake’s People’s Liberation Front, accused the president of backing down from his original stand on India. The leader of the party, Kumar Gunaratnam, said India had never been a genuine friend of Sri Lanka. Dissanayake’s party took up arms against a 1987 peace agreement between India and Sri Lanka but has since moderated its policy on its giant neighbor. India, which has its own sizable Tamil population, intervened in 1987 and signed an agreement with Sri Lanka to resolve Sri Lanka’s civil conflict. Some Tamil armed groups accepted the deal, the Tamil Tigers, the largest group, rejected it and continued to fight for separation. Government troops crushed the Tamil Tigers in 2009, and since then the government has faced international pressure to resolve the power-sharing issue through talks. —— Associated Press photographer Eranga Jayawardena contributed to this report.",India and Sri Lanka sign defense and energy deals as Modi's visit strengthens ties,Bharatha Mallawarachi,AP News,2025-04-05T05:52:08,2025-04-05T08:11:15,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-set-to-meet-trump-in-washington-on-monday-in-bid-to-reverse-tariffs/,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to visit the White House on Monday to discuss sweeping recently announced tariffs with US President Donald Trump, Israeli officials and a White House official said on Saturday. Netanyahu on Saturday night confirmed the visit, and his office said the two would also discuss “efforts to reach a hostage deal, Israel-Turkey relations, the Iranian threat, and confronting the International Criminal Court.” It will be Netanyahu’s fourth trip to Washington since the war in Gaza began and his second since Trump took office in January. The visit will also make Netanyahu the first foreign leader to negotiate in person with Trump over the US president’s sweeping new tariff policy, which included a 17% tariff on Israeli goods. “The prime minister appreciates the personal and warm relationship with President Trump,” said the statement from the premier’s office, “and thanks him for inviting him to be the first leader to meet with him after the imposition of global tariffs, just as he was also the first leader to meet with him after entering the White House.” Netanyahu will likely fly back to Israel from Washington on Tuesday morning. The surprise invite by Trump came in a phone call on Thursday with Netanyahu, who is presently on a visit to Hungary, when the Israeli leader raised the tariff issue, according to the Israeli officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The judges in Netanyahu’s ongoing criminal trial agreed to cancel Monday’s hearing so that he could fly to the US, but refused his lawyer’s request to cancel Wednesday’s hearing. A report on Saturday night said Israel fears that the US is “losing interest” in the hostage issue. Channel 12 said Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will be in Washington for the Netanyahu visit, and the Israeli hope is that negotiations can be revived. Backed by Witkoff, Israel has sought to secure an extended first phase of the deal signed in January under which more living hostages would be released, rather than entering the second phase of the deal, under which Israel would be obligated to end the war. In Budapest on Friday, a “senior official” on Netanyahu’s visit said it would be impossible to restart the war once Israel committed to ending it since Hamas would seek irrevocable guarantees, including a UN Security Council resolution. As regards Iran, the report said Israel is anxious to ensure that, with Trump declaring a readiness to negotiate a new deal designed to prevent Iran from attaining nuclear weapons, Israel’s essential interests would be taken into account. If there is no new negotiation, and with the US sending forces to the region, then Israel needs to coordinate with the US on a potential attack, the report said. Meanwhile, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on Friday that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken with Netanyahu “to underscore US support for Israel.” They discussed “the situation in Gaza and the Administration’s resolve to free the hostages in Gaza and recently announced tariffs,” Bruce said. Trump had also spoken with representatives from Israel, India and Vietnam to negotiate trade deals that could alleviate the proposed tariffs on those countries before the levies take effect next week, CNN reported Friday, citing a senior adviser. Netanyahu’s office did not comment on the call with Rubio or reported trade talks. Trump had told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday that Netanyahu “may very well be coming next week.” The US president also said he wants to “solve the Gaza problem” and hold direct talks with Iran over its nuclear program — even though Netanyahu thinks a new US-Iran nuclear deal is extremely unlikely and wants to discuss a potential strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, according to a senior Israeli official cited by Axios. According to the news site, Trump’s comment that Netanyahu could visit “next week” surprised Netanyahu and his office, as well as members of the US president’s own staff. Trump hadspokenhours earlier with Netanyahu and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, while Netanyahu was visiting Budapest. According to Netanyahu’s office, the conversation focused on Hungary’s withdrawal from the International Criminal Court and “the next steps that can be taken on this topic,” following the arrest warrants issued by the ICC in November against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza. During the call, Axios reported, Netanyahu brought up the new US tariffs, and Trump suggested the premier come to the White House to discuss them. A senior Israeli official had told reporters in Budapest on Friday that Netanyahu discussed the tariffs with Trump.Â	Â“I believe we will enter a dialogue with them, said the official. “In the end, most of it is solvable.” Trump’s 17% tariff on unspecified Israeli goods caught Jerusalem off guard. Earlier in the week, in a bid to forestall such a harsh penalty by Israel’s single largest trade partner, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich had scrapped all remaining tariffs on American imports. Netanyahu’s previous trip — the first by a foreign leader since Trump’s inauguration — came some two weeks after Israel and Hamas signed a ceasefire and hostage release deal. The deal was reached on January 19 — the day before Trump’s inauguration — some 15 months after the Gaza war was sparked on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages. The deal’s 42-day first phase expired on March 2 amid Netanyahu’s refusal to proceed to the second phase, which would have required a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war in exchange for Hamas’s release of all remaining living hostages, with Israel freeing large numbers of Palestinian terrorists and security prisoners. There are 59 hostages still held in Gaza, 35 of whom have been confirmed by Israel to be dead. Israel resumed hostilities in the Strip on March 18. Netanyahu has insisted the war end only once	Hamas’s governing and military capabilities had been demolished. Hamas, meanwhile, has rejected a series of US-backed offers to extend the first phase while continuing to gradually free hostages.
