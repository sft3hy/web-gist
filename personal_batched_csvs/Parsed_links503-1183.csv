https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2z103nqxo,"Mobile phone footage has emerged that appears to contradict Israel's account of why soldiers opened fire on a convoy of ambulances and a fire truck on March 23, killing 15 rescue workers. The video, published by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), shows the vehicles moving in darkness with headlights and emergency flashing lights switched on - before coming under fire. The PRCS said the video was obtained from the phone of a paramedic who was killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially denied the vehicles had their headlights or emergency signals on. But in response to the new video, the IDF told the BBC: ""All claims, including the documentation circulating about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation"". A surviving paramedic previously told the BBC that the ambulances were clearly marked and had their internal and external lights on. The latest video, which the PRCS said had been shown to the UN Security Council, shows the marked vehicles drawing to a halt on the edge of the road, lights still flashing, and at least two emergency workers stepping out wearing reflective clothing. The windscreen of the vehicle being filmed from is cracked and shooting can then be heard lasting for several minutes as the person filming says prayers. He is understood to be one of the dead paramedics. The footage was found on his phone after his body was recovered from a shallow grave one week after the incident. The bodies of the eight paramedics, six Gaza Civil Defence workers and one UN employee were found buried in sand, along with their wrecked vehicles. It took international organisations days to negotiate safe access to the site. Israel claimed a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants had been killed in the incident, but it has not provided any evidence or further explained the threat to its troops. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar earlier this week echoed the army account, saying ""the IDF did not randomly attack an ambulance"". The IDF promised to investigate the circumstances after a surviving paramedic questioned its account. In an interview with the BBC, paramedic Munther Abed said: ""During day and at night, it's the same thing. External and internal lights are on. Everything tells you it's an ambulance vehicle that belongs to the Palestinian Red Crescent. All lights were on until the vehicle came under direct fire."" He also denied he or his team had any militant connections. ""All crews are civilian. We don't belong to any militant group. Our main duty is to offer ambulance services and save people's lives. No more, no less,"" he said. Speaking at the United Nations yesterday the President of the PRCS, Dr Younis Al-Khatib, referred to the video recording, saying: ""I heard the voice of one of those team members who was killed. His last words before being shot…'forgive me mum, I just wanted to help people. I wanted to save lives'. It's heartbreaking"". He called for ""accountability"" and ""an ""independent and thorough investigation"" of what he called an ""atrocious crime"". One paramedic is still unaccounted for following the 23 March incident. Gazan civilians are losing their fear of Hamas, openly criticising the group on the streets and online. Pope Francis had a close relationship with Gaza's tiny Christian community and used his last address to call for a ceasefire. An Israeli military report said ""professional failures"" led to the killing of the 15 rescue workers.

https://www.politico.eu/article/france-risks-missing-deficit-target-because-donald-trump-trade-war-minister-eric-lombard-says/,"PARIS —The trade war with the United States might prevent France from bringing down its sky-high budget deficit, French Economy and Finance Minister Eric Lombard said on Friday. ""Tax revenues would probably fall, and then GDP would fall compared to forecasts, which would worsen the deficit,"" Lombard said in an interview with BFMTV on Friday. U.S. President Donald Trump dumped the European Union in the worst category of America’s trade partners, hitting the bloc with a 20 percent tariff on all imports on Wednesday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has vowed to retaliate. Lombard said that if the trade war escalates and it has a negative impact on France's economic growth, the government plans to accept the fact that its deficit for this year will worsen and won't cut spending nor raise taxes to prevent that. “Even if the situation worsens, I don't want to further cut public spending,"" Lombard said, also excluding tax raises. France had aimed to bring its budget deficit to 5.4 percent of gross domestic product this year, down from 5.8 percent in 2024. The country is already facing an excessive deficit procedure in Brussels after breaching EU spending rules in 2023 that bar member states from running deficits of more than 3 percent of GDP.","France risks missing deficit target because of Trump’s trade war, economy minister says",Giorgio Leali,POLITICO,2025-04-04T09:56:53,2025-04-04T11:10:11,gemini-2.0-flash

 in return for a pact, officials say. BRUSSELS â

 At least a third of EU countries support a German-led plan to allow the U.K. and Canada to take part in a scheme for common purchases of weapons. EU ambassadors on Thursday discussed a plan to offer countries â

150 billion in cheap loans to spend on defense, but the Berlin-led effort to include the non-EU countries ran into opposition from France, which rejected Londonâ

’s participation.

“The French ambassador was quite vocal about this … he warned that would cause delays” to the scheme, said an EU diplomat who, like others quoted in this story, was granted anonymity to speak freely.

France is determined to secure more advantageous fishing rightsÂ
 in return for a U.K.-EU defense deal, according to several officials.

The Security Action For Europe (SAFE) loan plan is part of a broader package that includes exempting defense spending from EU budget limits set and channeling private funding toward the defense industry.

The thorniest issue, however, is whether the U.K., Canada and the U.S. would be allowed to take part in joint purchases under the initiative. According to the Commission’s initial framework, they are out as they do not have a defense deal with the EU.

The proposal limits joint procurement to Ukraine, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, as well as countries vying to join the EU and those with a security and defense partnership with Brussels.

A group of around 10 countries including Germany, Netherlands and Sweden supported opening the joint procurement scheme to the U.K. and Canada.

“We all agree on what should be done: more openness. But there are different approaches on how to get there,” said an EU diplomat.

https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-eu-defense-fund-arms-investment-procurement/,"BRUSSELS — British officials met select European allies at a discreet dinner in Brussels last week to hatch plans for a new defense fund designed to sidestep the European Commission, keep a lid on public debt and rearm faster. The off-the-books gathering brought together senior finance ministry officials from Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom to float the idea of creating a supranational bank specifically for the purpose of jointly buying weapons and slashing the cost of defense procurement, according to officials familiar with the matter. The secret gathering was hosted by Poland, according to one EU official, granted anonymity to speak freely about the confidential discussions, like others quoted in this story. At the center of the pitch was a proposal from the U.K. Treasury, detailed in a discussion paper seen by POLITICO, that would allow participating governments to avoid booking the upfront capital cost of military kit in their national budget, which would be of huge benefit to countries with tight spending rules. With President Donald Trump distancing the U.S. from the protection of Europe as he warms ties with Russia, governments are scrambling to rapidly increase investment in defense, and in many cases aim to go beyond NATO's target of spending 2 percent of economic output. However they have a delicate balance to strike because of self-imposed restrictions on public spending. “The British have a fiscal straightjacket so they are very much interested in this,” said a government official familiar with the dinner. Circumventing the European Commission The scheme would allow the new fund to directly purchase weapons on behalf of members — a power the EU's lender, the European Investment Bank, currently lacks — aiming to tap a dedicated pool of investors comfortable with backing the defense sector. “We wouldn’t be under the control of the Commission and that’s also why it is attractive,” said another EU diplomat. The specialized nature of the fund would, in theory, also improve loan conditions. “As a purely defense sector-focused institution, it would be able to target a specific investor base comfortable with financing the defense sector, rather than try to persuade ESG-conscious investors to add defense sector assets to their portfolio,” says the document. European officials, however, are not convinced the savvy financial engineering will necessarily be enough to convince Southern European countries — including France, Italy, and Spain — to drop their preference for Commission-backed grants funded by joint EU borrowing from capital markets. Countries like Spain and Italy fear that taking on additional debt domestically for defense could hurt their market ratings and spook investors. “I don’t see the Southerners interested in this mechanism, but they are interested in grants,” the EU official said. “I’m not sure if they are yet on the same page.” Northern states, by contrast, are reluctant to support any plan that draws on mutualized debt. Baltic countries and non-EU states such as Norway could be interested in joining the British scheme, but some officials fear moving ahead without Southern European states will risk widening the defense gap in Europe, since the latter are already underspending on defense. Nifty engineering The British-led initiative stands in direct competition with a European Commission plan to offer a €150 billion loan package to support joint defense procurement — a plan that currently excludes the U.K., which since Brexit has not signed a security agreement with the EU. Compared to the EU's current initiatives, London's scheme engineers a fiscal advantage for governments by shifting the “upfront capital cost of purchasing” military equipment to the new institution's balance sheet, freeing up theirs. Governments would instead only be liable for debt interests and maintenance costs. That structure, officials added, is tailored to appeal to states under geopolitical pressure — particularly those near Russia — as fears grow over renewed aggression from Moscow and the prospect of U.S. military disengagement under Donald Trump. Still, key questions remain unanswered, including how the proposed institution would be governed or who would ultimately make decisions — a critical detail given the aim of operating outside the Commission’s remit. The U.K. isn’t the only one eyeing alternatives, however. Poland, currently holding the EU Council presidency, has asked the Bruegel think tank to draw up its own version of a “rearmament bank,” which will be discussed at an informal finance ministers’ gathering in Warsaw on Saturday. “That shows the appetite to look into a mechanism like this,” said a second EU diplomat.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/greece-launches-drastic-rearmament-programme-to-the-tune-of-27bn,"A multi-year strategy will include a balance of US and European weapons, marking a transition towards greater EU autonomy. Athens, Greece â	â	Greece on Wednesday became the first European Union member to take advantage of relaxed spending rules for defence, announcing a 25bn-euro ($27bn) multi-year rearmament programme. The centrepiece of the programme was a multi-layered defence system called the Shield of Achilles, which Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told parliament was â	essentially a dome combining existing air defences with new systems, offering protection on five levels â	 anti-missile, anti-ballistic, anti-aircraft, anti-ship, anti-submarine and anti-droneâ	. It was Greeceâ	â	first multi-year, comprehensive rearmament, and was part of a broader overhaul of the armed forces called Agenda 2030. Mitsotakis described the shift as the â	most drastic transformation in the history of the countryâ	â	armed forcesâ	. As the world is changing at an â	 unpredictable paceâ	, he said, â	We are now facing a different kind of war than we were used to â	 at least the kind our armed forces were prepared for.â	 Greece is a consistent high defence spender due to its adversarial relationship with Turkiye, and is this year set to spend 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence. That is significantly above the European average of 1.9 percent, as estimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Amid a Russian war in Europe and contentious United States fidelity to NATO, the EU last monthdecided to raiseup to 650bn euros ($705bn) in off-the-books additional defence spending. Europeâ	â	 total defence spending in 2023 was $569bn. The EU also offered member states 150bn euros ($163bn) in low-interest loans to strengthen European defence industries. Front-line states Greece and Poland fought hard for the relaxed fiscal rules, and Mitsotakis went further in parliament. â	The Greek government believes that at some point Europe needs to create a fund focused on shared [defence] benefits such as a European anti-missile shield that will cover all European countries and can be funded by European grants to member states, not loans. But we are not there yet,â	 Mitsotakis said. Mitsotakisâ	â	 reasoning was that Brussels could raise money more cheaply than most individual member states, so underwriting collective debt was more cost-effective than borrowing individually. The EU issued its first mutualised debt during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, creating a 730bn-euro ($805bn) stimulus fund. Its 150bn-euro ($165bn) rearmament fund, called Security Action for Europe (SAFE) is made of money left over in that fund. Greece has traditionally bought mostly US weapons, but its bankruptcy in the post-2008 global financial crisis has catalysed a more pro-European trajectory. Years of austerity halved its defence budget to $4.6bn by between 2010 and 2014. Meanwhile, Turkiyeâ	â	 economy and defence budgets grew. As it rearmed on carefully balanced budgets, Greece decided to replace quantity, where it could no longer compete with Turkiye, with quality, and sought more sophisticated weapons systems. The US did not oblige, wanting to maintain a balance between its two east Mediterranean allies, so Greece migrated towards European systems Turkiye did not have. That helped make it an early convert to the cause of European strategic autonomy championed by Franceâ	â	 President Emmanuel Macron. In September 2019, Greece announced it would buy 18 French Rafale fighter-bombers for $2.5bn, and raised that number to 24 a year later. In 2021, Greece penned a strategic defence treaty with France, ordering three state-of-the-art Belharra frigates from Franceâ	â	 Group Naval for 2.26bn-euro ($2.5bn), with an option for a fourth. PM Mitsotakis hailed the agreement in parliament as the cornerstone of an independent European defence policy. â	The defence of European interests in the Mediterranean now acquires new substance,â	 Mitsotakistoldparliament four years ago. â	If attacked, our country will have at its side the most powerful military on the continent, the sole European nuclear power.â	 All 24 Rafales were delivered in record time, and the first frigate, originally laid down for the French navy, is to be delivered this year. The Belharra carry French-made weapons and radar from MBDA, Thales and Dassault. Those include the Aster-30 hypersonic, surface-to-air missiles, capable of travelling at four and a half times the speed of sound and striking aircraft, drones and guided ballistic missiles, MU90 torpedoes, the latest 200km-range (124-mile) Exocet antiship missiles and the Thales Sea Fire radar. The Rafale also carry French weapons, including 100km-range (60 mile) Meteor air-to-air missiles and 500km-range (310 mile) air-to-surface Scalp EG missiles. Last September, Greek Minister of National Defence Nikos Dendias said the second, third and fourth Belharra frigates would also carry the SCALP Naval strategic missile, with a range of more than 1,000km (620 miles). None of these weapons have been sold to Turkiye, although the United Kingdom, a part of the MBDA consortium, now seeks to sell the Meteor missile to Ankara. â	After 1976, we had the 7:10 rule,â	 said Angelos Syrigos, a professor of international law at Panteion University in Athens, referring to a US pledge to supply Greece and Turkiye according to fixed proportions. â	That permeated all systems. In recent years this has changed. We donâ	â	seek a proportionality but a qualitative edge. The SCALP and Meteor missiles are qualitative advantages on the Greek side,â	 he told Al Jazeera. A top priority for Greece is to build up its own defence industrial base, and 12 percent of the Belharra contracts go to Greek companies. Dendias said he aimed to put Greek companies in a consortium building the European Patrol Corvette as well. But Greece is not turning its back on the US. In 2018, Greece penned a $1.3bn deal with the USâ	â	Lockheed Martin to upgrade 85 of its F-16 fighter jets to Viper level, installing advanced radar and weapons systems on board. Last year it ordered 20 fifth-generation F-35 planes from Lockheed Martin, and wants Greek companies to co-develop the next-generation US Constellation frigate. â	Greece is obliged to balance between the US and Europe in defence, because that better consolidates its position,â	 Konstantinos Filis, a professor of international relations at the American College of Greece, told Al Jazeera. â	It cannot be one-track. And the EU and US also need Greece, because itâ	â	 in an area of strategic interest to both.â	 Follow Al Jazeera English:",Greece launches ‘drastic’ rearmament programme to the tune of $27bn,John T Psaropoulos,Al Jazeera,2025-04-03T11:34:03Z,2025-04-03T11:34:03Z,gemini-2.0-flash

China's Landbridge group was granted a 99-year lease on the port in 2015, a widely criticized decision that led to stricter scrutiny of major infrastructure sales. The port is the closest to Australia's Asian neighbors and a base for U.S. Marines who rotate in and out of the country. ""We want it to be in Australian hands,"" Albanese told public broadcaster ABC radio Friday, describing the port as a ""strategic asset."" The government preferred that an Australian firm acquire the port lease, and it had held informal talks with potential buyers including Australian pension funds, he said. But it was also prepared to intervene and use taxpayers' money to make it a state asset. Albanese, who faces a general election on May 3, said Landbridge had not invested sufficiently in the port to ""bring it up to scratch."" The prime minister said his center-left Labor Party had long criticized the lease as ""short-sighted for economic reasons, but also for national security reasons."" ""You would recall at the time it was criticized by (then-U.S.) President (Barack) Obama as well — gave the Australian government a rebuke at the time.""

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250405001300320,"SEOUL, April 5 (Yonhap) -- Hyundai Motor Co. will freeze prices of all new vehicles sold in the United States through early June, a move aimed at easing consumer concerns over rising costs following Washington's imposing of 25 percent duties on all imported vehicles, the automaker's American subsidiary said. Hyundai Motor America (HMA) said in a press release Friday (U.S. time) that any new Hyundai vehicle purchased until June 2 will be protected from Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) increases regardless of changes in market conditions under the company's Customer Assurance program. Washington's measure of imposing 25 percent tariffs on imported cars went into effect this week, part of U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive drive to reduce America's trade deficits and bolster domestic manufacturing. ""We know consumers are uncertain about the potential for rising prices and we want to provide them with some stability in the coming months,"" Jose Munoz, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Hyundai Motor, said. ""Our MSRP commitment is just one part of our multifaceted effort to provide great vehicles to American consumers."" Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, said the price protection measure builds on Hyundai's March and first-quarter sales momentum and reflects the company's ""legacy of supporting American consumers and investing in the U.S. market."" Hyundai Motor added that the MSRP freeze is part of its broader U.S. strategy, which also includes a US$21 billion investment plan from 2025 to 2028 aimed at expanding manufacturing and technology operations and creating more than 100,000 jobs.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250404002700315,"SEOUL, April 4 (Yonhap) -- South Korea and the United States have recently agreed on a plan to temporarily deploy Patriot missile defense batteries from the South to the Middle East, sources said Friday, amid speculation over a potential shift in the role of the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK).

The allies agreed last month on the ""monthslong"" partial deployment of the Patriot Advanced Capability-3, the first known case involving the relocation of USFK assets to the Middle East, according to the sources.

The missiles work alongside South Korea's own air defense assets in a multilayered missile defense system against North Korea's missile and nuclear threats, according to the sources.

The rare move comes after U.S. broadcaster NBC News reported last week that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized at least two Patriot missile defense batteries from Asia to be moved to the Middle East as the U.S. takes military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels.

But it also comes amid growing concerns here that Washington may demand that Seoul further shoulder the cost of the upkeep of the USFK or reconsider the role of U.S. troops in South Korea as U.S. President Donald Trump takes a ""transactional"" approach to alliances.

The USFK reaffirmed its ironclad commitment to the Korean Peninsula, without providing further details, citing internal policy, when asked about the latest deployment.

""USFK will temporarily deploy personnel and equipment from the Republic of Korea as part of a rotational deployment,"" it said in a statement. ""USFK will still maintain a ready, capable, and lethal force on the Korean peninsula prepared to respond to any contingency.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/4/israel-has-turned-two-thirds-of-gaza-into-no-go-land-un-says,"The latest displacement orders in Rafah and Gaza City have forced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee again. Israel has now restricted Palestiniansâ	M access to roughly two-thirds of Gaza, either by declaring large areas as no-go zones or issuing forced displacement orders, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Among the restricted areas is a large swath of southern Rafah, where Israelâ	Ms military issued a new displacement order on March 31, declaring it was returning to â	Mcfight with great forceâ	M. The restrictions also cover parts of Gaza City, where Israeli troops launched anew ground offensiveon Friday morning to expand their â	Msecurity zoneâ	M. These escalations have triggered one of the largest mass displacements of the war, pushing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians â	M many already displaced multiple times â	M to flee yet again. â	MOur biggest struggle now is displacement,â	M Abu Hazem Khalef, an elderly man displaced from Gaza Cityâ	Ms east, told Al Jazeera. â	MWe have no idea how to handle this situation. Iâ	Mm heading west of Gaza City, looking for any street where I can set up a tent.â	M â	MWe are being forced to leave and we donâ	Mt even know where to go,â	M added Mahmoud al-Gharabli, another displaced Palestinian. â	MWe are exhausted and completely broken.â	M The military push follows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ	Ms threat to intensify the offensive to pressure Hamas into further concessions. â	MWe are now dividing the Strip and we are increasing pressure step by step so they will give us our hostages,â	M Netanyahu said in a video message on Wednesday. On Friday, Israeli forces continued devastating aerial attacks, killing at least 38 people, medical sources told Al Jazeera. This followedan intense day of bombardmenton Thursday that left 112 dead â	M many of them women and children. Conditions inside Gaza Cityâ	Ms al-Ahli Hospital, also known as the Baptist Hospital, where manyvictimsin the north were taken, are â	Mnothing short of apocalyptic,â	M Al Jazeeraâ	Ms Hani Mahmoud said after visiting the facility. â	MWe are seeing bodies laid on the ground and they are counted in the 10s,â	M Mahmoud said. â	MWeâ	Mve seen doctors, they are helpless. They donâ	Mt know what to do. They are unable to save lives given the dire situation inside the hospital.â	M Israel resumed its attacks in Gaza on March 18, shattering a two-month ceasefire after talks with Hamas broke down over the next phase of the agreement. Netanyahu wants Hamas to release the 59 remaining Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and aid, but without Israel committing to end the war or pull out troops. For a final ceasefire deal, Netanyahu insists Hamas must disarm â	M a demand the group calls a â	Mred lineâ	M â	M and has openly backed plans for Israel to seize security control of Gaza and push Palestinians out.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-iran-pulling-forces-out-of-yemen-amid-intensive-us-airstrikes-on-houthis/,"Iran has reportedly ordered its military personnel to leave Yemen and is pulling back its support for the Houthis amid extensive US airstrikes on the rebel group. The British Telegraph newspaper on Thursday cited a “senior Iranian official” saying that Tehran is scaling back its support of its regional proxies to focus on the direct threats emanating from the US administration. “Every meeting is dominated by discussions about [US President Donald Trump],” the official was quoted as saying. According to the official, Iran’s pullback from Yemen was designed to avoid the possibility of escalation if an Iranian soldier is killed in US airstrikes there. Tehran is focusing its efforts instead on how to respond to Trump and his litany of threats, and “none of the regional groups we previously supported are being discussed,” the official said. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories “The view here is that the Houthis will not be able to survive and are living their final months or even days, so there is no point in keeping them on our list.” “They were part of a chain that relied on Nasrallah and Assad, and keeping only one part of that chain for the future makes no sense,” the official continued, referring respectively to the former leaders of the Hezbollah terror group and Syria. A handout picture provided by the office of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei shows him greeting Mohammed Abdulsalam (L), spokesman for Yemen’s Houthi movement, in Tehran on July 30, 2024. (Iranian Supreme Leader’s Website) The Telegraph report came amid a US aerial campaign agains the Houthis that has seen near-daily strikes in rebel-held areas of Yemen since March 15. The strikes are aimed at stopping the Iran-backed group from attacking commercial shipping in solidarity with the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas. Washington has since said it is sending a second aircraft carrier group to Middle East waters to bolster its campaign to “deter aggression and protect the free flow of commerce.” The Houthis had halted their attacks on shipping during a six-week ceasefire in Gaza earlier this year, but they announced they were resuming them after Israel cut off aid to the territory before returning to fighting against Hamas. Since then, the Houthis have launched drone and missile attacks on both US warships and Israel. On Thursday, the Houthis said a strike they blamed on the United States killed a guard at a communications tower, among more than 30 strikes on rebel-held parts of Yemen. “An American aggression targeted the communications network in… Ibb governorate, leading to the martyrdom of Abdulwasim Abdulwahab Zahir, the communications tower guard,” Houthi health ministry spokesman Anees Alasbahi said on social media. People assess the damage following reported overnight US strikes that Houthi rebels said hit the Water Management building in Mansouriya in Yemen’s Hodeida governorate, on April 2, 2025. (AFP) Earlier, the Houthis’ Al-Masirah television said more than 20 strikes had hit Saada province, the rebels’ stronghold in the northern mountains. It said Washington had carried out two strikes on vehicles, one south of the rebel-held capital Sanaa and another in Saada province. In a video statement, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said the United States had launched “over the past few hours more than 36 air strikes” in different parts of the country. Saree said the group had targeted US aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman in response. He also claimed the group had shot down an “American MQ-9 drone” as it was “carrying out hostile missions” in Hodeida province on the Red Sea coast.",Report: Iran pulling forces out of Yemen amid intensive US airstrikes on Houthis,"ToI Staff, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-04-04T01:49:48,2025-04-04T05:22:17,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-widens-ground-operation-in-northern-gaza-kills-senior-hamas-official-in-lebanon/,"The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that it had expanded its ground operations in the northern Gaza Strip, with troops pushing into Gaza City’s eastern Shejaiya neighborhood. According to the military, the operations are aimed at expanding Israel’s buffer zone along the Gaza border. The IDF said that so far, troops have killed several terror operatives and destroyed infrastructure, including a Hamas command center. The military said it is enabling civilians to evacuate the area “for their safety.” It had issued evacuation warnings for Shejaiya on Thursday. Israel had issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of ground operations. The UN humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the ceasefire with Hamas fell apart last month. Throughout the war, the IDF has issued evacuation orders for various areas, advising residents to head for safe zones to avoid being caught up in the fighting. Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields by embedding its fighters among the population. In an update later on Friday, the military said that a deputy commander of a Hamas Nukhba force company was killed in a recent drone strike in the northern Gaza Strip. The strike was directed by troops of the 401st Armored Brigade. The brigade killed several more operatives and destroyed rocket launchers and other Hamas infrastructure during their operations in northern Gaza, the IDF said. Gaza’s civil defense agency said Friday that military operations had killed at least 30 people in the Palestinian territory since dawn, adding that the toll was “not final.” The figures cannot be verified. A single Israeli strike on Khan Yunis killed at least 25 people, a medical source at the southern city’s Nasser Hospital told AFP. “The situation is very dangerous, and there is death coming at us from every direction,” Elena Halas told AFP via text message, adding that she and her family were trapped in her sister’s house in Shejaiya. A number of the Palestinians leaving the targeted areas in northern Gaza Thursday did so on foot, with some carrying their belongings on their backs and others using donkey carts. “My wife and I have been walking for three hours covering only one kilometer,” said Mohammad Ermana, 72. The couple, clasping hands, each walked with a cane. “I’m searching for shelters every hour now, not every day,” he said. Israel restarted intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 and then launched a new ground offensive, ending a nearly two-month ceasefire in the war with Hamas. The war erupted on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists rampaged through southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages to Gaza. Hamas-controlled health officials said on Thursday that 1,163 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the large-scale strikes resumed, bringing the overall death toll since the war began to 50,523. The toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. Israel says it killed at least 20,000 combatants and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced earlier in the week that troops would carve out a new security corridor that will seemingly cut off Rafah as it seeks to pile pressure on Hamas, which continues to hold 59 Israeli hostages. IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Thursday that the military has begun a “new stage” in the operation designed to return the hostages and destroy “Hamas’s military and governing capabilities.” Meanwhile, a senior Hamas commander was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the coastal Lebanese city of Sidon overnight, the military announced. Hassan Farhat had headed Hamas’s forces in the western sector of Lebanon, according to the IDF. The Israeli airstrike had hit an apartment building in Sidon. During the war, the military said, Farhat advanced numerous attacks on Israeli civilians and IDF troops, and was responsible for a rocket attack on the Northern Command base in Safed on February 14, 2024, killing Staff Sgt. Omer Sarah Benjo and wounding other troops. “The terrorist was involved in advancing terror attacks against the State of Israel in recent months, and his activities constituted a threat to the State of Israel and its citizens,” the IDF said. Footage from the scene of the strike showed one floor of the apartment block in flames, with smoke pouring out of it. The other floors appear to be relatively unscathed. Reports of a precision-airstrike earlier by the Israeli Air Force, on an apartment building inside the city of Sidon in southern Lebanon. Reports that the target eliminated in Sidon was a senior Hamas official. It is also reported that his family was eliminated along with him. Hamas has a significant presence in Lebanon and is allied with the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group. Both are backed by Iran. In February, an IDF strike killed another senior Hamas commander in Sidon. Israel accused him of plotting and advancing terror attacks from Lebanon against Israeli civilians, with Iranian funding and guidance. Under the November ceasefire with Lebanon, which ended over a year of Hezbollah-instigated fighting, the terror group was obligated to pull its forces north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the Israeli border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south, while the Lebanese army deployed to control the area. Israel, meanwhile, was obligated to withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon within 60 days. The withdrawal deadline was pushed off, with Lebanese and US approval, to February 18. Israel eventually withdrew from all of Lebanon except for five strategic posts along the border. Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly accused each other of violating the agreement, which gives Israel the right to act against imminent threats by terror groups.","IDF widens ground operation in northern Gaza, kills top Hamas official in Lebanon","Emanuel Fabian, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-04-04T07:30:35,2025-04-04T07:30:35,gemini-2.0-flash

Central Asian leaders invited the European Union with a mix of enthusiasm and caution to gather on Thursday and Friday in Samarkand, situated along the historic Silk Road trade routes which now serves as Uzbekistan's host city for major diplomatic meetings The aim is to “significantly strengthen ties”, said the EU's ambassador to Uzbekistan, Toivo Klaar. Among the few announcements expected at the summit itself is the the creation of a European Investment Bank office in Tashkent, and plans for a European investment forum to be held in Uzbekistan before the end of the year. A “Samarkand declaration” that will reflect “the common aspiration of the parties to establish a strategic partnership” is also expected at the summit. Talks will touch on issues including connectivity, the environment and security as this year's EU focus considerably shifts to critical minerals. In this part of Eurasia, which has long been seen as a backwater by many in the EU, has seen a renewed interest from the West since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which upended long-standing economic relations and led Europeans to reconsider their geopolitical position. The landlocked former Soviet republics in Central Asia – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – are strategically significant, with governments still close with Moscow and much courted by Beijing. Russian firms have used the region as a base for efforts to circumvent Western economic sanctions. Europeans are seeking to strengthen their influence with Central Asian governments for this reason. But efforts to secure supplies of important minerals, and Europe's urgent need to diversify energy supplies, are also key motivations. This is what Brussels is actively seeking, as the EU currently depends almost entirely on China for supplies of those resources. In March, the European Commission unveiled a plan to revive mining, including projects in third countries, less than a year after EU legislation aimed at securing the supply of critical raw materials came into force. ""We see the EU is very interested in Central Asia,"" said Han Ilhan, a consultant and board advisor to the Uzbekistan Technological Metals Complex. ""Many projects are being discussed right now.” Central Asia could become something like the El Dorado of European dreams. The 34 critical raw materials identified as needed by the EU – including cobalt, copper, tungsten, lithium and nickel – are present in large quantities in the Central Asian subsoil. “It's a little-known region, yet all the Central Asian countries are among the top 10 richest in terms of ores and rare earths, varying by type of material, with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan ahead of the pack,” said Roman Vakulchuk, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. “The investment climate is not very favourable, so we are not yet seeing a rush of Western rare metals western mining companies into Central Asia. But it won't be long,” said a French diplomat in Kazakhstan. The diplomat pointed in part to the absence of international standards in the mining sector in Central Asian countries. That hasn't stopped some European firms from plunging into the region. Germany's HMS Bergbau AG is implementing a joint project to exploit lithium deposits in eastern Kazakhstan. In November, Astana and Paris signed a roadmap for a strategic partnership in the field of critical resources and materials that runs through 2026. The deal should enable French companies to penetrate the Kazakh geological market as early as this year. At the EU level, Commissioner for External Partnerships Joseph Síkela signed a €3 million partnership agreement with Kazakhstan on critical raw materials and rare earths on March 13. Last May, Uzbekistan signed a memorandum of understanding with the EU for the same sector. The EU may have arrived late to Central Asia. China has been interested in its neighbours' underground resources for over a decade, and Chinese fims already hold most of the licenses and mining sites in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The majority of critical mineral exports from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are currently reserved for Beijing. Russia, for its part, has for decades largely secured its uranium needs from the region, which the Kremlin regards as its strategic ""near abroad"". The region is also economically dependent on Moscow for many infrastructure projects. On the other hand, the rush for critical metals in Central Asia has not gone unnoticed by other newcomers such as the United States, Canada and South Korea, all of which have recently signed major deals with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. ""Despite its fine words, the European Union is only involved in two or three projects in Central Asia. That's very little and very slow, even though it has been interacting with these governments for decades,"" Vakulchuk said, pointing out that rare metals are not mentioned in the EU's 'Global Gateway' strategy until 2023. But the region is still heavily dependent on Russia and China, which remains a sensitive issue. “We see from Central Asia a wish to deepen relationships with the EU and diversify their foreign policy,” one top EU official said. As the Samarkand summit approaches, European interest seems to have been appreciated – but has been greeted with caution, with no statement from Central Asian republics suggesting that the EU will play a greater role in the region.

https://www.dw.com/en/nato-members-seek-assurances-at-summit-amid-us-tariffs/a-72126524,"Foreign ministers from NATO member statesmet in Brussels on Thursday just hours after US President Donald Trump sparked anger among allies with a new sweeping round of tariffs. Relations between the US and its NATO allies in Europe as well as Canada have been tense
since Trump came to office pledging to impose tariffs over what he called unfair trade balances. There have also been fears that the US will pull its forces out of Europe, especially after comments by high-level figures in the Trump administration. But on Thursday, ahead of the meeting, NATO chief Mark Rutte sought to assuage these fears, saying there would be no ""sudden"" withdrawal of US forces from Europe. ""There are no plans for them to all of a sudden draw down their presence here in Europe,"" Rutte, the former Dutch prime minister, said. He went on to say that the US had to ""attend to more theaters than one."" Rutte sidestepped a question about what he thought the reaction would be to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also attending the summit. ""The focus here of all 32 [NATO members] is how to defend NATO territory against the Russians, our long-term threat, which will be there even after, I hope there will be a deal on Ukraine,"" Rutte told journalists. Asked whether he thought the US was still a trustworthy ally in NATO, Rutte said ""Absolutely, they are."" For his part, Rubio said that NATO members should increase their defense spending to 5% of GDP ahead of the talks. ""We do want to leave here with an understanding that we are on a pathway, a realistic pathway, to every single one of the members committed and fulfilling a promise to reach up to 5% of spending. That includes the US,"" he said. 
In an attempt to show Washington's continued commitment to the alliance, Rubio said the US was ""as active as it has ever been."" Edited by: Wesley Dockery",NATO members seek assurances at summit amid US tariffs,Alex Berry,Deutsche Welle,2025-04-03T11:49:48,2025-04-03T19:47:28,gemini-2.0-flash

Pak In-chol, chairman of the North's SPA, met with the delegation led by Kazbek Taysaev, secretary of the Russian Communist Party's central committee, at Mansudae Assembly Hall the previous day and held talks ""in a friendly atmosphere,"" the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. Also present at the meeting were Ri Chol, president of the Academy of Medical Science under the public health ministry and chairman of the North Korea-Russia friendly parliamentary group, and Russian Ambassador Alexandr Matsegora, the KCNA said, without further elaboration. The delegation arrived in Pyongyang on Monday in the latest of a series of high-level exchanges between the countries. They are ramping up cooperation in a range of sectors, including the military, economy and public health following the signing of a mutual defense treaty last June between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko was reported as saying last week that preparations were underway for a visit by Kim to Russia.

Bombing nuclear infrastructure would have catastrophic consequences for the entire world, Zakharova says, adding that Iran has the right to peaceful nuclear energy. Iran claims that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful and denies seeking a nuclear weapon, but has ramped up its enrichment of uranium up to 60 percent purity, the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so, and has obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities.

https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-giorgia-meloni-coalition-war-in-ukraine-eu-rearmament-donald-trump/,"Europe's massive rearmament plans — and the EU's role in Ukraine — are turning into a splitting political headache for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni as she grapples to hold her right-wing coalition government together. As leader of the EU’s No. 3 economy, Meloni, a committed transatlanticist, is conspicuously not buying into more gung-ho rhetoric from France and Germany that Europe’s time has come to build global heavyweight militaries and to replace America as the main guarantor of Ukraine’s security against Russia. In part, Meloni’s caution on European rearmament reflects her sincere belief that Rome should not be making a binary choice about siding with the EU against U.S. President Donald Trump. But there’s also a significant domestic political calculus at play. On Meloni's right flank, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini is seeking to revive his political fortunes by playing to widespread voter skepticism about a major peacekeeping role within Ukraine (only 6 percent of Italians think that’s a good idea, polls suggest), as well as to broad concern over the effect of increased military spending on Italy's already squeezed finances. Meloni doesn't want to be seen as being pulled toward a warzone by the ambitions of Paris and Berlin. The prime minister's challenge is that her coalition has to balance the interests of the far-right League party of Salvini, an admirer of Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, with those of another major partner, the center-right Forza Italia party of her other deputy, Antonio Tajani, who is far more pro-European and has even publicly supported a European army. While Meloni's government is unusually stable by Italian standards, she has to contain the sparring between Salvini and the EU-oriented Tajani. The two have clashed over the idea of a European army, with Salvini even scoffing that such a force should never be led by ""madman"" French President Emmanuel Macron. These political strains are most discernible in Meloni’s shifting rhetoric over the past weeks. She has downplayed her previous confidence that Ukraine will achieve victory, raised serious doubts about the EU's plans to rearm, and poured cold water on the prospect of European countries going it alone without U.S. firepower. ""I don't think I have used the word 'victory' with respect to the war in Ukraine,"" Meloni told the Italian parliament last month, contradicting her earlier stance. She went on to denounce one of the European Union's founding texts and to decry the ""childish"" false dichotomy between Europe and Brussels, and continued to push a controversial idea that would see NATO security guarantees extended to Ukraine without the country joining the alliance. Her EU-friendly allies in the ruling coalition insisted in remarks to POLITICO that Meloni remains a committed European at heart and that her recent comments were mostly about throwing a bone to Salvini. But the big question is whether she has nevertheless underestimated the extent to which Trump is truly turning his back on Europe. “The way Trump has acted these past two months, how can you act as a mediator?” asked Giovanni Orsina, professor of contemporary history at Luiss University in Rome. “And now she risks going from being friends with both sides, to becoming an enemy of both.” Rearmament reticence While she is still committed to Europe, Meloni's change in rhetoric does reflect Rome's genuine skepticism of the pace and scale of the EU's rearmament plans, according to Italian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to speak freely.  The main issue is the European Commission's proposed bloc-wide rearmament plan, which would consist of €150 billion in cheap loans and greater fiscal flexibility of up to €650 billion for countries that don't have enough fiscal headroom. Italy has pushed for more private sector involvement in the rearmament plan, which it fears would otherwise lead to a surge in borrowing costs at a time when it is under EU orders to shrink its exorbitant debt pile. | Gints Ivuskans via Getty Images According to two people familiar with the government's position, Rome is aware that it is weaker and smaller than France and Germany, and has a more realistic view of Europe's undeveloped defense sector and its limited chances against Russia without the U.S., whose extensive supply chains are deeply interwoven with the bloc's military capabilities. As POLITICO reported last month, Italy has also pushed for more private sector involvement in the rearmament plan, which it fears would otherwise lead to a surge in borrowing costs at a time when it is under EU orders to shrink its exorbitant debt pile. Like the United Kingdom, Italy's close relationship with the U.S. has reduced its dependence on its European neighbors, said one person familiar with the thinking in Rome, adding that the country does not want to be at the ""mercy"" of France and Germany should the transatlantic alliance fall apart. While France has ""always had a cold relationship with the United States ... no Italian government has ever questioned the relationship with the U.S. on defense,"" Italian General Leonardo Tricarico, who was military advisor to several prime ministers, told POLITICO. After Italy's defeat in World War II, added the person quoted above, ""we learned forever that there is not a place for us as a global superpower. We can play a role everywhere in the world, but we can do it only if we are together with the U.S. Certainly we must also do it within the EU — but not only within the EU."" A transatlantic breakup would also make it harder for both Europe and the U.S. to tackle China, the official added. Allies are seemingly already aware of Italy's discomfort. In an interview with leading Italian daily Corriere della Sera over the weekend, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sought to reassure Rome that its leading defense firm, Leonardo, would ""benefit greatly"" from the defense spending push and play a significant role in a rearmed Europe. On top of that, the latest update to the EU rearmament plans — which includes provisions for private-sector financing — already goes some way toward appeasing Rome's concerns. But none of that is likely to reassure Meloni fully. In the view of Stefano Stefanini, a former top Italian diplomat and NATO ambassador, Meloni's actions also reflect a faith, perhaps misplaced, that the transatlantic alliance can still be saved, and that its demise has been exaggerated. Center-left lawmaker and former European Affairs Minister Enzo Amendola agreed, telling POLITICO that the premier's reconciliation efforts would leave Italy in a ""no man's land between the EU and the U.S."" Nevertheless, it's a view shared by Italians across the political spectrum.""I doubt there will ultimately be a complete rupture between the United States and the European Union,” said Danilo Della Valle, an MEP with the left-populist 5Star Movement. European rearmament is, after all, what Trump is asking for, he added.  One of the people familiar with the government’s thinking went so far as to argue that tensions with the U.S. were being exploited by opportunistic French and German leaders — and that a rearmed Germany was actually more dangerous than Russia or the U.S. A spokeperson for the Italian government declined to comment. Coalition clashes But such geopolitical concerns are ultimately outweighed by local ones for Meloni, particularly Salvini's increasing inclination to veer off-piste.  The firebrand's star has been overshadowed by Meloni in recent years, and a League congress in Florence next month threatens to expose deep divisions within the party's own ranks. As a result, Salvini is taking pains to display his populist credentials and revive support among his flagging base, and has drawn criticism for unilaterally engaging with the U.S. administration — including an unauthorized call with Europe-hating Vice President JD Vance last month — and for his repeated calls for Meloni not to back the EU defense plans. Geopolitical concerns are ultimately outweighed by local ones for Giorgia Meloni, particularly Matteo Salvini's increasing inclination to veer off-piste. | Pierre Teyssot via Getty Images To be sure, Salvini is unlikely to blow up the coalition anytime soon, having learned the risks of political showboating after his disastrous exit from a coalition government with the 5Star Movement in 2019, League Senator Claudio Borghi told POLITICO. The politician added that Meloni’s shift on Ukraine has largely appeased League lawmakers, and that the premier — if forced to choose — would attempt to deal with the U.S. bilaterally, as Rome sought to do during Trump's previous term.  But even as Meloni scrambles to reclaim her territory on the right, her recent actions also suggest she may be feeling out pro-European alternatives to the garrulous Salvini, according to Francesco Galietti, a former Treasury official and founder of the political risk consultancy Policy Sonar. Over the weekend Meloni caused some surprise by praising her centrist political rival Carlo Calenda, who leads the small Azione party that is broadly loathed by the far-right — and is a vocal supporter of EU rearmament. ""This is her hedge against Salvini,"" argued Galietti. At an Azione conference, Meloni denied she was looking into a formal alliance with Calenda, even if the quasi-endorsement of the EU-friendly leader was a reminder of her own continued support for the bloc. But as Trump's shadow looms large, the limits of that support are being sorely tested. ""If she comes to a point where she has to choose between supporting and not supporting Ukraine, she's too committed to Ukraine to drop it,"" said Stefanini, the diplomat. ""But she will try to avoid making any choice — as long as she can."" ",Italy’s Meloni strains to hold her coalition together over Ukraine and EU rearmament,"Ben Munster, Elena Giordano, Giovanna Faggionato",POLITICO,2025-04-02T22:17:00,2025-04-06T14:21:18,gemini-2.0-flash

Hungary’s government, led by right-wing populist Orbán, extended the invitation to Netanyahu in November after the ICC, based in the Hague, Netherlands, issued the warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity. Orbán, a close Netanyahu ally, has called the arrest warrant “outrageously impudent” and “cynical.” Member countries of the ICC, such as Hungary, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that and relies on states to comply with its rulings.",Hungary plans to withdraw from International Criminal Court as Netanyahu arrives despite warrant,,AP News,2025-04-03T08:15:41,2025-04-03T04:15:41,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/argentina-britain-falklands-war-history-anniversary-memorial-veteran-8c5e25dc6b68b838c7ac2f04a9c7857b,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina’s libertarian President Javier Milei on Wednesday marked the anniversary of his nation’s failed 1982 attempt to forcibly wrest the Falkland Islands from Britain by expressing hope that the island’s residents may one day choose to be Argentine rather than British. Milei’s speech came as a surprise to many in Argentina, which still claims sovereignty over the British-controlled archipelago that it calls Las Malvinas despite the British victory. His comments were criticized as overly conciliatory by political rivals who argue that the island’s residents have no right to self-determination because they are not an Indigenous people. “We hope for the Malvinenses (Falkland Islanders) to one day decide to vote for us with their feet,” Milei said at a ceremony commemorating Argentina’s 74-day war over the South Atlantic territory that killed 649 Argentine service members and 255 British soldiers. “That’s why we seek to be a power, to the point that (the islanders) prefer to be Argentine.” The island’s roughly 3,000 residents most recently voted to remain a British overseas territory in a 2013 referendum — a result rejected by then-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a left-leaning populist who made Argentina’s claims to Las Malvinas a centerpiece of her foreign policy. As president and more recently vice-president over the last decade, Kirchner repeatedly condemned U.K. control over the islands as a colonial holdover and sought to press Britain to enter talks about the future of the territory that it has ruled since 1833. On Wednesday, Kirchner and her political allies — ideological opponents of the right-wing president — castigated Milei for his accommodating approach to Britain. “There is no self-determination after the occupation and expulsion,” former Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero wrote on social media platform X in reaction to Milei’s speech, accusing him of “surrendering” the nationalistic claims for which Argentines fought and died. Even politicians from the center-right PRO party expressed confusion over Milei’s stance on an issue that long has forged a unifying sense of Argentine patriotism. During Milei’s 2023 presidential campaign, the former TV pundit set off a firestorm by admitting that he idolized fellow libertarian Margaret Thatcher, the U.K. prime minister who dispatched troops to retake the Falklands after Argentina’s waning military dictatorship mounted its invasion. Eager to quiet mounting controversy on Wednesday, Cabinet officials insisted that Milei’s remarks constituted no change of policy. “Milei wasn’t just referring to self-determination, he was saying that we will not cease efforts at any table or forum,” Defense Minister Luis Petri told local journalists who peppered him with questions from the memorial plaza after Milei’s speech. The war’s 43rd anniversary also exposed tensions within the highest rungs of government. Victoria Villarruel, Milei’s vice-president and a fiery advocate for Argentina’s military whose father fought in the 1982 war, flew over 2,800 kilometers (1,700) miles to Argentina’s chilly southernmost coast on Wednesday to lead a separate memorial ceremony. Villarruel took the stage in Ushuaia — from which Argentine troops first set off to recapture the islands — to shouts of “Long live the homeland!” shortly after a local veteran affairs official delivered a speech condemning Milei’s remarks on self-determination. “Our country must define a clear and unambiguous policy of national defense,” Villarruel said, her voice rising.",Argentina's President Milei draws pushback over his Falklands War speech,ISABEL DEBRE,AP News,2025-04-02T18:59:48,2025-04-02T14:59:48,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250403006200320,"SEOUL, April 3 (Yonhap) -- President Yoon Suk Yeol has decided not to appear before the Constitutional Court for his impeachment ruling later this week, his legal team said Thursday. The Constitutional Court has said it will deliver its ruling on Yoon's impeachment over his short-lived martial law bid at 11 a.m. Friday. The decision was made in consideration of public order and security concerns, as congestion is expected, the legal team said. Yoon was impeached by the National Assembly on charges of violating the Constitution and laws through his brief imposition of martial law on Dec. 3. Yoon has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the declaration was meant as a warning to the main opposition party for what he described as its abuse of legislative power. Under the Constitution, the consent of at least six justices is required to uphold an impeachment motion. There are currently eight justices on the bench. President Yoon Suk Yeol (L) talks with his lawyer, Yun Gap-geun, during the 10th hearing of his impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Feb. 20, 2025, over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/top-news/modi-leaves-for-thailand-sri-lanka-says-visit-to-bolster-ties-benefit-region-101743646746990.html,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday left for a four-day visit to Thailand and Sri Lanka to participate in the Bimstec Summit in Bangkok and to bolster relations with the two countries. Modi departed hours after US President Donald Trump slapped what he said were 26% “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on Indian exports to the US, and a formal Indian response is expected from the commerce ministry, people familiar with the matter said. TheThailandleg of the visit will be watched closely for a possible encounter or meeting between Modi andBangladeshinterim government chief Muhammad Yunus. People familiar with planning for the trip had earlier said a formal meeting is unlikely, but the Bangladesh side has made a strong push for a meeting over the past few days. In a statement ahead of his departure, Modi said he expected the visits to build on foundations of the past and contribute to strengthening India’s close relationships for the benefit of the wider region. He said he was travelling to Thailand at the invitation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to attend the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) Summit. Over the past decade, Bimstec has emerged as a “significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region”, he said. Noting that India’s northeastern region lies at the heart of Bimstec, Modi said he would meet leaders of the grouping and engage “productively to further strengthen our collaboration”. Since India stymied the activities of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) by pulling out of a summit to be hosted by Pakistan in 2016, it has focused on Bimstec – which includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand – as a platform for driving regional cooperation. A maritime cooperation agreement is expected to be signed during the Bimstec Summit in Bangkok on April 4. Modi will also have bilateral meetings with Shinawatra and the Thai leadership to bolster relations between the two countries. He will hold talks with Shinawatra on Thursday evening before participating in a dinner hosted by the Thai premier for the Bimstec leaders. Following the summit on Friday, Modi will meet Thai King Vajiralongkorn. Modi will travel from Thailand to Sri Lanka on Friday evening. This trip follows the visit of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to India last December. “We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of ‘Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future’ and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,” Modi said. The people said India and Sri Lanka are expected to sign up to 10 agreements during the visit, including a crucial pact to refresh defence cooperation for the first time since the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) intervention during the island nation’s civil war in the late 1980s.","Modi leaves for Thailand, Sri Lanka, says visit to bolster ties, benefit region",Rezaul H Laskar,Hindustan Times,2025-04-03T07:54:47,2025-04-03T07:54:47,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-thailand-earthquake-a5ce6c6bd211eba0df4a1e0bf6808a43,"BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s ruling military declared a temporary ceasefire in the country’s civil war Wednesday to facilitate relief efforts following a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that has killed more than 3,000 people. The surprise announcement by military leaders who also head the unelected government came late Wednesday on state television MRTV, which said the halt in fighting would run until April 22 to show compassion for people affected by Friday’s quake. The announcement followed unilateral temporary ceasefires announced by armed resistance groups opposed to military rule, and the military warned that those groups must refrain from attacking the state and regrouping, or else face “necessary” measures. The resistance forces have also reserved the right to fight in self-defense. Earlier Wednesday, rescuers pulled two men alive from the ruins of a hotel in Myanmar’s capital, a third from a guesthouse in another city, and another in the country’s second city, Mandalay, five days after the quake. But most teams were finding only bodies. The quake hit midday Friday, toppling thousands of buildings, collapsing bridges and buckling roads. The death toll rose to 3,003 on Wednesday, with more than 4,500 people injured, MRTV reported. Local reports suggest much higher figures. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports China says a relief convey in Myanmar has arrived at its destination. The quake worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis due to Myanmar’s civil war. More than 3 million people had been displaced from their homes and nearly 20 million were in need even before it hit, according to the United Nations. In the capital, Naypyitaw, a team of Turkish and local rescue workers used an endoscopic camera to locate Naing Lin Tun on a lower floor of the damaged hotel where he worked. They pulled him gingerly through a hole jackhammered through a floor and loaded him on to a gurney nearly 108 hours after he was first trapped. Shirtless and covered in dust, he appeared weak but conscious in a video released by the local fire department, as he was fitted with an IV drip and taken away. State-run MRTV reported later in the day that another man was saved from the same building, more than 121 hours after the quake struck. Both were age 26. Another man, a 47-year-old primary school principal, was rescued by a team of Malaysian and local crews from a collapsed guesthouse in the Sagaing township, near the epicenter of the earthquake close to Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, where a fourth rescue was reported Wednesday night. The earthquake also rocked neighboring Thailand, causing the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok. One body was removed from the rubble early Wednesday, raising the death total in Bangkok to 22 with 35 injured, primarily at the construction site. Myanmar’s military seized power in 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into significant armed resistance. Ceasefires had been announced earlier this week by the People’s Defense Force, which is the armed wing of the shadow opposition National Unity Government, and the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a trio of ethnic minority guerrilla armies. That had put pressure on the military government to follow suit, said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies. It’s too early to say whether a pause in fighting could lead to something longer lasting, he said. “It would require very deft and active diplomacy to transform a humanitarian pause into something more lasting. And that’s not guaranteed,” Morgans said. The military government was particularly vulnerable to bad publicity this week because its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, was expected for a high-profile visit to a regional conference in the Thai capital Thursday. It will be his first to a country other than his government’s main supporters and backers — China, Russia and Russia ally Belarus — since he attended another regional meeting in Indonesia in 2021. Min Aung Hlaing and other senior leaders are shunned and sanctioned by many Western countries for their 2021 takeover and human rights abuses as they try to crush the resistance to their rule. Before Wednesday’s ceasefire announcement, an opposition militia belonging to the Brotherhood Alliance reported that the military fired on a relief convoy of nine Chinese Red Cross vehicles late Tuesday in the northern part of Shan state. The Ta’ang National Liberation Army said that the Chinese Red Cross was bringing supplies to Mandalay and had reported its route to the military. But Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the military government, said that the convoy hadn’t notified authorities of its route ahead of time, MRTV reported. While not mentioning the Red Cross, he said that security forces had fired into the air to deter a convoy that refused to stop. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun didn’t comment on the attack. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was looking into the matter. Countries have pledged millions in assistance to help Myanmar and humanitarian aid organizations with the monumental task ahead, while also sending in specialist search and rescue teams and setting up field hospitals. India and China, both neighbors of Myanmar that compete for influence there, have been especially quick and generous with assistance. Multiple other countries have sent teams, including Turkey, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia. The U.S. government has pledged $2 million in emergency aid and sent a three-person team to assess how best to respond given drastic cuts to U.S. foreign assistance. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that continuing aftershocks are complicating humanitarian response efforts. In Mandalay City, many people are completely cut off from electricity and running water. “People affected continue to need urgent healthcare and medical supplies, safe drinking water, food and other critical items,” Dujarric said. “Tents and temporary shelter are needed, as well as latrines and other hygiene items, to prevent disease outbreaks.” Most of the details so far have come from Mandalay, which was near the epicenter of the earthquake, and Naypyitaw, about 270 kilometers (165 miles) north of Mandalay. Many areas are without power, telephone or cellphone connections, and difficult to reach by road, but more reports are beginning to trickle in. In Singu township, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Mandalay, 27 gold miners were killed in a cave-in, the independent Democratic Voice of Burma reported. In the area of Inle Lake, a popular tourist destination northeast of the capital, many people died when homes built on wooden stilts in the water collapsed in the earthquake, the Global New Light of Myanmar reported. ___ Matthew Lee in Washington, Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Jintamas Saksornchai and Grant Peck in Bangkok contributed to this report.","Myanmar's military declares a ceasefire to ease quake relief as deaths pass 3,000",DAVID RISING,AP News,2025-04-02T07:25:39,2025-04-02T03:59:49,gemini-2.0-flash

https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Natural-disasters/United-Nations-urges-ramp-up-in-aid-to-earthquake-hit-Myanmar,"BANGKOK (Reuters) -- United Nations officials who surveyed earthquake damage in Myanmar urged the global community on Tuesday to ramp up aid before the looming monsoon season worsens already catastrophic conditions, with the death toll at 2,719 and expected to surpass 3,000. Drinking water, hygiene, food, shelter and medicine are the most critical needs following extensive damage to buildings, roads and bridges, said Marcoluigi Corsi, acting humanitarian and resident coordinator following a two-day visit. ""We remain, of course, deeply committed to reaching people in Myanmar who need aid,"" U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. ""And we must act swiftly to provide relief before the upcoming monsoon season, which, of course, will even worsen this horrendous crisis."" A civil war in Myanmar had displaced more than 3 million people long before the quake struck. U.N. Special Envoy for Myanmar Julie Bishop urged all sides to immediately cease fire, permit humanitarian access and ensure aid workers are safe. ""Continuing military operations in disaster-affected areas risks further loss of life,"" she said in the statement. Aid groups in Myanmar warned that the window to find survivors was closing fast. Myanmar's military ruler Min Aung Hlaing said the death toll from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake reached 2,719 as of Tuesday morning and was expected to surpass 3,000. Some 4,521 people were injured and 441 missing. ""Among the missing, most are assumed to be dead. There is a narrow chance for them to remain alive,"" he said in a speech. The quake, which struck at lunchtime on Friday, was the strongest to hit the Southeast Asian country in more than a century. It toppled ancient pagodas and modern buildings alike and inflicted significant damage on Myanmar's second city Mandalay and Naypyitaw, the capital the previous junta purpose-built to be an impregnable fortress. U.N. agencies said hospitals were overwhelmed and rescue efforts hindered by infrastructure damage and the civil war. Rebels have accused the military of conducting airstrikes even after the quake and on Tuesday a major rebel alliance declared a unilateral ceasefire to help relief efforts. The earthquake was the latest in a succession of blows for the impoverished country of 53 million people following a 2021 coup that returned the military to power and devastated the economy after a decade of development and tentative democracy. Myanmar's military has been accused of widespread atrocities against civilians as it fought to quell a multi-pronged rebellion after the coup. It has dismissed the accusations as misinformation and says it is protecting the country from terrorists. In neighboring Thailand, the death toll from the quake rose to 21 on Tuesday, with hundreds of buildings damaged. Rescuers kept searching for life in the rubble of a collapsed skyscraper under construction in the capital Bangkok, but acknowledged time was against them. The region has been hit by five more aftershocks. Julia Rees of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF said she witnessed entire communities in Myanmar that had been flattened, with immense destruction and psychological trauma. ""And yet, this crisis is still unfolding. The tremors are continuing. Search and rescue operations are ongoing. Bodies are still being pulled from the rubble,"" she said in a statement. ""Let me be clear: the needs are massive, and they are rising by the hour. The window for life-saving response is closing."" In the Mandalay area, 50 children and two teachers were killed when their preschool collapsed, the U.N. humanitarian agency said. In a rare survival story, a 63-year-old woman who was trapped for 91 hours was pulled from the rubble of a building in Naypyitaw on Tuesday in a joint rescue effort by the Myanmar fire department and teams from India, China and Russia. Myanmar's civil war has complicated efforts to reach those injured and made homeless, including tight controls over the internet and communication networks. The Three Brotherhood Alliance of three major rebel groups at war with the junta on Tuesday declared a unilateral one-month ceasefire, to allow urgent humanitarian efforts to ""be carried out as swiftly and effectively as possible"". In its nightly news bulletin on Tuesday, state-controlled MRTV quoted Min Aung Hlaing as saying the military had halted its offensives but unspecified ethnic minority armies were planning to exploit the disaster. ""The military is aware they are gathering, training, and preparing to attack,"" it said, quoting the general as saying at an event to raise funds for quake victims. ""We consider it as attacking us and will respond accordingly."" One rebel group, the Karen National Union, on Sunday said the junta had conducted airstrikes in the east of the country at a time when it should be prioritizing quake relief efforts. Amnesty International said it had received testimony corroborating reports of air strikes near areas where quake recovery efforts were focused. ""You cannot ask for aid with one hand and bomb with the other,"" said Amnesty's Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman. It was unclear if Min Aung Hlaing would make a rare foreign trip this week to attend a regional summit in Bangkok as planned. Thailand's on Tuesday said the general may attend by teleconference. In Bangkok, rescuers were still seeking signs of life in the ruins of an unfinished skyscraper that collapsed, aware that four days after the quake, chances had dimmed of finding survivors. Fourteen deaths have been confirmed at the site and seven elsewhere in the city. The government is investigating the collapse and initial tests showed some steel samples from the site were substandard. There were an estimated 70 bodies under the rubble and experts said 12 had been located using scanners, but access was blocked by large debris. ""Maybe they can survive one week or two weeks, so we have to go on,"" Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said. ""The experts still have hope.""",United Nations urges ramp-up in aid to earthquake-hit Myanmar,Staff Writer,Nikkei Asia,2025-04-01T21:21:12,2025-04-01T21:21:12,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/mexico-security-trump-sheinbaum-lopez-obrador-ddb4d905e38bab9b9a1560df28a06331,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Six years ago Mexico’s president disbanded the country’s Federal Police and handed security responsibilities fully to the military. Now, his successor has quietly begun to build an elite civilian investigative and special operations force to fight the drug cartels. President Claudia Sheinbaum had already shown a willingness early in her presidency to move away from former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s oft-criticized “hugs, not bullets” strategy. It focused on addressing the social roots of crime rather than directly confronting Mexico’s powerful cartels. Sheinbaum’s security chief, Omar García Harfuch, is drawing on his law enforcement contacts — mostly from the former ranks of the Federal Police — to claw back security capabilities from the armed forces with a civilian force under his direct command. The government has yet to formally announce the new National Operations Unit, known by its Spanish initials UNO, but its existence is an open secret among former members of the Federal Police, where García Harfuch started his career. Three Mexican officials, all of whom requested anonymity to speak about the still unannounced force, confirmed its existence to The Associated Press. Security analyst David Saucedo, who has spoken with people who have joined the force, said he believes García Harfuch’s main objective is to have an armed force that allows him to meet demands from Washington. UNO takes shapeThe unit began to form shortly after Sheinbaum took office and it hopes to have 800 members by the end of the year, said one federal official, who is familiar with many of the unit’s details. On Monday, while García Harfuch was in Washington meeting with the Trump administration, the security ministry published a call for college graduates to make up “the first generation of investigative and intelligence agents,” saying only they would be part of a specialized group to strengthen the country’s security. UNO will have three branches distributed geographically across Mexico, as well as a high-impact team that will be the “elite of the elite,” the federal official said. Its current members are mostly former Federal Police and members of the special operations team García Harfuch created when he was Mexico City’s police chief. Most have previously received training from security forces from the United States, Colombia, Spain or France. His challenge is rebuilding the trust of his U.S. counterparts after López Obrador limited U.S. agents’ movements in Mexico and do it as President Donald Trump pressures Mexico to step up the fight against fentanyl trafficking. A controversial pastShortly after taking office, López Obrador replaced the Federal Police with a new force, the National Guard, that he sold to the public as civilian, but that was always led by and made up of the armed forces. He lambasted the Federal Police as too corrupt to save and made Mexico’s former security chief Genaro García Luna, then facing trial in the U.S. and eventually convicted of working for the Sinaloa cartel, the poster child. He cut funding for training and equipping local police. What followed were six years of what critics decried as militarization that effectively concentrated unprecedented authority in the hands of the armed forces. Despite that, levels of violence remained stubbornly high and critics said the cartels grew stronger, fueled by soaring revenue from fentanyl. One of the main criticisms of the National Guard and military was that while they had numbers and fire power they did not have the investigative skills needed to dismantle large criminal organizations. García Harfuch was initially a “toothless tiger,” who was frequently denied resources, information and investigative files by other security entities, said Saucedo, based in Guanajuato state, Mexico’s most violent. UNO puts an elite force under his direct command. The Mexican federal official denied that UNO’s objective was to satisfy Trump, but noted the unit was involved in the unprecedented delivery of 29 high-profile cartel figures to the United States at the height of negotiations between the two countries to suspend threatened tariffs. They were pulled out of prisons all over Mexico, assembled and sent to the U.S. without incident. The challenge: avoid corruptionSpecial operations forces, be it from the Navy, Army, Federal Police or state police, have a checkered history in Mexico, having been involved in many scandals and abuses of power, extrajudicial killings and infiltration by cartels. “There have been a lot of cases that were bad,” said the previously quoted federal official, who added that there were also honest police. He said the security ministry is emphasizing stricter screening, exhaustive background investigations and better pay once they’re in. García Harfuch’s influence also extends to states where Sheinbaum’s party holds power. People he trusts are taking key security positions and UNO will train state special operations teams that are also made up of many former Federal Police. The southern state of Chiapas, where Mexico’s most powerful cartels are battling for control of smuggling routes, announced a special operations force in December called the Pakal with some 500 members. Two members told the AP they were ex-Federal Police and did eight months of specialized training to join the Pakal. But doubts remain. For Saucedo, since the new elite force doesn’t yet have effective internal controls and accountability mechanisms, “there’s no guarantee that this elite group won’t commit the excesses committed by other special operations groups.” ___ Associated Press writer Edgar H. Clemente in Tapachula, Mexico contributed to this report.",Mexico's security chief quietly forms an elite force to take on the drug cartels,María Verza,AP News,2025-04-01T17:49:11,2025-04-01T19:48:25,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rferl.org/a/brussels-foreign-ministers-rubio-nato/33365613.html,"On April 3-4, NATO foreign ministers will gather in Brussels for their regular spring meeting. Much like at the defense ministerial in February, all eyes will be on the American representative. Then, it was Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth; this time, it's Secretary of State Marco Rubio. When Rubio was first slated for the role in the new Trump administration, most Europeans rejoiced. He was seen as an ardent ""transatlanticist."" Now, there is a certain nervousness, according to the NATO diplomats I have spoken to. While some say, ""He still gets us and the alliance,"" they wonder what influence he really has within the US government and what he will say when it comes to Ukraine, Russia, and China. Two things, however, are apparent. Just like Hegseth, Rubio will hammer home the message that European allies need to step up on defense spending and burden sharing. And, just like in February, the allies will hope that the United States reconfirms its commitment to NATO and its mutual defense clause, Article 5. Since the only other NATO gatherings before the alliance's June summit are an informal foreign ministers' meeting in Turkey in mid-May and a defense ministers' session in early June, this week's meeting serves very much as a dress rehearsal for the summit in The Hague on June 24-26. The goal for that meeting is clear: Keep the alliance together by considerably ramping up defense spending. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte is pushing for every ally to commit to spending at least 3.7 percent of gross domestic product on defense as quickly as possible and with regular progress reports. This push is aimed at placating US President Donald Trump at the summit, but some European allies will be reluctant to commit too much on defense too soon given they are struggling with low growth and ballooning budget deficits. Will Rubio Snub The EU's Kaja Kallas Again? Perhaps the one thing to look for during the ministerial is the session devoted to NATO-EU relations, with the latter represented by the European bloc's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas. Rubio snubbed Kallas when she traveled to the United States earlier this year, and all EU diplomats I have spoken to admit that Washington doesn't see the EU as a serious interlocutor. There is also plenty of tension, not least when it comes to the European Commission's latest defense spending proposal: a potential 150 billion euro ($163 billion) loan for EU member states to buy arms, though not from non-European countries. The United States is especially wary of any moves that would lock it out of a European defense-spending splurge. But the biggest irritant, of course, is the fraying relationship on trade. Just one day before the NATO meeting, the United States is set to impose a 25 percent tariff on all vehicle imports, a move that will hit countries like Germany especially hard. This follows existing US duties on European steel and aluminum, which Brussels is planning to counter with retaliatory measures on April 13. Will The US Ramp Up Pressure On Russia? Another guest at the ministerial is Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha. An update on the situation on the battlefield is expected but, again, it will be Rubio who is in the spotlight. Will the United States increase pressure on Russia in case the cease-fire deals concerning infrastructure and Black Sea traffic aren't holding? While Ukraine's membership in NATO is off the table for now, most European allies are keen to at least get assurances that US weapons will continue to go to Ukraine and that NATO's training mission for Ukrainian soldiers, NSATU, continues to operate. So far, everything is still working. There also haven't been any changes when it comes to US troop posture on NATO's eastern flank. From Dayton To Riyadh: Can Shuttle Diplomacy End The Ukraine War? What has changed, however, is that the United States is no longer chairing the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, known as the Ramstein group, which coordinates military support for Kyiv. The United Kingdom already chaired the last meeting of the group in February, and the next one tentatively scheduled for April 11 could be co-chaired by the UK and France. Expect London and Paris to also continue working, at least on the sidelines of the ministerial, on a potential reassurance force in Ukraine should a permanent cease-fire take hold. However, details such as troop numbers, participating countries, and the exact mandate will have to remain sketchy for now. What's become increasingly apparent is that work on a new NATO strategy for Russia has stalled. The strategy -- defining how the alliance should engage with Moscow going forward -- was supposed to be endorsed at the Hague summit. But Washington has indicated that it wants to avoid introducing potential ""irritants"" on the path to a final peace deal, and such a strategy document could be exactly that. Finally, the foreign ministers of NATO's four Asia-Pacific partners -- Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea -- will also be participating in a session at the explicit request of the United States. While the US administration sees Beijing as a rival, its public criticism of China has so far been relatively muted. In this session, ministers will be keen to hear Rubio's comments on how to approach a range of China-related issues.","At Brussels Foreign Ministers Summit, All Eyes Will Be On Marco Rubio",Rikard Jozwiak,RFE/RL,2025-04-01T18:44:55,2025-04-01T18:44:55,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.rferl.org/a/hungary-israel-netanyahu-iccc-arrest-warrant/33366535.html,"When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Hungary, it is virtually certain he will not be detained despite an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged war crimes in Gaza. As a signatory to The Hague court, Hungary has an obligation to arrest him, but its domestic legal situation is complicated and has given the government enough wiggle room to welcome him. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban publicly extended an invitation to Netanyahu in November shortly after the ICC issued the warrant. The Israeli leader was scheduled to arrive on April 2 for a four-day visit. ""I will guarantee him, if he comes, that the judgment of the ICC will have no effect in Hungary,"" Orban said. Meanwhile, diplomatic sources inside Hungary told RFE that the country had decided to withdraw from the ICC, though this could not be immediately confirmed officially. What Are The Political Reasons? The politics of all this are clear. Orban has closely aligned himself with Netanyahu and with US President Donald Trump, who has also criticized the court's warrant. Trump issued sanctions against the ICC last month, criticizing as ""baseless"" its arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto welcomed the decision with a social media post, accusing the ICC of being a ""political tool."" The indictment says Netanyahu is ""allegedly responsible for the war crimes of starvation as a method of warfare and of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024."" Hungarian Family Lives Under Constant Threat In Village That Proclaims Itself 'Roma Free' What's The Legal Position? The legal situation is more complex. The court cannot arrest anyone; rather, it relies on countries who have signed onto the treaty creating the court -- the Rome Statute -- to enforce its warrants. ""It is not for states to unilaterally determine the soundness of the court's legal decisions,"" court spokesman Fadi El-Abdallah told RFE He said it was a ""legal obligation to the court"" to enforce them. This view was endorsed by two senior lawyers who spoke to RFE ""If Mr. Netanyahu visits a state party like Hungary or Germany and is not arrested, this state violates its obligations under the Rome Statute of the ICC,"" said Kai Ambos, professor of criminal and international law at Germany's Goettingen University. ""The nonexecution of ICC arrest warrants undermines the court's legitimacy,"" said Ambos, who serves as a war crimes judge at the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, an international court set up for crimes committed during the 1990s Kosovo conflict. Tamas Adany, an associate professor of international law in Hungary, agreed with this but also pointed to a nuance. ""Globally speaking, there are countries where, whenever they ratify an international treaty, it becomes part of the law of the land,"" he said. ""Most other countries, where the typical language of multilateral treaties is not an official language…rely on a process called promulgation"" to make an international obligation part of national law, he said. What's Fueling Protests In Georgia, Hungary, Romania, And Serbia? Hungary ratified the Rome Statute in 2001 under the first Orban government. But it has never carried out the second step, which basically amounts to incorporating the statute into the country's own national legal code. ""The question is hard because Hungary is under a legal obligation from the perspective of international law to comply with this. But Hungarian national law does not make it possible for the authorities [to do so],"" Adany said. This reasoning has also been used by the Hungarian authorities. ""Thanks to former President Janos Ader, we had the sense to never make it part of domestic law,"" government spokesman Gergely Gulyas said on March 13. Yet Adany said the law was not entirely clear on this point, because Netanyahu is accused of crimes that have been considered part of customary international law since the 1940s. ""I'm very positive that those parts of the Rome Statute, which are considered by a majority of states to be customary international law in nature, should be enforced in Hungary even without a formal promulgation,"" he said. Is Hungary Alone? Gulyas pointed to another reason for not arresting Netanyahu. When the court warrant was issued, Germany offered an ambiguous response. ""I find it hard to imagine that we would make arrests on this basis,"" government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said, adding that legal questions had to be clarified about the warrant. Then, in January, Christian Democrat leader Friedrich Merz said he would find ""ways and means"" to invite Netanyahu to Germany. Merz's party subsequently won federal elections, and he is now preparing to take office as the country's next chancellor. Gulyas, the Hungarian government spokesman, seized on this. ""Since a country of Germany's size and power thinks that it must disregard its own domestic law because the decision of the International Criminal Court is so absurd, what is the point of the whole thing?"" he said. What Would Be The Consequences? Merz's comments were hugely controversial in Germany. Ambos said there could be ""sanctions"" for not carrying out an arrest warrant, imposed by the ICC's Assembly of State Parties, which is responsible for various court matters, including the election of judges and prosecutors and setting its budget. ""Such a situation just arose with regard to Vladimir Putin's visit and nonarrest in Mongolia,"" he added, referring to the Russian president's visit there in September. ICC Arrest Warrant Will Dog Netanyahu Even If He Never Faces The Hague 	 Putin is wanted for the war crime of abducting children from Russian-occupied Ukraine. ""The consequence for Hungary is that we may possibly lose our voting rights in the Assembly of States Parties,"" Adany said, adding there could be a ""judicial investigation into this conduct of Hungary."" The political fallout might be quite limited. Hungary is already highly isolated within the European Union, where it has been accused of democratic backsliding and curtailing media freedom. Its pro-Russia positions have also led to diplomatic problems. ""I'm absolutely positive that the arrest is not going to happen,"" Adany said. ""Netanyahu is going to travel home safely.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36718p52eyo,"President Vladimir Putin has called up 160,000 men aged 18-30, Russia's highest number of conscripts since 2011, as the country moves to expand the size of its military. The spring call-up for a year's military service came several months after Putin said Russia should increase the overall size of its military to almost 2.39 million and its number of active servicemen to 1.5 million. That is a rise of 180,000 over the coming three years. Vice Adm Vladimir Tsimlyansky said the new conscripts would not be sent to fight in Ukraine for what Russia calls its ""special military operation"". However, there have been reports of conscripts being killed in fighting in Russia's border regions and they were sent to fight in Ukraine in the early months of the full-scale war. The current draft, which takes place between April and July, comes despite US attempts to forge a ceasefire in the war. There was no let-up in the violence on Tuesday, with Ukraine saying that a Russian attack on a power facility in the southern city of Kherson had left 45,000 people without electricity. Although Russia has turned down a full US-brokered ceasefire with Ukraine, it says it did agree to stop attacking Ukraine's energy facilities. In an apparent attempt to deny Moscow had broken the terms of that deal, Russian officials said they had told Putin that Ukrainian drones had carried out attacks with little sign of a break. Russia calls up conscripts in the spring and autumn but the latest draft of 160,000 young men is 10,000 higher than the same period in 2024. Since the start of last year, the pool of young men available for the draft has been increased by raising the maximum age from 27 to 30. As well as call-up notices delivered by post, Russia's young men will be receiving notifications on the state services website Gosuslugi. In Moscow there were reports that call-ups had already been sent out on 1 April via the mos.ru city website. Increasing numbers of Russians are trying to avoid the army by taking on ""alternative civilian service"". But human rights lawyer Timofey Vaskin warned on independent Russian media that every new call-up since the start of the war had become a lottery: ""Authorities are coming up with new forms of refilling the army."" Quite apart from its twice-yearly draft, Russia has also called up large numbers of men as contract soldiers and recruited thousands of soldiers from North Korea. Moscow has had to respond to extensive losses in Ukraine, with more than 100,000 verified by the BBC and Mediazona as soldiers killed in Ukraine. The true number could be more than double. Putin has scaled up the size of the military three times since he ordered troops to capture Ukraine in February 2022. Russia's defence ministry linked the December 2023 increase in the size of the military to ""growing threats"" from both the war in Ukraine and the ""ongoing expansion of Nato"". Nato has expanded to include Finland and Sweden, as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Finland has Nato's longest border with Russia, at 1,343km (834 miles) and Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Tuesday that his country would join other states neighbouring Russia in pulling out of the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines. Poland and the Baltic states made similar decisions two weeks ago because of the military threat from Russia. Orpo said the decision to resume using anti-personnel mines was based on military advice, and that the people of Finland had nothing to worry about. The government in Helsinki also said defence spending would be increased to 3% of economic output (GDP), up from 2.4% last year. The FSB say they detained a ""Ukrainian special services agent"". Kyiv has not commented on the attack. Plymouth-based frigate HMS St Albans monitored the Admiral Golovoko as it entered the Channel. The US president's envoy meets Vladimir Putin in Moscow, while Ukraine calls for more pressure on Russia. As Russia and the US seek to repair ties, could they secure a peace deal acceptable to Ukraine, asks the BBC's Russia editor.

https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-launch-permanent-troop-deployment-lithuania-nato-eastern-flank-russia-ukraine/,"BERLIN — Germany officially launched its first permanent foreign troop deployment since World War II	 on Tuesday — a 5,000-strong armored brigade in Lithuania — as Berlin moves to bolster NATO’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine. According to the German military’s lobbying group, the newly created 45th Armored Brigade was formally activated during a ceremony outside Vilnius. A temporary headquarters was established, with the brigade's crest unveiled and the unit now officially under the command of Brigadier General Christoph Huber. “We have a clear mission: to ensure the protection, freedom and security of our Lithuanian allies on NATO’s eastern flank,” Huber told dpa, the German press agency. “In doing so, we also protect NATO territory — and Germany itself.” Berlin pledged the long-term deployment in 2023, breaking with decades of German defense policy that avoided permanent stationing of combat troops abroad. The unit is set to be fully operational by 2027 and will eventually be based in a new military complex in Rūdninkai, roughly 30 kilometers south of Vilnius. Until then, troops will operate out of temporary Lithuanian bases. The plan includes not just frontline forces but also support units — such as a medical center, signal company and command support teams — across multiple locations. Currently, 150 German troops are stationed in Lithuania. That number is expected to reach 500 by year’s end. For NATO, the deployment represents a critical part of the alliance’s shift to deterrence by forward defense. For Germany, it’s a major step in shedding its reputation as a reluctant military power. Lithuania, which borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave and Kremlin ally Belarus, sees the move as vital to its national security. The war in Ukraine has turned the Baltic region into a frontline zone — and Berlin’s presence into a symbol of NATO’s long-term commitment.",Germany launches permanent troop deployment on NATO’s eastern flank,Chris Lunday,POLITICO,2025-04-01T05:27:02,2025-04-01T05:27:25,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/eu-tariffs-trump-reciprocal-liberation-us-von-der-leyen-f840e2963db21508937e644e3cb6d974,"BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union official warned the U.S. on Tuesday that the world’s biggest trade bloc “holds a lot of cards” when it comes to dealing with the Trump administration’s new tariffs and has a good plan to retaliate if forced to. U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to roll out taxes on imports from other countries on Wednesday. He says they will free the U.S. from reliance on foreign goods. He’s vowed to impose “reciprocal” tariffs to match the duties that other countries charge on U.S. products, dubbing April 2 “Liberation Day.” “Europe has not started this confrontation. We do not necessarily want to retaliate, but if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told EU lawmakers. The commission, the EU’s executive branch, negotiates trade deals on behalf of the bloc’s 27 member countries and manages trade disputes on their behalf. “Europe holds a lot of cards, from trade to technology to the size of our market. But this strength is also built on our readiness to take firm counter measures if necessary. All instruments are on the table,” von der Leyen said, at a European Parliament session in Strasbourg, France. The commission already intends to impose duties on U.S. goods worth some $28 billion in mid-April in response to Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs. The EU duties will target steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and farm goods. A lot remains unknown about how Trump’s levies will actually be implemented, notably the “reciprocal” tariffs, and the EU wants to assess their impact before taking retaliatory action. “So many Europeans feel utterly disheartened by the announcement from the United States,” von der Leyen said. “This is the largest and most prosperous trade relationship worldwide. We would all be better off if we could find a constructive solution.”",Europe says that it holds a lot of trade cards on the eve of Trump's tariff 'Liberation Day',,AP News,2025-04-01T04:34:35,2025-04-01T05:42:34,gemini-2.0-flash

https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-power-facility-in-kherson-left-city-without-electricity-despite-ceasefire/,"Some 45,000 residents of Kherson were left without electricity after a morning Russian attack on one of the city's power facilities, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on April 1 during a joint press conference with his Lithuanian counterpart Kestusis Budrys. The attack happened after Russia andUkraineannounced apartial ceasefireon strikes against energy facilities following technical consultations with the U.S. in Riyadh the previous week. ""After Riyadh, one of the agreements with the U.S. was about not striking at energy infrastructure,"" Sybiha said at the press conference. ""At the same time, Russia continues to violate this agreement,"" the minister said, adding that Ukraine has also recorded attacks against energy facilities in the Kherson, Kharkiv, and Poltava oblasts since March 25. According to thelocal military administration, the Central and Korabelnyi districts of Kherson are without electricity. Electric transport is partially out of service due to the outages. Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has consistently used targeted missile and drone strikes to knock out Ukraine's power grid, while Kyiv has hit oil and gas facilities inside Russian territory with long-range drones. Ukraine and the U.S. previously agreed on a full30-day truceduring their talks in Jeddah on March 11. Russia had rejected this proposal unless it included conditions undermining Kyiv's ability to defend itself, such as a full halt on foreign military aid. Moscow has claimed that its side of the energy ceasefire has been in effect since March 18, when Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly declared ahalt on such attacksfollowing a call with U.S. President Donald Trump. In spite of this, Russian forces also reportedly attacked Kherson'senergy infrastructureon March 27, violating the terms of the U.S.-brokered limited ceasefire.","Russia again violates partial ceasefire by attacking Kherson energy facility, Kyiv says",Kateryna Hodunova,The Kyiv Independent,2025-04-01T06:28:38.000,2025-04-01T07:10:56.000,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-april-1-2025/,"The Times of Israel liveblogged Tuesday’s events as they unfolded. Two Iranian businessmen have been indicted for allegedly conspiring to procure US parts to build military attack drones, the Justice Department says. Hossein Akbari, 63, and Reza Amidi, 62, are charged with money laundering and providing material support to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which the United States designates as a foreign terrorist organization. According to court documents, Akbari is the chief executive of a company called Rah Roshd while Amidi is the commercial manager. The Justice Department says Akbari and Amidi, who previously worked at Qods Aviation Industries (QAI), an Iranian state-owned aerospace company, are both at large. “The defendants conspired to obtain US-origin parts needed to manufacture drones for military use in Iran and send those parts to Iran in violation of export control laws,” US Attorney John Durham says in a statement. “The IRGC and QAI have been core players in the Iranian military regime’s production of drones, which threaten the lives of civilians, US personnel and our country’s allies.” According to the Justice Department, Akbari and Amidi have evaded US sanctions since 2020 to procure US parts for use in Iranian-made drones, including the Mohajer-6. A Mohajer-6 drone used by the Russian military was shot down by the Ukrainian Air Force in September 2022 and found to have parts manufactured by several US-based companies, it says. Former hostage Eliya Cohen, who was snatched by Hamas terrorists from the Nova music festival and held captive for 505 days, tells Channel 12 that his captors drastically increased the amount of food he was given during his last weeks in captivity after the gaunt appearance of hostages released before him sparked international outrage. Cohen was held captive with Eli Sharabi and Or Levy, who were returned to Israel on February 8, dangerously emaciated. The three were also held together withAlon Ohel, who has yet to be released. He tells Channel 12 that for the majority of his time in captivity, he received very little food. “You can deal with being humiliated, you can deal with being cursed at, you can deal with your legs being in chains,” he says. “Hunger is a daily struggle because, beyond being hungry, you are also fighting for your life. Every night, you go to sleep thinking, ‘what am I going to do tomorrow to get that piece of pita bread?'' He says that most days, their captors would give each of the four men a piece of pita, and one or two spoonfuls of beans or peas, but on other days, “I would beg God for that to be the case. For it to be a dry pita with two spoons of beans.” He says sometimes the terrorists would bring them three pitas instead of four, and ordered the men to share, claiming they would give them another one later in the day. “You find yourself begging — and they enjoy it,” he says. “They know they are starving you.” Cohen says that occasionally, he and the other hostages would try and make a personal appeal for their captors to provide them with more food, and were successful. “I can’t describe that feeling when you suddenly manage to pull on his heartstrings and they quietly enter the room and bring you some pita, or chocolate bar or peanut butter bar,” he tells Channel 12. “It’s the best thing that has ever happened to you in your life at that moment, because you survived another day.” Although he had no access to the outside world for the duration of his captivity, Cohen says he realized that a ceasefire deal must have been signed when, in late January, his captors started appearing “very, very happy.” “Suddenly more food started coming in,” he says. “A month before we went home, a [Hamas] commander arrived. He saw us in terrible condition and ordered us to be unchained because essentially, ‘the fighting is over.''” He says that their terrorist captors started “stuffing us with a lot of food, in particular after Eli and Or were released. It made a stir.” Despite having been severely malnourished up until that point, Cohen says he didn’t struggle to adjust to the larger quantities of food. “You are so insecure from the lack of certainty of nutrition and food that you want to put anything in your mouth,” he says. The US State Department announces that President Donald Trump’s senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs Massad Boulos has also been appointed its senior adviser for Africa. As part of the new role, Boulos will travel later this week to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda to meet with government officials and business leaders in addition to “advancing efforts for durable peace in the eastern DRC and to promote US private sector investment in the region,” the State Department says. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will take off from Ben Gurion International Airport for Budapest on Wing of Zion at 11:15 p.m. Wednesday night. He is slated to meet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and TamÃ¡s Sulyok on Thursday. As he usually does, Netanyahu will remain abroad over Shabbat at taxpayer expense and will return to Israel on Sunday afternoon. Maj. Gen. (res.) Sami Turgeman, former head of the IDF’s Southern Command, is in the running to become the next Shin Bet chief, according to multiple Hebrew media reports. An official in the Prime Minister’s Office denies the reports, telling The Times of Israel that “Turgeman is not a candidate for the head of the Shin Bet.” Turgeman was in charge of the Southern Command during the 2014 Operation Protective Edge against Hamas in Gaza while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in office. Current IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir was Netanyahu’s military secretary at the time and replaced Turgeman in 2015. Turgeman is CEO of Noga, an independent company that manages Israel’s electric system. Last month, Zamir appointed Turgeman to head an external panel of former senior officers to evaluate the military’s probes into Hamas’s October 7, 2023, onslaught and oversee the implementation of the findings. Earlier today, Netanyahu announced thathe was backtrackingon his decision to appoint Vice Adm. (res.) Eli Sharvit as the next head of the Shin Bet following a whirlwind day of criticism of the nomination both in Israel and abroad. Netanyahu is looking to replace Ronen Bar, who was formally fired by the cabinet earlier this month but who remains in his post thanks to a temporary injunction imposed on his dismissal by the High Court of Justice, which is hearing petitions against the firing. Though the court froze Bar’s firing, it allowed Netanyahu to interview candidates to replace him. Accepting the US State Department’s 2025 International Woman of Courage Award, former Hamas hostage and sexual assault survivor Amit Soussana calls for global action to secure the immediate release of the remaining captives in Gaza. “It is an incredible honor to stand before you today, but it is also a deeply painful moment,” says Soussana, who is one of eight women from around the world presented with the award at a State Department ceremony in Washington, but the only one given a personal shout-out by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and the only one asked to give keynote remarks to those in attendance. Soussana is presented with the award by Rubio and First Lady Melania Trump. “While I am here, my friends remain in the darkness. Five hundred and forty-three long days and nights. They are still suffering, still waiting, still hoping. Their voices remain unheard. So I will speak for them. We cannot move forward until they are free,” Soussana says in her remarks. Soussana was taken captive during Hamas’s October 7 onslaught and released as part of the first hostage release and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in November 2023. Since her release, she has advocated around the world on behalf of those still held in Gaza and became the first former hostage to speak about the sexual violence she endured while in captivity. “In captivity, I had no control over my body, no control over my life. I resisted as best as I could, but it was not enough to stop what happened to me,” she says. “The darkness was suffocating. Yet even in the darkness, there was one thing they could not have taken from me, the strength my mother instilled in me. The belief that we must always stand for what is right, no matter the cost.” “I vowed that if I would survive, I would never be silent. I would speak — not just for myself, but for every woman who had been silenced,” Soussana says. “When I first told my story, I only wanted to raise awareness about the horrors of captivity and the terror of October 7, but my story became part of a much bigger conversation — one about sexual violence, about war and about the unimaginable strength of women in the face of brutality.” “In Israel, we’re about to celebrate Passover — the story of liberation, of breaking free from bondage. But this will be the second Passover that the hostages remain in captivity,” she laments. “I accept this award, not for myself, but in the name of all the brave women of Israel, the women who endure, who led, who refused to break. Women are stronger. We are the stronger gender, not because we do not feel pain, but because we rise from it, because we fight — not just for ourselves, but for those who cannot fight for themselves.” “This award comes at a critical moment. The hostages cannot wait. Every single day that passes is another day of unimaginable suffering. With every passing moment, their pain deepens, their hope fades and their chances of survival diminish,” she says. “I call on the world to act to bring them home now, not tomorrow, not next week. Now.” The DemocratsÂ	chair Yair Golan blasts the government for “unleashing violence in the West Bank,” after dozens of masked settlers descended on the Palestinian village of Duma earlier today and set fire to several homes. “The pogrom in Duma is not a glitch — it is the result of a deliberate policy,” Golan writes on X. “The government is empowering rioters and unleashing violence in the West Bank, creating a permanent security emergency in order to survive politically.” “The head of the government is a man who is being closed in on by a ring of investigations, a man who has lost his judgment and the public’s trust,” the left-wing politician fumes. “To stay in office, he is pushing for escalation in Judea and Samaria (the Biblical name for the West Bank) — even at the price of the lives of soldiers and civilians.” Israel “must not abandon security to a dangerous government that is fueled by fear,” Golan adds. “Israel needs leadership that understands security, in order to rehabilitate, and bring back security and hope.” US President Donald Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to London says he will ask Britain to reverse a partial suspension of arms exports to Israel, a decision taken over rights concerns. Warren Stephens, an Arkansas-based investment banker and political donor to Trump named for the coveted diplomatic posting, says he is “a little perplexed” by the decision of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. “What I’ve read about that, with the UK halting some of their shipments to Israel, is certainly concerning,” Stephens says at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “I would do my part to encourage them to reinstate those permits and to try to get them, you know, what they need to continue the fight,” he says. His comments come in response to a question from Republican Senator Rick Scott, who said Starmer’s Labour Party “treats Israel as a problem and not a solution” and called on Stephens to “try to educate” Britain on Israel. Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, announced in September that Britain would suspend 30 out of 350 arms export licenses to Israel out of fear the weapons could be used in breach of humanitarian law amid the war in Gaza, sparked by the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led invasion and massacre in southern Israel. Starmer said at the time that the UK still supported “Israel’s right to self-defense” but was “committed to the international rule of law.” The defense attorney for Jonatan Urich — one of the central suspects in the so-called Qatargate scandal — claims during a hearing in the Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court that police investigators attempted to blackmail his client into testifying as a state witness, Hebrew news outlets report. Urich was detained for questioning by police yesterday alongside his colleague Eli Feldstein, a former spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, regarding the pair’s alleged illicit ties to Qatar. The two were brought before the court earlier today as police requested to extend their detention by nine days. Judges granted an extension lasting only until Thursday. According to Urich’s attorney, Amit Hadad, who also represents Netanyahu, the suspect was threatened by police investigators during questioning yesterday. They supposedly pressured Urich into testifying against other suspects in the case, telling him to “think long and hard if he wants to see his baby” that night. Hadad continues, claiming that investigators told Urich: “You know how to deduce one thing from another,” in effect telling him to become a state witness. The investigator in the courtroom denies the accusations and says that “not a word was uttered about [Urich] being a state witness.” She further claims that it was Urich himself who brought up seeing his child that night, rather than police interrogators. Urich and Feldstein are suspected of having been paid to spread pro-Qatar messaging to reporters in order to boost the Gulf state’s image as a mediator in indirect hostage talks between Israel and Hamas, all while in the employ of Netanyahu. A senior police official in the Lahav 433 serious crimes unit told the Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court that the police are concerned over the possibility of obstruction of justice in the Qatargate investigation due to the fact that attorney Amit Hadad, who is representing Jonatan Urich, one of the central suspects in the scandal, is also Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s lawyer. Netanyahu gave testimony as a person with knowledge of the affair on Monday, although it has yet to be decided if he will be questioned by the police under caution, as a suspect. “There is a problem here in that attorney Amit Hadad represents the prime minister, and is also the attorney of one of the suspects here,” says Superintendent Gili Rachlin. “Attorney Hadad was with the prime minister yesterday after we finished the questioning. He knows what he [Netanyahu] said in his testimony. What he was asked. There is, therefore, a significant concern for obstruction of justice,” he continues. Rachlin made his comments following demands by Hadad for the investigators to demonstrate why they were investigating Urich on suspicion of bribery, among other alleged violations of the law. A more junior investigator had been reticent to divulge such evidence in court because Hadad represents both men. Hadad vehemently objected to Rachlin’s concerns and threatened to file a complaint against him, asserting that the claims were baseless. After a group of some 50 Israeli settlers entered the Palestinian West Bank village of Duma earlier this evening, setting fire to property and attacking residents, the military says troops and police officers worked to disperse a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians. In a statement, the IDF says it received reports that dozens of Israelis entered Duma and set fire to property. “Afterward, a violent confrontation developed between Israeli civilians and Palestinians in the area, and additional report was received regarding several Palestinians who were injured in the incident,” the IDF says. It says troops and police officers reached the scene and worked to “disperse the violent confrontation.” “The IDF condemns incidents of this type and will continue to act with determination to maintain security and order in the region,” the military adds. There are no reports of arrests in the incident. Five suspects were briefly caught by police, but defense sources say they managed to escape. #Ø¹Ø§Ø¬Ù	| Ù	Ø³ØªÙ	Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø¶Ø±Ù	Ù	Ù	Ù	 Ø§Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø§Ø± Ù	Ù	Ø¨Ù	Ù	Ù	Øª Ø§Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø§Ø·Ù	Ù	Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø¨Ø¨Ù	Ø¯Ø© Ø¯Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø§ Ø¬Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø¨ Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø¨Ù	In his testimony to police investigators probing the Qatargate case yesterday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he did not know of any connection between his advisers and either Qatar or any representatives of Qatar, Channel 12 reports. Rishon LeZion Magistrate’s Court Judge Menahem Mizrahi, when lifting a gag order on the case earlier today andsumming up key allegations, saidÂ	both Feldstein and Urich allegedly had such connections. The prime minister is not a suspect in the case, and was not questioned under caution. In a video statement after giving his testimony yesterday, Netanyahu said investigators had no actual evidence against Urich and Feldstein, and claimed they were being “held hostage” in a political witch hunt. The Israel Farmers’ Federation lambasts the Finance Ministry’s decision to immediately scrap remaining tariffs on US goods, mainly in agriculture, against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s plans to slap trade partners with tit for tat duties. Amit Yifrach, who chairs the federation and serves as Secretary General of the Moshav Movement, and Uri Dorman, the federation’s secretary general, say in a joint statement, “This is a step that will bring disaster to local agriculture.” They say that “particularly today, after October 7 [2023],” when Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israel, “we must internalize the importance of agriculture to the last furrow and strengthen the farmers who live near the [Gaza] border.” They add, “There is no doubt that trade relations with the US are important and appropriate, but we must ensure that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater, harming food security and national security.” After US President Donald Trump said yesterday â	March 31 â	that he plans to visit Saudi Arabia and other Mideastern countries “next month,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarifies that he was referring to the month of May. “The president will be heading to Saudi Arabia in May. As for specific dates and details, we will be reading those out to you as soon as we possibly can,” Leavitt says during a press briefing. Asked whether ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza will be a prerequisite for his trip, Leavitt says the US continues to work for a ceasefire in Ukraine. She doesn’t say the same thing about Gaza, instead stressing that the US backs Israel. Members of the Abu Samra clan in the Gaza city of Deir al-Balah have executed an individual who they say is a Hamas operative responsible for the deadly shooting of one of their relatives earlier today. The Hamas operative allegedly shot Abdulrahman Sha’aban Abu Samra while he was waiting in line for flour in Deir al-Balah. ð	: Ø§Ù	ØªØ	Ø¸ Ø¹Ù	Ø§ ØªÙ	Ù	 Ø§Ù	Ù…Ù	Ø³Ø§Ù	Ù	Ù	Ø¨Ù	 Ø§Ø¹Ø¯|Ù	Ø« Ø§Ù	Ø§Ù	Ù	 Ù	Ø¨Ù	Ø´Ø§Øª Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯ Ø§Ù	Ø±Ø	Ù	 Ø´Ø¹Ø¨Ø§Ù	 Ø£Ø¨Ù	 Ø³Ù	Ø±Ø© ",April 1: Former IDF Southern Command chief Sami Turgeman said to be in running to lead Shin Bet,ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-04-01T00:58:41,2025-04-01T23:27:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.dw.com/en/top-advisers-to-netanyahu-arrested-in-corruption-case/a-72100829,"Israeli police on Monday said they had arrested two of the closest aides to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Jonatan Urich and Eli Feldstein, on suspicion of illicit ties to the Qatari government. The arrests on Monday mark a development in what local media has dubbed as Qatargate — an investigation probing potential foreign influence, national security breaches and political misconduct. Shortly after the arrests, Netanyahu himself was summoned by police to his office in Jerusalem. He had left his ongoing corruption trial in Tel Aviv earlier in the day to comply with the summons issued by Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, according to Israeli media. Netanyahu is not listed as a suspect in the case. He was questioned as someone with knowledge of the affair, local media reported. The arrests were carried out by Lahav 433, Israel's elite anti-corruption and serious crimes unit, in coordination with domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet. The investigation is operating under a court-imposed gag order until April 10. Allegations at heart of Qatargate case The case centers on allegations that Feldstein, Netanyahu's former spokesperson, worked for an international firm contracted by Qatar while simultaneously employed at the Prime Minister's Office. According to investigators, Feldstein allegedly promoted pro-Qatar narratives to Israeli media while receiving payments from the Gulf state. Feldstein has previously faced charges for leaking classified documents related to hostage negotiations with Hamas. The current investigation expands on those charges, potentially implicating others within Netanyahu's inner circle in a broader scheme involving foreign interference and misuse of government resources. The charges under review reportedly include bribery, breach of trust, money laundering, contact with a foreign agent and national security violations. Israel: Netanyahu calls his corruption trial a 'witch hunt' Netanyahu's Likud party condemns investigation Netanyahu's ruling Likud party has responded with fierce condemnation, calling the arrests politically motivated and part of an orchestrated effort to unseat the prime minister. A statement released by the party on Monday accused the Attorney General's Office and Shin Bet of ""conducting fabricated investigations'' and attempting to ""carry out a coup d'etat through arrest warrants.'' ""This is not an investigation. This is not law enforcement,'' the statement read. ""This is an assassination attempt on democracy.'' Aside from the Qatargate probe, Netanyahu remains on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in unrelated corruption cases The party claimed the arrests were intended to block Netanyahu's efforts to dismiss Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Attorney General Baharav-Miara, both of whom are reportedly under government scrutiny. The Supreme Court has temporarily frozen Bar's removal and will hear the case on April 8. But the opposition has pushed back against Likud's narrative. Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, criticized the ruling bloc's failure to directly deny financial ties between Netanyahu's aides and Qatar. ""The sentence that does not appear in the Likud statement and that should be noted: ‘No one from Benjamin Netanyahu's office received money from Qatar,''' Lapid said in a parliamentary session. Meanwhile, Netanyahu's legal troubles continue on multiple fronts. Aside from the Qatargate probe, he remains on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in unrelated corruption cases. Israelis fear for democracy just as much as for the hostages Why Qatar? Although Israel and Qatar lack formal diplomatic ties, Doha has played a key mediating role in indirect negotiations with Hamas during the ongoing war in Gaza. The Gulf nation's alleged financial links to Netanyahu's aides — particularly during sensitive hostage talks— have raised concerns about national security and foreign influence. Legal experts suggest that if funds from Qatar were indeed funneled to Israeli officials during active negotiations, it could constitute a serious breach of national security laws.

https://apnews.com/article/russia-taliban-afghanistan-terrorism-ban-62230db41231d5607eda9128f1122c69,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s Supreme Court on Monday said it received a petition from the prosecutor general’s office to lift a ban on Afghanistan’s Taliban, who were outlawed two decades ago as a terrorist group. The court said in a statement it would hold a hearing on the petition, submitted by Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov, on April 17. Russia last year adopted a law stipulating that the official terrorist designation of an organization could be suspended by a court. The Taliban were put on Russia’s list of terrorist organizations in 2003. Any contact with such groups is punishable under Russian law. At the same time, Taliban delegations have attended various forums hosted by Moscow. Russian officials have shrugged off questions about the seeming contradiction by emphasizing the need to engage the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan, which the group rules. The former Soviet Union fought a 10-year war in Afghanistan that ended with Moscow withdrawing its troops in 1989. Since then, Moscow has made a diplomatic comeback as a power broker, hosting talks on Afghanistan involving senior representatives of the Taliban and neighboring nations. There is a deepening divide in the international community on how to deal with the Taliban, who have been in power for three years and face no real opposition. Afghanistan’s rulers have pursued bilateral ties with major regional powers. In recent years, the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have removed the Taliban from their lists of terror groups. There are U.N. sanctions on the Taliban.",Russian authorities move to lift the terrorist designation for the Taliban,,AP News,2025-03-31T10:45:54,2025-03-31T12:31:42,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.europeafrica.army.mil/ArticleViewPressRelease/Article/4139490/press-release-three-us-soldiers-found-deceased-after-m88a2-hercules-recovered/,"WIESBADEN, Germany  — Three U.S. Army Soldiers assigned to 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division
c were found deceased in Lithuania today, March 31. The Soldiers, whose identities are being withheld pending notification of next of kin, went missing in the early morning hours of March 25 in their M88A2 Hercules armored recovery vehicle while conducting a mission to repair and tow an immobilized tactical vehicle. Search and recovery operations continue for the remaining fourth Soldier.
U.S. Army units supported by Lithuanian Armed Forces and law enforcement conducted a search in the area and found the Soldiers’ vehicle submerged in a body of water in the early hours of March 26.
The M88A2 was removed from the peat bog early Monday morning, March 31, after a six-day-long effort that required tremendous resources from Lithuania, our steadfast Ally, and hundreds of service members from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, Lithuanian Armed Forces and the Polish Armed Forces—along with other elements from the Lithuanian government and civilian agencies—to solve the engineering challenge of recovering the 63-ton-vehicle from an area surrounded by unstable ground conditions.
“The Soldiers we have lost in this tragedy were not just Soldiers - they were a part of our family. Our hearts are heavy with a sorrow that echoes across the whole Marne Division, both forward and at home,” said Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie, 3rd Inf. Div. commanding general. “We stand in grief with the families and loved ones of these extraordinary ‘Dogface Soldiers’ during this unimaginable time. But the search isn’t finished until everyone is home. Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.”
Lithuanian armed forces provided military helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, unmanned aerial systems, and search and rescue personnel immediately to join the effort, and over the sequence of days brought in excavators, sluice and slurry pumps, other heavy construction equipment, technical experts, and several hundred tons of gravel and earth to enable the recovery.
“Today is a very sad and tragic day. The loss of these Soldiers weighs heavy on me, the hearts of all Task Force Iron service members, and the 3rd Infantry Division. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of these brave Soldiers,” said Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor, commander of Task Force Iron and the 1st Armored Division. “I'd like to personally commend the heroic efforts of the search parties, and especially our Lithuanian allies who were instrumental in the recovery efforts. Their courage and commitment to this operation will always be remembered and demonstrates the strong relationship between our countries. However, search and recovery efforts are not complete - they will continue until we bring all of our Soldiers home.”
U.S. Navy divers assigned to Commander, Task Force 68 assisted the recovery team with finding and accessing two hoist points Sunday evening. They maneuvered through thick layers of mud, clay, and sediment with zero visibility to reach the vehicle and hook steel cables that were attached to two M88A2 Hercules. Partway through the extraction the M88A2s began to lose traction, so several dozers were attached to provide additional grip. It took approximately two hours of winching to remove the M88A2 from the bog.
The dive team has since transitioned to gridding out the area to enable a systematic search and the team is using a ground penetrating radar provided by Lithuanian experts to assist in the ongoing recovery operations. U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania Kara C. McDonald joined U.S. Army Europe and Africa Commander Gen. Christopher Donahue to observe ongoing recovery efforts today near Pabradė.
The Soldiers were deployed to Lithuania in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve, and were permanently stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia.
""The Raider family is heartbroken over the tragic loss of our Soldiers. We are ensuring we provide the needed support to their families and our Soldiers as we go through this grieving process. We are an incredibly tight-knit family, and their absence is keenly felt, and we will hold them close in our memories. I want to extend my personal thanks to everyone who assisted in the search and recovery efforts,” said Col. James Armstrong, 1st Armored Brigade Commander. “The Raider Brigade is incredibly appreciative of all the support we received from our Lithuanian and Polish Allies, and our brothers and sisters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who contributed to helping us recover our Soldiers. We will never forget the dedication, commitment and teamwork that enabled us to recover our Soldiers and provide closure for their families. We are truly stronger together.""
In addition to the support provided at the site, the Archbishop Metropolitan of Vilnius, Gintaras Grušas, led a mass at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Stanislaus and St. Ladislaus of Vilnius, March 30, to pray for the four Soldiers, their families, and those conducting recovery operations. The service was attended by American and German soldiers deployed to Lithuania, Lithuanian soldiers, senior Lithuanian and American officials, and U.S. and NATO military leaders. Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Minister Dovilė Šakalienė, Lithuanian Armed Forces Commander General Raimundas Vaikšnoras, and Ambassador McDonald also attended.
Commander, U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, also attended the service in the Lithuanian capital and later visited the recovery site. “Our sense of partnership drives us forward, and you take care of our Soldiers as if they were your own,” Cavoli told reporters before the mass. NATO also sent assets to assist with recovery efforts.
The U.S. Army and Lithuanian authorities are investigating the cause of the accident. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available.

https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2025/03/31/iran-summons-swiss-envoy-issues-warning-over-trump-s-threats,"Iran’s foreign ministry summoned the Swiss chargé d’affaires in Tehran on Monday over threats made by US President Donald Trump, warning of a decisive response to any hostile action. Switzerland has represented US diplomatic interests in Iran since the two countries severed ties following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. According to the official IRNA news agency, the Swiss envoy was summoned in protest of “continued acts of aggression by [Israel]” and “threats made by the US president.” For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app. The Iranian foreign ministry warned against any hostile actions and reaffirmed Tehran’s “determination to respond swiftly and decisively to any threat,” the agency said. Trump said in a Saturday interview that “there will be bombing” if Iran doesn’t agree to a nuclear deal. “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” he said, according to NBC News, which said he also threatened to punish Iran with what he called “secondary tariffs.” Speaking on Monday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned of a forceful retaliation if the US or its allies bomb the Islamic Republic. “They threaten to do mischief,” Khamenei said of Trump’s latest threat, during a speech on Eid al-Fitr, the holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. “If it is carried out, they will definitely receive a strong counterattack.” On March 7, Trump said he had sent a letter to Khamenei, calling for new nuclear talks and warning of possible military action if Iran refuses. The letter was delivered to Tehran on March 12 by UAE presidential advisor Anwar Gargash. Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters in Iran, has dismissed Trump’s outreach, accusing him of trying to mislead global public opinion by portraying the US as open to talks and Iran as the obstacle. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Thursday that Tehran’s response to Trump’s letter was sent via Oman, which has in the past served as a go-between in the absence of formal US-Iran diplomatic ties. While Iran has ruled out direct talks as long as Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy remains in place, it has signaled openness to indirect negotiations. President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Sunday that Khamenei had permitted indirect talks. The “maximum pressure” policy, reinstated by Trump on his return to the White House in January, saw him reimpose sweeping sanctions on Iran during his first term after abandoning the 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The JCPOA had offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program. Western countries, including the US, have long accused Iran of seeking nuclear weapons – an allegation Tehran denies.

https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-ukraine-war-trump-europe-dcec45198b64234f3a71c8ce805c0065,"BEIJING (AP) — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi traveled to Moscow on Monday for talks with his counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, as Russia and Ukraine discuss U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the 3-year-old war. Wang is scheduled to meet with Lavrov on Tuesday, days after Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after Trump spoke with the two countries’ leaders. It remains to be seen when such a truce might take effect, how long it might last and what targets would be off-limits. Trump lashed out at both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday, expressing frustration with the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. Although Trump insisted to reporters that “we’re making a lot of progress,” he acknowledged that “there’s tremendous hatred” between the two men. He said he was “angry, pissed off” that Putin questioned Zelenskyy’s credibility. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun, in comments consistent with China’s position, emphasized Beijing’s assertions of neutrality in the Ukraine conflict. “We always believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only viable way out of the crisis. China’s cooperation with Russia does not target a third party and should not be affected by any third party,” Guo told reporters at a daily briefing. China did not mention Ukraine in its announcement of Wang’s trip, saying only that the two countries “continue to deepen back-to-back strategic coordination and expand practical cooperation across various fields,” as well as “upholding the basic norms governing international relations.” “The Chinese side is ready to take this visit as an opportunity to work with the Russian side ... on international and regional issues of common concern,” a Foreign Ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying. China has provided strong diplomatic support for Russia in the more than three years since it launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbor, along with an economic lifeline through the trade in energy and consumer goods. However, it has not knowingly provided Russia with weapons or military expertise and has put forward a vague peace plan that was swiftly dismissed by most observers. Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed his unwavering support for Russia’s war in Ukraine during a meeting with a top Russian security official in Pyongyang on Friday. That came after South Korean intelligence assessment in late February that North Korea had likely sent additional troops to Russia after its forces suffered heavy casualties fighting Ukrainian forces.",Chinese official visits Moscow as Russia and Ukraine discuss Trump's proposal to end war,,AP News,2025-03-31T09:04:34,2025-03-31T05:57:28,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-848221,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu officially rescinded the appointment of former naval chief V.-Adm. (ret.) Eli Sharvit to head the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency), his office announced on Tuesday. The prime minister thanked Sharvit for his willingness to take on the role, but informed him that after further consideration he intended to explore other options. Sharvit said, ""I was asked by the Prime Minister to take on the role of head of the Shin Bet and to continue serving the State of Israel at this difficult time - and so I did. This is out of full confidence in the ability of the Shin Bet to meet the complex challenges that have arisen in these days, and a humble belief in my abilities to lead it to this end."" Netanyahu had previously stunned the country twice on Monday, first rolling Sharvit as the new head of the Shin Bet, only to have anonymous aides of his suggest later in the day that the pick might be withdrawn. At press time, it was still not clear whether Netanyahu would stick with Sharvit as his new candidate to run the agency or whether he would opt for another name. Due to a petition to the High Court of Justice, any new appointment will not go into effect before April 8 in any case, and may be further delayed. In initial reactions from Shin Bet sources to The Jerusalem Post, Sharvit was so unknown that most of them had little to say, despite a clear sense of shock that Netanyahu had not only refrained from appointing a deputy Shin Bet chief to the role (which has been customary in recent decades), but that he had taken someone outside of the agency and even outside of IDF ground forces. All hints from Netanyahu spokespeople until Monday had been that the four final candidates for the role were: recent deputy Shin Bet chief ""M"", an earlier deputy Shin Bet chief Yair ""Rolly"" Sagi, former Shin Bet high command official Shalom Ben Hanan, and former Mossad high command official who had also served extensively in the Shin Bet Eyal Tzir Cohen. It was known that Netanyahu was interviewing other candidates, but none of them had been taken seriously by the media and no one had named Sharvit. Netanyahu's choice of Sharvit seemed to be a sign not only that he does not trust the current Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, who the government is trying to fire, but that he also does not trust the top tiers of the agency, and seeks to bring in an outsider disrupter to wrestle greater control over it. However, there is nothing in Sharvit's public record to indicate that he would be an ideological disrupter who would disrespect top Shin Bet officials, other than that he is not close to them since the navy and the agency have little to do with one another. Sharvit served 36 years in the Israeli Navy, including as chief of staff from 2014-2016 and commander from 2016 until 2021. As commander, Sharvit led the development of maritime defense capabilities for Israelâs economic waters and directed complex operational campaigns against Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, the PMO said early Monday. ""The Prime Minister is convinced that Maj. Gen. Sharvit is the right person to lead the Shin Bet forward and uphold the organizationâs proud legacy,"" the PMO added early Monday. However, by Monday afternoon, many Likud and coalition officials, some anonymously and some publicly, were attacking Sharvit. Some attacks related to his participation in protests against the judicial overhaul, while others related to some public criticism he had made of the Trump administration. By later in the afternoon, leading Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham was publicly calling for Netanyahu to drop Sharvit. At the same time, there were some parties on the Left who said that even if he was technically qualified, there was a cloud of suspicion over the fact that he was accepting the role at a time when Netanyahu's firing of Bar was seen as highly controversial. Some legal officials even implied that Netanyahu was using Sharvit to soften potential High Court resistance to firing Bar. It was not clear whether Netanyahu would go back to the original shortlist of four candidates, or opt for some other darkhorse and unknown candidate. The firing of Bar has sparked mass protests across the country, with many considering the move a direct threat to democracy. Netanyahu and Bar have been in a public war of words for the last six weeks since Barâs Shin Bet opened a probe into top aides of the prime minister regarding the scandal known as Qatargate. Qatargate refers to allegations that top Netanyahu aides were paid funds by Qatar in a way that could have impacted their handling of national security matters, including the hostage negotiations with Qatar and Hamas. Netanyahu has also sought to shift blame from himself for failure to stop the October 7 disaster on the Shin Bet and the IDF, seeking Halevi and then Bar's resignations, in order to highlight that blame. High Court Justice Gila Kanfi-Steinitz wrote last week that she âdid not see the needâ to expand a temporary injunction freezing the firing of current head Bar such that it included a prohibition to interview new candidates. This effectively rejected the position of Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara, according to which the prime minister could not take any action that could affect Barâs status, including interviews of new candidates. This means that Netanyahu can name a new agency chief, but that the new candidate cannot take office before the April 8 High Court hearing. The High Court may allow the new candidate to take office, may block his appointment due to Qatargate, or may seek a compromise allowing Bar to conclude theQatargateprobe, while allowing the new candidate to move into office as quickly as possible.",Netanyahu rescinds appointment of new Shin Bet chief																																																																						 after																																																																						 one																																																																						 day,"YONAH JEREMY BOB, MATHILDA HELLER",The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-31T03:04:33,2025-04-01T13:01,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkxm1rg6k1o,"The Red Cross movement has expressed outrage that eight Palestinian medics were killed along with six Civil Defence first responders and a UN staff member by Israeli forces in southern Gaza. Five ambulances, a fire truck and a UN vehicle were struck ""one by one"" in the al-Hashashin area on 23 March, according to a UN official. The 15 bodies were recovered from a ""mass grave"" on Sunday, he said. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said a ninth medic was missing and accused Israel of targeting staff. Israel's military said troops fired on vehicles ""advancing suspiciously"" without headlights or emergency signals. It said a Hamas operative and ""eight other terrorists"" were among those killed. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said in a statement on Sunday that the eight bodies of PRCS medics were retrieved ""after seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen"". The organisation identified those killed as ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan. It added that ambulance officer Assad al-Nassasra was ""still missing"". ""I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians,"" IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said. ""They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. ""Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected."" The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a separate statement that it was ""appalled"" that the medics were killed while carrying out their work. The head of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Gaza, Jonathan Whittall, said in a post on X on Sunday that its staff had supported the PRCS and Civil Defence in recovering the 15 bodies of the PRCS medics, Civil Defence first responders and UN staff member from ""a mass grave... that was marked with the emergency light from one of their crushed ambulances"". In a video that was posted online on Monday, Mr Whittall said: ""Seven days ago, Civil Defence and PRCS ambulances arrived at the scene. One by one they were hit, they were struck. Their bodies were gathered and buried in this mass grave. We're digging them out with uniforms, with their gloves on. They were here to save lives. Instead, they ended up in a mass grave."" ""Their vehicles... are crushed and dumped, covered in sand next to us. It's an absolute horror what has happened here. This should never happen. Healthcare workers should never be a target."" The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said the UN staff member was one of its employees and that the burial of the bodies in ""shallow graves"" was ""a profound violation of human dignity"". The PRCS said it was devastated by the ""massacre of our team"". ""[Israel's] targeting of Red Crescent medics, despite the protected status of their mission and the Red Crescent emblem can only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law,"" a statement added. At the funeral for the medics on Monday, the father of Ashraf Abu Labda told the BBC: ""They [Israeli troops] targeted the first vehicle, then the second and then the third. They killed them in cold blood."" ""We've been trying to look for them for eight days. They refused all co-ordination with Red Crescent, OCHA, or the UN. No-one can hold them accountable. Only God,"" Nasser Abu Labda said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that during an operation in southern Gaza on 23 March ""several vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights, or emergency signals, their movement was not co-ordinated in advance. Thus, IDF troops opened fire at the suspected vehicles.""

https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-republican-headquarters-fire-investigation-8b97dd1b9441d38690d3980ae576d337,"ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) — Federal authorities are investigating a fire early Sunday that damaged the entryway to the headquarters of the Republican Party of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Agents working with local authorities recovered unspecified “incendiary materials” at the scene, said Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokesperson Cody Monday. He declined to say what the materials were or to share further details. The fire follows numerous acts of vandalism in recent weeks directed against Tesla, the electric-car company whose owner, Elon Musk, has led Republican President Donald Trump’s effort to slash the federal workforce. Several of those cases involved Molotov cocktails that were used to start fires at dealerships. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has called it a “wave of domestic terrorism.” Attacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk’s electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. Firefighters responded to the fire just before 6 a.m. and brought it under control within about five minutes, according to Lt. Jason Fejer with Albuquerque Fire Rescue. The building was unoccupied and no one was injured. But the blaze badly burned the entrance and caused extensive smoke damage throughout the office, where three people work full time, according to Fejer and Republican party representatives. A photo provided by GOP representatives showed the charred entrance of the building with wood and pieces of burned insulation scattered on the ground. A broken and burned door was set to one side. The GOP office’s security system detected the fire, said New Mexico Republican Party Chair Amy Barela. She credited firefighters with quickly extinguishing the flames and preventing the fire from spreading. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller called arson a cowardly act. “Politically motivated crimes of any kind are unacceptable, and I am grateful to our fire department for their swift response,” the mayor, a Democrat, said in a statement Sunday afternoon. “This incident is being investigated at the federal level, and I urge anyone with information to report it immediately.” Barela said GOP representatives also found spray paint on the side of the building about 50 feet (15 meters) from the entrance, saying “ICE=KKK.” Monday, the ATF spokesperson, declined to comment on the graffiti. Agents from the FBI also were on the scene investigating, according to Fejer. FBI representatives could not be reached immediately for comment.",Authorities investigate damaging fire at New Mexico's GOP headquarters,,AP News,2025-03-30T16:25:58,2025-03-30T19:46:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-848194,"With hostage talks at an inflection point, the Israel-Hamas War appears to have gone on cruise control, starting on Thursday of last week and lasting through Sunday. There have been continued aerial attacks and limited new ground incursions, but no serious broadening of the invasion has been recorded. Given that there has been little new in the Gaza invasion in the last four to five days, the government appears to have held up a yellow light on the progress of the invasion to allow time for reaching a new hostage deal with Hamas. This has occurred before the IDF dives deeper into other portions of Gaza, forcing most of the population to evacuate to the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone on the Mediterranean coast. The last time the IDF said it killed dozens of Hamas terrorists was Thursday of last week. On both Friday and Sunday, the IDF sent out zero updates on the fighting in Gaza. On Saturday, there was one minor update about an incursion into a less important area of Rafah as well as an update on a series of airstrikes. The last major ground move was on March 26, when the IDF ordered a broad evacuation of Palestinians from northern Gaza, including portions of Zeitoun, Rimal, Tel al-Hawa, and two other areas. Adding these evacuations to earlier ones from Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanun, and Jabalya, most of the northern Gaza areas that are important to Hamas beside the downtown part of Gaza City itself, Shejaia, and Shati, had been evacuated by then. As such, those new ground maneuvers on March 26 were significant. Also, on March 26, the IDF attacked those areas of Gaza that had been responsible for an unidentified impact near Zimrat, a border community by Gaza. Hamas’s rocket fire on March 26 was not successful in terms of killing anyone, but one of the two rockets fired did get through, and the Gazan terrorist groups continue to show the capability to fire two to three rockets at a time.Likewise, on Saturday, the IDF struck areas of Khan Yunis from which mortars had been fired on nearby IDF forces. In the broader view, the most destructive part of renewed hostilities by far was March 18 itself when the air force struck around 80 significant targets, including many top Hamas political officials, in under 10 minutes. What followed was a few days of steady escalation and invasion into different sectors of the Gaza Strip. This seemed to culminate on March 26 and could have broadened further to Gaza City, new parts of Khan Yunis, and new parts of central Gaza, but instead, so far, this has plateaued. Already last week, a forum of high-ranking reservists called on IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir to broaden the invasion and put maximal pressure on Hamas, just as advocates for the remaining hostages pressured the government to cut a new deal with the Gazan terrorist group and halt the latest hostilities. Israel renewed hostilities after a 42-day ceasefire, followed by a nearly three-week deadlock between the sides on the next steps of the ceasefire.","Gaza war in cruise control as Israel, Hamas await hostage deal breakthrough",Yonah Jeremy Bob,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-30T17:43:00,2025-03-30T18:22:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-says-cabinet-voted-to-step-up-military-pressure-on-hamas-in-gaza/,"ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 572 Lazar Berman is The Times of Israel's diplomatic reporter Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said ministers voted overnight to increase military pressure on Hamas, asserting that the methods were â	€œworkingâ	€	 to bring about a deal to free hostages held in the Gaza Strip. â	€œIt works because it acts simultaneously,â	€	 he said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. â	€œOn the one hand, it crushes Hamasâ	€	™s military and governmental capabilities, and on the other hand, it creates the conditions for the release of our hostages.â	€	 The security cabinet last night voted to increase pressure on Hamas, the premier said. The vote was held as massive nationwide protests continued against his governmentâ	€	™s policies on the return of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Elaborating on what he said were three Hamas â	€œfalse claimsâ	€	 about Israelâ	€	™s negotiating posture, Netanyahu said, first, that in contrast to Hamas assertions, Israel is continuing to negotiate, but that it this being done â	€œunder fire,â	€	 which he claimed makes it more effective. â	€œWe see that there are suddenly cracks,â	€	 he said, though Hamas has yet to agree to Israelâ	€	™s demands for a new, extended ceasefire. Media reports on Saturday said Hamas had agreed to an Egyptian proposal to release five living hostages in exchange for a 50-day ceasefire in Gaza. According to multiple media reports, this does not meet the demands of Israel, which is insisting on the return of 10 or 11 living hostages to resume the truce, based on a previous proposal by US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. Israel on Saturday confirmed it had received the proposal from mediating countries and sent a counterproposal â	€œin full coordination with the US.â	€	 Israel is also willing to talk about â	€œthe final stageâ	€	 of a hostage release-ceasefire deal with Hamas, Netanyahu insisted, countering what he called the second Hamas lie about the negotiations. The prime minister had previously refused to enter talks on the second phase of a ceasefire deal reached in January, which would involve discussing the end to the war. Instead, he pushed for an extension of the first phase of the deal. Hamas refused, and Israel renewed intensive military operations throughout Gaza on March 18. â	€œWe are ready,â	€	 Netanyahu said Sunday. â	€œHamas will lay down its weapons. Its leaders will be allowed to leave [Gaza]. We will take care of general security in the Gaza Strip, and enable the implementation of the Trump plan, the voluntary immigration plan.â	€	 â	€œThatâ	€	™s the plan. Weâ	€	™re not hiding it,â	€	 he went on. Israel â	€œis ready to discuss it at any time,â	€	 he said, referring to the US presidentâ	€	™s contentious plan, which triggered global outrage after Trump suggested the US â	€œtake overâ	€	 Gaza and turn it into the â	€œRiviera of the Middle East,â	€	 while forcing its Palestinian inhabitants to relocate to Egypt, Jordan or other countries. The third Hamas lie, according to Netanyahu, was that he doesnâ	€	™t care about the hostages: â	€œThis is what Hamas puts in its propaganda films in order to create division within us,â	€	 he argued. He said that Israel is â	€œcommitted to bringing back the hostages,â	€	 and claimed that the combination of military and diplomatic pressure is the only thing that has worked, and â	€œnot all the empty claims and slogans that I hear in the [TV] studios from the experts.â	€	 The renewal of military operations in Gaza has sparked fears among hostage families that their loved onesâ	€	™ lives will be in increased danger, as some captives were killed in captivity by strikes, or by their captors when troops appeared to be approaching their location. Addressing stepped-up attacks in Lebanon, Netanyahu said that Israel â	€œrespectsâ	€	 Lebanon and its armed forces, â	€œtherefore, we demand from them things that you demand from someone you respect.â	€	 â	€œLebanon is responsible for what comes out of its territory, and it must ensure thatâ	€¦ no attacks against Israel come out of its territory,â	€	 Netanyahu said, apparently referring to recent rocket fire over the past week. He also thanked the US for carrying out strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, calling it â	€œa big change.â	€	 The US on March 15 launched a new campaign of airstrikes against the rebel group after it threatened to resume attacks on â	€œany Israeli vesselâ	€	 in nearby maritime routes as a response to Israel stifling the flow of aid into Gaza. Though former US president Joe Biden also carried out strikes against the Houthis during his term, the campaign was more limited and targeted mostly at launch sites. Under Trump, American fighter jets and drones began bombing high-ranking Houthi personnel and denser city neighborhoods. â	€œWe always value alliances,â	€	 Netanyahu said. â	€œWe have an alliance with the greatest power in the world, and it stands behind us there and in other arenas without reservation, and with the full appreciation of the citizens and the government of Israel.â	€	 Supporting The Times of Israel isnâ	€	™t a transaction for an online service, like subscribing to Netflix.

https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-hungary-icc-arrest-warrant/,"The Israeli prime minister is the target of an arrest warrant charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Hungary on April 2 despite an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), his office reportedly said Sunday. He is expected to meet with his Hungarian counterpart, Viktor Orbán, as well as other high-level Hungarian officials before going back to Israel on April 6. Netanyahu is targeted by an ICC arrest warrant charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. According to Le Monde, Hungary considers it doesn’t have to abide by ICC decisions. The war in Gaza was triggered by the attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when the militant group killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251. Since then, the Israeli offensive has killed more than 50,000 people in Gaza and displaced more than 90 percent of the area’s population. On March 18, a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended when the Israeli armed forces resumed airstrikes and land incursions. The three mediators — Egypt, Qatar and the United States — are working to secure another deal as well as the freeing of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. On Saturday, Hamas said it had accepted a new ceasefire plan proposed by the mediators. Israel, however, has made a counter-proposal. An Israeli strike reportedly killed eight people including five children on Sunday, on the first day of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan.",Netanyahu to travel to Hungary despite ICC arrest warrant,Laura Kayali,POLITICO,2025-03-30T11:30:36,2025-03-30T09:07:15,gemini-2.0-flash

""We don't avoid talks,"" Pezeshkian said in televised remarks during a cabinet meeting. ""Itâ	ms the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far. They must prove that they can build trust.â	"" Pezeshkian was speaking in response to a letter sent by US President Donald Trump to Tehranon 12 March, the exact contents of which were not revealed. Iran's reply, which was delivered to the US through the sultanate of Oman, did however leave the door open for potential indirect negotiations with Washington. The White House did not offer an immediate response to the Iranian president's remarks, but in an interview with NBC that aired on the same day but was recorded just prior to Tehran's comments, Trump said ""If they donâ	 make a deal, there will be bombing and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.""

One prominent example, they said, can be found in Russia’s auto imports from China. These had surged over the past year – as Chinese manufacturers sought a market for their products out of the reach of Western tariffs and trade restrictions – but signs of weakness began to appear in October following Moscow’s increases to vehicle import taxes and recycling fees, as well as the devaluation of the rouble. This trend continued in the first two months of 2025. Chinese customs figures showed that the trade value of passenger cars sent to Russia dropped 48.8 per cent to US$749.9 million year on year, and that of truck shipments plunged 87 per cent to US$40.8 million. Analysts said US President Trump's involvement in negotiating a ceasefire with Ukraine could steer the previously rock-solid relationship between Beijing and the Kremlin in a new direction. “I think the phase of rapid and active growth in trade turnover between China and Russia will indeed be frozen for a while,” said Aleksei Chigadaev, a former visiting lecturer with the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.",Car trouble: is a drop in China-Russia auto shipments a bad omen for trade?,Kandy Wong,South China Morning Post,2025-03-30T04:00:11,2025-03-30T06:14:11,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-848114,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuand Hungarian Prime MinisterViktor Orbán “share a true friendship,” according to Zoltán Kovács, a senior adviser to Orbán and secretary of state for public diplomacy and relations. “There is a strong bond between the two men, and I believe it was long overdue for Mr. Netanyahu to visit Hungary and discuss these important issues,” he toldThe Jerusalem Postin an interview on Wednesday ahead of Netanyahu’s visit to Hungary. This will be Netanyahu’s first visit to Europe since theInternational Criminal Courtissued an arrest warrant for him and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, charging them with war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the Israel-Hamas War. Netanyahu would not be arrested upon arrival, because Hungary will not cooperate with the court on this matter, Kovács said. “The decision itself is outrageous,” he said, adding that it effectively denies Israel’s right to self-defense. “International organizations have been hijacked by the liberal world order, andthe ICCis being used as a political weapon – a witch hunt.” Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Orbán has occasionally taken positions that differ from the European Union’s stance on the war. US President Donald Trump has been working to broker a deal between Russia and Ukraine, and Hungary fully supports his initiative, Kovács said. “We believe that calling for peace and an immediate cessation of hostilities is in Ukraine’s best interest,” he told the Post. “We have been advocating for this approach for nearly three years, right from the very first moment.” In response to criticism that Hungary’s position would compromise Ukraine’s security and allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to benefit from the war, Kovács said: “Hungary is a supporter of Ukraine. Let’s not forget that the largest humanitarian-aid effort Hungary has contributed over the past years has been directed toward Ukraine.” Calling for peace is the “real form of friendship,” because pushing Europe into further wars and sacrificing generations of Ukrainians for a conflict that should never have started was irresponsible behavior, he said. “Pushing integration into areas where it is impossible, certainly by force, will not helpEuropeanintegration,” he added. Even before the Ukraine war, Hungary had tensions with the EU, Kovács said. One of the main points of contention between Hungary and the EU has been the issue of accepting migrants from Syria due to the civil war in the last decade, he said, adding that while the EU opposed Hungary’s decision not to allow migration, many are adopting a similar stance today. “Hungary has advocated for a common-sense, well-established policy on illegal migration: that it should be stopped because it’s dangerous,” Kovács said. “Illegal migration brings in a different culture and mindset, which is causing problems on the streets of Western European cities, and only the blind could fail to see that.”","Netanyahu to travel to Hungary this week, meet with Viktor Orban",AMICHAI STEIN,The Jerusalem Post,2025-03-30T07:32:56,2025-04-02T18:29:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250330000900320?section=national/diplomacy,"SEOUL, March 30 (Yonhap) -- The top trade officials of South Korea, China and Japan on Sunday discussed bolstering trade cooperation among the three countries in their first trilateral ministerial meeting in six years. The 13th Trilateral Economic and Trade Ministers' Meeting among the Republic of Korea, Japan and the People's Republic of China took place in Seoul, involving South Korean Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto. It marked the first time since December 2019 that the industry ministers of the three nations held a trilateral meeting, as well as the first such meeting taking place in Seoul in 10 years. The 2019 meeting was held in Beijing. Sunday's meeting was a follow-up to the summit of the three countries' leaders held in Seoul last year. ""Amid the rapidly changing global economic and trade environment, the meeting of the three countries' trade ministers for the first time in six years carries significant resonance not only for the three nations but also for the international community,"" Ahn said in his opening remarks. He called for efforts to create a ""stable"" environment for global trade by restoring the role of the World Trade Organization. Ahn also urged the three countries to join hands to respond to current issues in the global trade market, such as the rise of new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), digital transformation of economies and supply chain cooperation on critical minerals.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap) In Sunday's meeting, the three ministers agreed to cooperate for the proposed trilateral free trade agreement and advance the regional comprehensive economic partnership (RCEP) amid the expansion of trade protectionism in the global market, according to Seoul's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. RCEP is one of the world's biggest free trade agreements, which South Korea, China and Japan have signed. The 15 member nations of RCEP account for around 30 percent of the global gross domestic product, population and trade volume. Ahn, Wentao and Muto also agreed to boost cooperation on creating a ""predictable"" business environment in the region, and exchanged opinions on measures to stabilize supply chains and export control issues, according to the ministry. The ministry said the three countries also discussed bolstering cooperation for the successful hosting of the Osaka Expo, set to kick off next month in Japan, and the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit to be held in South Korea's southeastern city of Gyeongju in November and in China next year. On the sidelines of the three-way meeting, Ahn was also scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Muto later in the day, following his one-on-one meeting with Wentao on Saturday. nyway@yna.co.kr(END)","Trade chiefs of S.

https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-a3f305c689ebaa46698b5958b09f1b9b,"CAIRO (AP) — The Hamas militant group said Saturday it has accepted a new Gaza ceasefire proposal from mediators Egypt and Qatar, but Israel said it has made a counter-proposal in “full coordination” with the third mediator, the United States. Egypt early in the week made a proposal to get the troubled ceasefire back on track, following Israel’s surprise resumption of fighting. It was not immediately clear whether the proposal changed before Khalil al-Hayyah, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, announced it had been accepted. Early in the week, an Egyptian official described the proposal to The Associated Press, saying Hamas would release five living hostages, including an American-Israeli, from Gaza in return for Israel allowing aid into the territory and a weekslong pause in fighting. Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the closed-door talks. On Saturday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave no details about Israel’s counter-proposal, which it said was offered after Netanyahu held consultations on Friday. Israel a week and a half ago ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people. The White House blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting. Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel also wants Hamas to give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile. On Saturday, Israel widened its ground operations in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Frustrated by the threat to remaining hostages in Gaza, families and others rallied again Saturday evening to call for a deal that would bring everyone home. “The price of your war is the life of the hostages!” some protesters chanted in Tel Aviv. Minor scuffles broke out with police. “War will not bring our hostages home, it will kill them,” Naama Weinberg, cousin of deceased hostage Itay Svirsky, told a weekly gathering of families in Tel Aviv. The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 50,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. Israel’s bombardment and ground operations have caused vast destruction and at their height displaced some 90% of Gaza’s population of over 2 million people. Early this month, Israel again cut off all supplies to Gaza to pressure Hamas to accept new terms to the ceasefire that started in mid-January. Israel had balked at entering negotiations over the truce’s second phase, which were meant to begin in early February. Under the agreement, phase two was meant to bring the release of the remaining 24 living hostages, an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at ",Hamas says it accepts a new Gaza ceasefire proposal but Israel makes a counter-offer,"SAMY MAGDY, JULIA FRANKEL",AP News,2025-03-29T21:00:55,2025-03-29T17:00:55,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/thailand-myanmar-earthquake-latest-rescue-4069e6865c131848968a118644350284,"BANGKOK (AP) — The death toll from Myanmar’s powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake keeps climbing amid rescue efforts. The military government said Saturday that 1,644 people have been killed, with thousands of others injured and dozens missing. Myanmar’s main resistance movement, meanwhile, announced a partial ceasefire to facilitate relief efforts. The earthquake struck midday Friday, followed by several aftershocks, including one that measured 6.4. In Thailand, the quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, leaving 10 people dead. Several countries, including Malaysia, Russia and China have dispatched rescue and relief teams. Here is the latest: Myanmar’s shadow National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military, has announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts. An announcement said that its armed wing, the People’s Defense Force, will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas. It said it would “collaborate with the U.N. and nongovernmental organizations to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,” in the areas it controls. An initial situation report on earthquake relief efforts issued by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that it’s mobilizing with other groups, and $5 million has been allocated from a Central Emergency Response Fund for “life-saving assistance.” “Supply infrastructure and communication towers were severely impacted, electricity and water services were disrupted, including in Yangon Region,” it noted. “Landline, mobile and internet networks remain unstable.” The immediate planned measures include a convoy of 17 cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies from China that is expected to arrive on Sunday, it said. It noted the severe damage or destruction of many health facilities, and warned that a “severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers.” Myanmar’s ruling military said on state television that the confirmed death toll from the 7.7 magnitude earthquake increased to 1,644. The new total is a sharp rise compared to the 1,002 total announced just hours earlier. The number of injured increased to 3,408, while the missing figure rose to 139 from Friday’s quake. Russia has sent a medical team to Myanmar to care for earthquake victims, a Health Ministry official said. According to Alexey Kuznetsov, the medics include specialists in infectious diseases, resuscitation and traumatology. Separately, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry said that two planes carrying Russian rescue workers have landed in Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon. Earlier, the ministry reported that a mission, including search and rescue teams, canine units, anaesthesiologists and psychologists, was on its way to the disaster-stricken country. The ministry said that its rescue teams are equipped with “endoscopes and acoustic devices for searching for people in rubble up to 4.5 meters (nearly 15 feet) deep, as well as ground-penetrating radars and thermal imagers.” Hong Kong sent a group of 51 search-and-rescue personnel to help with earthquake relief efforts in Myanmar. The group includes firefighters and ambulance personnel as well as two search-and-rescue dogs, among others. The group brings along nine tons (18,000 pounds) of equipment including life detectors and masonry cutting machines, as well as an automatic satellite tracking antenna system that provides network connection, according to a statement on the Hong Kong government’s website. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show the earthquake toppled the air traffic control tower at Naypyitaw International Airport. The photos taken Saturday show the tower toppled over as if sheered from its base. Debris lay scattered from the top of the tower, which controlled all air traffic in the capital of Myanmar. It wasn’t immediately clear if there had been any injuries in the collapse, though the tower would have had staff inside of it at the time of the earthquake Friday. It likely also stopped air traffic into the international airport, given all electronics and radar would have been routed into the tower for controllers. Flights carrying rescue teams from China have landed at the airport in Yangon instead of going directly to the airports in the major stricken cities of Mandalay and Naypyitaw. A spokesperson for the China International Development Cooperation Agency said that Beijing will provide Myanmar with 100 million yuan ($13.8 million) in emergency humanitarian aid for earthquake relief efforts. An additional rescue team of 82 people left Bejing, hours after a different team of emergency responders from the Chinese province of Yunnan, bordering Myanmar, arrived in the earthquake-stricken country. Additionally, 16 members of the Chinese civil relief squad Blue Sky Rescue Team in the city of Ruili, Yunnan, departed to Muse City in northern Myanmar to help with relief efforts, according to state broadcaster CGTN. Chinese authorities also sent a first batch of 80 tents and 290 blankets. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping extended condolences to Myanmar’s leader Min Aung Hlaing. The earthquake was felt in parts of China’s Yunnan province, though casualties were limited. Two people in Ruili suffered minor injuries and 847 homes were damaged, according to authorities. Some high-rise buildings and older houses in urban areas were also partially damaged, but power and water supplies and transportation and communications lines have been restored. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters says that his government will support relief efforts “via the International Red Cross Movement.” “Our thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones, and to everyone else affected,” Peters posted on X. South Korea will send the aid through international organizations to support recovery efforts following the recent earthquake. The Foreign Ministry stated on Saturday that Seoul will closely monitor the situation and consider additional support if needed.",The Latest: Countries sending humanitarian aid after Myanmar earthquake,,AP News,2025-03-29T05:44:25,2025-03-29T14:22:53,gemini-2.0-flash

Qassem says Hezbollah is committed to the November 27 ceasefire agreement ending over a year of fighting with Israel and claims that the terror group has no armed fighters south of the Litani River in Lebanon despite Israel maintaining a presence in Lebanon with five strategic posts along the border. The IDF has struck dozens of Hezbollah fighters operating in southern Lebanon since the ceasefire, accusing the terror group of violating the deal. Qassem adds that Hezbollah will not accept normalization between Israel and Lebanon, which he says is a desire of Jerusalem. He also says that if Israel does not commit to the ceasefire, Hezbollah will have no choice but to return to “other options.” In the past week, there were two incidents in which rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory amid the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza. On Friday, the IDF attacked Beirut for the first time since the ceasefire on the northern front took effect. Hezbollah denied any connection to the two incidents.

Separately, dozens of airstrikes were carried out over the weekend, targeting what the military says were Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad infrastructure. The targets included weapon depots, rocket launchers, and buildings used by the terror groups, according to the IDF.

According to the report, US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander would be released under the potential deal, with the United States and Qatar intensively involved in the proposal.

Sources familiar with the negotiations earlier told Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar outlet that the Egyptian proposal includes “a temporary ceasefire lasting approximately 50 days, in exchange for the release of five Israeli [hostages] and a number of Palestinian prisoners, along with the activation of a mechanism for the entry of sufficient quantities of aid [into Gaza], including food, medical supplies, and basic necessities for civilian relief.” Supporting The Times of Israel isn’t a transaction for an online service, like subscribing to Netflix.

The main protest by the coalition of protest groups will begin at 6:30 p.m. at Tel Aviv’s Habima Square. At the conclusion of the demonstration, protesters will march to Begin Street to join the group of hostage families who rally there. Separately, the rally at Hostages Square will be addressed by freed hostage Iair Horn, whose brother Eitan Horn is still held in Gaza; 				Eli Shtivi, the father of Idan Shtivi; Bar Godard, the daughter of Manny Godard; Einav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker; Major General (Ret.) Yom-Tov Samia; and actor Michael Rapaport. Rallies calling for the return of the hostages will also take place throughout the country, including in Jerusalem, Carmei Gat and at the Sha’ar HaNegev Junction. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum says in a statement that relatives of those held in Gaza are “urging all Israelis, from every background and political viewpoint” to attend the protests. The protests will be held against the backdrop of the government’s passage of key judicial overhaul legislation and an ongoing impasse in the hostage negotiations amid the resumption of fighting in Gaza, as well as the firing of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and the advancement of the dismissal of Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. A poll aired yesterday by Channel 12 showed 69 percent of Israelis support ending the war in exchange for a deal that releases all remaining hostages in Gaza, compared to 21% who oppose such an agreement. Even among coalition voters, a majority (54%) back such a move compared to 32% who oppose it.","Tens of thousands expected to rally Saturday night against judicial overhaul, in favor of hostage deal",ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-03-29T08:20:55,2025-03-29T08:20:55,gemini-2.0-flash

Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Wentao, held a bilateral meeting in Seoul ahead of the trilateral meeting of industry ministers of South Korea, China and Japan, scheduled for the following day, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. The previous meeting of the two countries' industry ministers was held in San Francisco in November 2023. In the latest meeting, the two sides agreed to continue bilateral cooperation in trade under the multilateral trading systems of the World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) amid heightened global tensions sparked by major economies' protectionist policies, according to the ministry. Ahn and Wentao also discussed expanding cooperation in supply chains of critical minerals, which are essential for advanced industries, such as battery and semiconductor. The two sides also agreed to cooperate for the successful hosting of the upcoming APEC summit to be held in South Korea this year and in China next year, the ministry said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgdgxql6vpo,"Four people have been killed and another 21 injured in a mass Russian drone attack on the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, the area's regional head has said. Serhiy Lysak said a restaurant complex and several residential buildings were ablaze after the attack late on Friday. He added that ""the enemy sent more than 20 drones"" to the city, and that ""most of them were shot down"". Images and videos later emerged showing firefighters tackling large fires that had engulfed the buildings that were struck, and smashed glass and other debris scattered on the city streets. Overnight, air sirens were heard sounding in several other Ukrainian regions, including the capital, Kyiv. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the military administration in Zelensky's home city Kryvyi Rih, also confirmed on Telegram that there was a ballistic missile attack on the central city on Saturday morning, and that so far five people had been wounded. High-rise buildings and private houses, a school, a car wash were damaged in the strike, he said. Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said three Ukrainian drones were either intercepted or shot down over the western Belgorod region. In his video address late on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky again accused Russia of targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure - in violation of a temporary moratorium agreed earlier this month in talks involving the US. Moscow has also repeatedly blamed Ukraine for attacking Russia's energy sector. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested earlier this week that Ukraine should temporarily be placed under UN control to elect what he called a more ""competent"" government. It was seen as the latest attempt by the Kremlin to challenge the legitimacy of the Kyiv government - a move widely condemned by Ukraine's allies. Ukraine accused Putin of proposing ""crazy"" ideas to delay further movement towards a ceasefire deal being championed by US President Donald Trump. Washington said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a limited truce in the Black Sea. But Russia then put forward a list of conditions, including the lifting of some Western sanctions, prompting concerns that Moscow was trying to derail any moves towards a ceasefire. In a separate development, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that France and the UK were moving forward with plans for a ""reassurance force"" in Ukraine. The proposal was discussed at a summit of the ""coalition of the willing"" - Ukraine's allies from more than 30 countries - in Paris. Russia has repeatedly warned that the deployment of any European troops in Ukraine would be unacceptable, and such forces would be seen by the Kremlin as a legitimate target. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.","Four killed in mass Russian drone attack on Dnipro, Ukraine says",Jaroslav Lukiv,BBC News,2025-03-29T00:02:47,2025-03-29T07:13:48,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/un-south-sudan-guterres-war-kiir-machar-c308bca7e16a34c11be2bc75c2f910ea,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations chief urged regional and international leaders Friday to prevent South Sudan from falling “over the abyss” into another civil war and speak with one voice to support a return to peace. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world’s newest and one of its poorest countries is facing “a security emergency” with intensifying clashes and a “political upheaval” culminating with this week’s arrest by the government of First Vice President Riek Machar. “Meanwhile, ethnic and political targeting by security forces — coupled with the spread of misinformation on social media — is lighting the fuse for even worse,” he warned. “Let’s not mince words: What we are seeing is darkly reminiscent of the 2013 and 2016 civil wars, which killed 400,000 people.” The civil wars ended in a 2018 peace agreement that brought President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and Machar, an ethnic Nuer, together in a unity government, which is supposed to be heading toward delayed national elections in December 2026. But tensions have been increasing between Kiir’s and Machar’s parties, and they escalated in March when the White Army, an armed group loyal to Machar, overran an army base in Upper Nile state and attacked a U.N. helicopter. The government responded with deadly airstrikes. Guterres urged South Sudan’s leaders to “end the politics of confrontation,” restore the national unity government, and release detained military and civilian officials now. “I also urge the regional and international community, as guarantors of the (2018) peace agreement, to speak with one voice in support of the peace process and against any attempts to undermine it,” he said. Guterres said he spoke to the chair of the African Union Commission on Friday morning and announced the U.N.’s support for the deployment of the AU’s five-member Panel of the Wise and the special envoy of Kenya’s President William Ruto to South Sudan’s capital, Juba, to pursue a diplomatic solution. The U.N. chief said the Panel of the Wise and Kenyan envoy Raila Odinga will visit both Kiir and Machar. Odinga, a former prime minister of Kenya, was in Juba on Friday. But it was not immediately clear if he was able to meet with Machar. South Sudan’s Information Minister Michael Makuei said in a statement Friday that Machar was under house arrest pending an investigation into subversive activities. Machar was arrested to maintain stability and prevent the country from sliding back into conflict, he said, adding that the 2018 peace agreement with Machar remains in place. “The agreement has not collapsed,” Makuei said. But Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, deputy chairperson of the country’s main opposition party led by Machar, said Thursday the 2018 agreement “has been abrogated.” He said Machar’s arrest shows a lack of political goodwill to achieve peace and stability. Guterres stressed that the United Nations wants to see the visits by Odinga and the AU’s Panel of the Wise produce “the effect we want.” “And the effect we want is the re-establishment of the peace agreement and the creation of conditions for peace in South Sudan,” he said. ___ Associated Press reporter Deng Machol in Juba, South Sudan, contributed to this report.",UN chief says world leaders must speak with one voice to prevent a new civil war in South Sudan,Edith M.

https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-and-vietnam-forge-new-trade-path-with-planes-and-beef/,"Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met Vietnamese President Luong Cuong in Hanoi on March 28, 2025, sparking talks on aviation and beef exports. The leaders aim to boost ties, with Brazil eyeing Vietnam as a key Southeast Asian partner. This visit, Lula’s second to Vietnam, signals a pragmatic push for economic gains. Lula pitches Embraer jets to Vietnam Airlines, targeting a deal for ten E190 planes worth millions. Vietnam’s booming aviation market drives demand, and Brazil seeks a slice of this growth. Meanwhile, Lula nudges Vietnam to import Brazilian beef, promising jobs and a processing hub via JBS’s potential $50 million plant. Trade figures tell a bigger story: Brazil-Vietnam commerce hit $5 billion in 2023, fueled by soybeans and electronics. Vietnam, facing U.S. pressure over its trade surplus, diversifies imports, balancing relations with Brazil’s agricultural might. Lula also invites Vietnam to the BRICS summit Brazil hosts in July 2025, eyeing broader influence. Brazil and Vietnam Forge Strategic Trade Ties Amid Global Shifts The leaders sign a five-year plan covering defense, energy, and coffee—two nations leading global supply. Climate change threatens their crops, so they swap farming know-how. Lula pushes a Mercosur-Vietnam trade deal, leveraging Brazil’s bloc presidency later this year for mutual wins. Vietnam weighs its options as a manufacturing star, dubbed a “Tiger Cub” since opening up in 1989. Brazil, a beef and plane powerhouse, exports $8 billion in meat yearly and sees Vietnam as an Asian gateway. Both navigate global shifts, from Trump’s trade demands to net-zero goals by 2050. Challenges linger: Vietnam’s rules slow beef entry, and Embraer faces Boeing’s shadow. Yet, success could reshape trade flows, with Vietnam as Brazil’s launchpad into Asia. The story behind the numbers reveals two emerging players aligning for practical, not flashy, gains in a tense world. Copyright © 2025 The Rio Times All Right Reserved Forgot your password?

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-top-prosecutor-suspends-bulgarian-prosecutor-colleague-amid-probe/,"The European Public Prosecutor’s Officehas temporarily suspended its Bulgarian prosecutor Teodora Georgieva, who is the subject of an investigation into potential misconduct. Announced on Thursday, it’s the first suspension and internal investigation into allegations of misconduct by a prosecutor in EPPO’s four years of existence. Tasked with investigating serious fraud in the European Union, the office’s independence is essential to its function and reputation. The move comes amid broader concerns about attemptsby Bulgarian officials to impede EPPO’s high-profile investigations. “As the strongest measure available against any risk or perception of compromised integrity of investigations, the supervising Bulgarian European Prosecutor has been temporarily suspended,” an EPPO statement read. European Chief Prosecutor Laura Kövesi
said her officelaunchedan administrative inquiry into potential misconduct by Georgieva days after Bulgarian media reported on apparent links between the magistrate and an alleged criminal. Asked to comment on the matter, EPPO declined. Georgievaclaimsshe was pressured in a campaign related to a high-profile investigation into the Bulgarian state-owned gas storage expansion facility, Chiren. SheaccusedDelyan Peevski, a member of Bulgarian parliament, of threatening to stop her from indicting a former energy minister involved in the Chiren project. “They are threatening me, and successfully. I feel threatened by Peevski. First there was the fire in the family house, in which my mother died,” Georgieva told Bulgarian television channel bTV. After her motherdiedin the fire, which is being investigated as a potential arson, EPPO in recent weeks provided Georgieva with additional protection. Reacting to the bTV statements, PeevskiallegedGeorgieva was lying and called on EPPO to respond. The United Statesandthe United Kingdomhave sanctioned Peevski for “perpetuating corruption in Bulgaria.” The Sofia city prosecutor’s office in 2023initiatedan anti-corruption check on Georgieva that, according to local mediaCapital, did not turn up evidence of a crime.

https://apnews.com/article/xi-business-economy-foreign-investment-4c65118536089f361f1ecd060e0dca96,"BEIJING (AP) — In an address to major global business leaders, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged foreign investors to have faith in China’s business prospects, the latest move to revive the world’s second-largest economy that has been dragged down by a property bust and a loss of momentum. “China has always been and will certainly be an ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors,” Xi told executives, including Akio Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, Lee Jae-yong, chairman of Samsung Electronics and Stephen Allen Schwarzman, CEO of investment firm Blackstone. China remains a major exporter of products to countries around the world and boasts a domestic market of 1.4 billion people. However, massive overbuilding in the property sector has tied up trillions of dollars in capital, sapping business and consumer confidence and depriving the economy of its past vitality, while a tariff war unleashed by the U.S. is compounding those problems. Private businesses, which provide a large share of growth and jobs in the country’s state-dominated economy, have borne much of the burden after years of regulatory crackdowns have shaken the confidence of entrepreneurs and other investors. China’s unprecedentedly tough response to the COVID-19 outbreak also shut down business for much of three years and some sectors of the economy have yet to recover, particularly where global supply chains are involved. Yet, Xi, considered something a sceptic when it comes to inviting in overseas businesses, said foreign investors could have confidence that “the door of opening up will only open wider and wider. The policy of utilizing foreign investment has not changed and will not change,” he said. “China contains huge investment and consumption potential,” he added. China has set an economic growth target of about 5% for this year, the same as last year and a level that analysts said would be difficult to achieve. The government has said it would attempt to stimulate the roughly $20 trillion economy by borrowing more money for a slew of initiatives, such as giving 300 billion yuan ($41.3 billion) in rebates to consumers who trade in old cars and appliances for new ones. But much of the borrowing will go to supporting the housing market and local governments weighed down by debt. What is clear is that a trade war with the United States has left the outlook for the coming months uncertain. Trump has raised tariffs on imports from China twice since taking office in January, leaving them at 20% across-the-board. China has shown no sign of backing down, retaliating with tariffs on U.S. goods. Xi did not mention the tariffs directly, but appeared to be referring to the importance of stable trade terms by saying: “Blowing out other people’s lights will not make your own lights brighter. Blocking other people’s paths will eventually block your own paths.” For now, however, China is seeking to portray itself as “an ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors,” he said. “Going with China is going with opportunities. Believing in China is believing in tomorrow. Investing in China is investing in the future,” the president, who has made himself leader for life and also heads the ruling Communist Party, said. Others in attendance Friday included Amin H. Nasser, president of Saudi Aramco; Sherard Louis Cowper-Coles, the chair of China-Britain Business Council; Oliver Zipse, BMW CEO and Ray Dalio, chief investment officer of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.",China's Xi makes strong push for greater foreign investment as economy continues to lag,,AP News,2025-03-28T07:51:04,2025-03-28T03:51:04,gemini-2.0-flash

“Half of the world is dreaming about our ‘dictatorship,’ the dictatorship of real business and interests of our people,” Lukashenko, 70, said in his inauguration speech at the Independence Palace in the capital of Minsk.

Hundreds of opposition supporters living abroad held anti-Lukashenko rallies Tuesday to mark the anniversary of Belarus’ short-lived independence in 1918 following the collapse of the Russian Empire.

Lukashenko marked three decades in power last year, and his political opponents have denounced the tightly orchestrated Jan. 26 election as a farce. The Belarus Central Election Commission declared he won with nearly 87% of the vote after a campaign in which four token challengers on the ballot all praised his rule.

Opposition members have been imprisoned or exiled abroad by Lukashenko’s unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech.

Months of massive protests that were unprecedented in the history of the country of 9 million people followed the 2020 election and brought on the harsh crackdown. Over 65,000 people were arrested, thousands were beaten by police and independent media outlets and nongovernmental organizations were closed and outlawed, bringing condemnation and sanctions from the West.



Thousands of Lukashenko supporters attended Tuesday’s inauguration ceremony, where he denounced his critics as foreign stooges who were at odds with the people.

“You don’t and won’t have public support, you have no future,” he declared. “We have more democracy than those who cast themselves as its models.”

Belarusian activists say it holds more than 1,200 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Center.

“The election was held amid a deep human rights crisis, in the atmosphere of total fear caused by repressions against civil society, independent media, opposition and dissent,” according to a statement released Tuesday by Viasna and 10 other Belarusian human rights groups. They said Lukashenko’s hold on power is illegitimate.

Lukashenko has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, relying on subsidies and political support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself in office for a quarter-century, an alliance that helped the Belarusian leader survive the 2020 protests.

Lukashenko allowed Moscow to use the country’s territory to invade Ukraine in February 2022 and later hosted some of Russia’s tactical nuclear weapons.

Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus under government pressure after running against Lukashenko in 2020, vowed to keep fighting for the country’s freedom.

“Our goal is to break away from the Russian occupation and Lukashenko’s tyranny, and to return Belarus into the European family of nations,” Tsikhanouskaya said in a speech at the Lithuanian parliament,

Some observers say Lukashenko could now try to mend ties with the West.

Lukashenko already has been sending signals to the West about his readiness to start a dialogue and his desire to normalize ties in order to ease the total dependence on the Kremlin and soften Western sanctions during his seventh term,” said Valery Karbalevich, an independent political analyst.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78e2x7lz25o,"Western sanctions on Russia need to be increased, not weakened, in order to bring it to the negotiating table, Sir Keir Starmer has said. The prime minister accused Vladimir Putin of ""playing games and playing for time"" after the Russian president demanded sanctions were lifted before a US-brokered maritime ceasefire is enacted. ""Now is not the time for pulling back or weakening sanctions - now is the time to increase sanctions to get them to the table,"" Starmer said in Paris, where he is meeting European leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron, co-hosting Thursday's so-called ""coalition of the willing"" summit, has suggested a European reassurance force could ""respond"" if attacked by Moscow. Starmer said on Thursday a ""framework and a deadline"" was needed for Ukraine peace talks. He said he had agreed with partners at the summit, which hosted representatives from 30 nations as well as the European Union and Nato, that ""we must go further now to support the peace process, support Ukraine and increase the pressure on Russia to get serious"". ""It means increasing the economic pressure on Russia, accelerating new tougher sanctions, bearing down on Russia's energy revenues, and working together to make this pressure count,"" he said. Starmer said that the political mood to find a just and lasting peace in Ukraine was ""stronger and broader"" than it had ever been, adding that ""Europe as a whole has not been this strong and united in a long time"". The UK will chair the next meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact group, comprised of dozens of countries, to deliver further military aid and ""keep Ukraine in the fight"", Starmer said. The prime minister said defence chiefs from the UK, France and Germany would also be meeting in Ukraine, but did not specify a date. Speaking with Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier, Starmer accused Russia of ""continuing to inflict devastating attacks on the Ukrainian people"" and said Putin's promises were ""hollow"". Zelensky said that everybody at the meeting understood ""that Russia doesn't want any kind of peace"" and was ""dragging out the war, adding that they would discuss security guarantees in the coming weeks and days. In a post on X, the Ukrainian leader thanked the UK and France for their support and shared a picture of himself and Starmer holding talks, describing the plans as a ""coalition of strength for the sake of peace"". ""Our unity and joint work in Europe, with the United States, and other partners, can force Russia into peace,"" Zelensky added. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking the terms of a separate, tentative deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure. Washington announced the Black Sea deal had been agreed on Tuesday, after holding separate talks with delegations from Ukraine and Russia in Saudi Arabia. But just hours later, the Kremlin said it would not take effect until sanctions were lifted on Russian banks, producers and exporters involved in the international food and fertiliser trades. Moscow's demands include reconnecting Russian banks involved in the agrifood trade to the Swift payment system, lifting restrictions on servicing ships under the Russian flag involved in the food trade, and revoking sanctions on the supply of agricultural machinery and other goods involved in food production. US President Donald Trump said the US government was ""looking at"" Moscow's request - but the EU said it would not consider removing sanctions before the ""unconditional"" withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's internationally-recognised territory. Zelensky said on Wednesday he hoped the US - which is not a part of the coalition of the willing - would ""stand strong""in the face of Russian demands. Macron confirmed that European countries had ""unanimously agreed"" that sanctions against Moscow should not be lifted. ""The time is not ripe to lift sanctions... We need to keep economic pressure up,"" he said. The French president said that if a European force protecting a ceasefire in Ukraine came under attack, it would ""respond to it"". ""If there was again a generalised aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would be under attack, and then it's our usual framework of engagement,"" he said. ""Our soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it."" The UK and France are leading efforts to send a force to Ukraine to deter any future Russian aggression in the event of a ceasefire. Starmer reiterated on Thursday that Parliament should have a say on deploying troops. European leaders put on a show of unity in Paris. In reality many have already ruled out sending troops to Ukraine. Countries including Finland and Poland feel under direct threat from Russia and feel their troops need to protect their own borders. Others fear deploying soldiers would be a deeply unpopular decision at home. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – who has repeatedly expressed her scepticism at the Franco-British plan – has been working to put forward an ""alternative"" option which would see soldiers serve in Ukraine exclusively as part of a United Nations military contingent. European officials say that under any peace settlement, Ukraine's first line of defence against any future Russian attack would be its own army. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said a European force in Ukraine would risk a ""direct clash between Russia and Nato"", state-owned news agency Tass reports. ""London and Paris continue to nurture the idea of a military intervention into Ukraine. All of that is being cloaked under [the guise of] a certain peacekeeping mission,"" Zakharova said. She added Russia was ""categorically against such a scenario"".",Starmer says sanctions should increase on Russia to secure Ukraine peace,James Gregory and Laura Gozzi,BBC News,2025-03-27T05:38:54,2025-03-27T23:04:01,gemini-2.0-flash

Hundreds of participants then joined hostage Matan Zangauker’s mother, Einav, in marching to the nearby Begin Gate. Police officers — some on horseback — sought to prevent demonstrators from blocking the road, leading to a clash that saw several protesters thrown to the ground. Seven protesters were arrested, according to Hebrew media reports. Addressing the earlier Habimah protest, former IDF general Noam Tibon asserted that the IDF’s renewed military operations are endangering the hostages. “But the October 7 government doesn’t care about this. They are busy toasting the passage of their budget,” Tibon said. Former police chief Roni Alsheich told the crowd that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting against the national interest and called on fellow members of the national religious camp to speak out against the premier and his government. The protest was held against the backdrop of the government’s passage of key judicial overhaul legislation and an ongoing impasse in the hostage negotiations.

https://buenosairesherald.com/economics/caputo-confirms-us20-billion-deal-between-argentina-and-imf,"Economy Minister Luis Caputo has confirmed that the Argentine government has reached an agreement with the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a US$20 billion loan. The agreement must now be approved by the Fund’s board of directors. IMF spokeswoman Julie Kozack did not give a figure during a Thursday press conference but described the deal as “sizable.”  “What I can say now is that discussions on a new Fund-supported program are very advanced. And those discussions include discussions around a sizable financing package,” she said, but underscored that the final decision over the deal amount would fall to the IMF board. Regarding the payment schedule, she said: “As with all of our programs, disbursements will come in tranches over the life of the program. But the exact phasing and the size of each tranche is also, of course, part of the discussions that are underway.” Caputo spoke about the deal during an insurance conference on Thursday morning. “The sum we’ve agreed on, that the staff will submit for the board’s approval, is US$20 billion,” he said. “As you can see, it’s much higher than the amount that was rumored.” The minister said the IMF did not place the usual fiscal, monetary, and reserve conditions on the deal. He did not specify whether the government’s current 1% monthly crawling peg — the rate at which it devalues the peso against the dollar — would remain in place. President Javier Milei also spoke following Caputo’s announcement. In an interview, he said that IMF Managing Director Kristalina Giorgieva authorized the minister to disclose the amount of the loan last night. Milei also emphatically ruled out the possibility of a devaluation, which market sources take for granted. He said that, after the new loan, there will be “a lack of pesos, not a lack of dollars.” Kozack said that the parties were in ongoing discussions over what policies would be covered by the program but added: “To sustain the gains that have been achieved so far by the authorities, there is a shared recognition about the need to continue to adopt a consistent set of fiscal, monetary, and foreign exchange policies while fostering further and furthering growth-enhancing reforms.” Additional packages Caputo also said that the government is negotiating an additional package with the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (also known as CAF) “to strengthen the Central Bank’s reserves.” Gross reserves, according to Caputo, will increase to US$50 billion thanks to these loans. The monetary base, he said, currently sits at US$25 billion at the official exchange rate and at US$20 billion at the blue-chip swap dollar rate. “We will have double the amount of reserves than the current monetary base.” “Although I can’t give you any more details of the rest of the agreement due to confidentiality clauses, I thought it was important to tell you about the amount,” Caputo said. “Our goal is that, in the future, we can get access to markets again and that Argentina can at least refinance the capital in such a way that reserves continue to back pesos in the Central Bank.” He continued: “Not only is it different from the over 20 previous deals Argentina has had with the IMF, but it is also different from any other deal the IMF has reached with other countries.” Caputo explained that while IMF deals typically consist of the lender making gradual disbursements while demanding fiscal and monetary adjustments to put the country’s economy “in order,” this is not the case for Argentina’s new agreement. “We’ve already carried out those fiscal and monetary adjustments,” he said. After Milei took office in December 2023, the new administration evaluated the possibility of seeking a new loan from the IMF, “which wouldn’t have happened because the Fund would not commit more capital without seeing concrete results,” Caputo said.  Another option was continuing the program from former President Alberto Fernández’s government. “If we focused on the goals fixed for the prior government, we couldn’t have stopped the crisis from happening. It wouldn’t have been enough to stop hyperinflation,” the minister added. In this scenario, Milei’s government decided to take on “much more challenging goals” and refrain from borrowing more money until the IMF was “convinced” that the administration would be able to comply with those goals. “That’s what we did. We ended the fiscal deficit in a month and ended monetary emission in six months,” Caputo said.",Caputo confirms US$20 billion deal between Argentina and IMF staff,Buenos Aires Herald,Buenos Aires Herald,2025-03-27T13:11:39,2025-03-27T19:33:04,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/wildfires/wildfires-continue-rage-carolinas-rcna198328,"The Table Rock wildfire burning in South Carolina continued to grow Thursday, but conditions that created dramatic expansion the day before eased, officials said. The fire, which was started March 21 by hikers, had burned an estimated 8,679 acres by 4:30 p.m. Thursday when a flight captured infrared data, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said. Hundreds of residents in North Carolina and South Carolina have been ordered to leave and structures have been destroyed in the fires, which are burning amid abnormally dry or drought conditions in both states. Downed timber left in the wake of Hurricane Helene, a devastating storm that struck in September, has also been fueling the fires' spread, officials have said. “The amount of downed debris and timber in the woods is almost indescribable,” Madeline Stewart, the South Carolina Forestry Commission Public Information Coordinator, said on NBC’s “TODAY” show. North Carolina fires In North Carolina, there are eight active wildfires in Caldwell, Buncombe, Polk, Jackson, Haywood and Swain counties, according to an interactive map by the North Carolina Forest Service. New fires sparked in dry conditions Wednesday, prompting Gov. Josh Stein to declare another state of emergency “to make sure we have every tool at our disposal” to respond to fires in the western part of the state. The worst blazes are the Black Cove Complex Fire and the Deep Woods Fire, both in Polk County and Henderson County. The Black Cove Complex fire has burned around 3,288 acres and was 17% contained Thursday evening, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture said in an update. The fire first ignited March 19 by a downed power line. ""Fire behavior has continued to be intense, with rapid fire spread and extreme burning conditions due to high winds and dry weather,"" the department said. But on the Deep Woods Fire, there was better news Thursday. There was progress on containment of that fire, which has burned an estimated 3,373 acres in size and was 30% contained by that evening, the department said. It was first reported March 19 and the cause is under investigation. A third fire that had prompted evacuation orders, the Fish Hook Fire, was 199 acres in size and 95% contained. Evacuation orders had previously been lifted. South Carolina fires In South Carolina, the Table Rock Fire and the Persimmon Ridge Fire were the two major wildfires in the state. The Persimmon Ridge Fire ""saw only modest expansion"" Thursday as conditions were milder than what was seen Wednesday, state officials said. The fire grew to 1,992 acres Thursday, but the state forestry department said most of that growth was from ""burnouts"" created by firefighters between existing fire breaks. The Table Rock Fire was started by “the negligent act of some hikers,"" the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office said last week. “The young men that are responsible for the fire have been identified. The investigation is continuing by agents and detectives with the sheriff’s office as well as those with the South Carolina Forestry Commission, and the appropriate charges will be discussed and made at a later date,” Sheriff Tommy Blankenship said in a March 21 statement. On Wednesday, the South Carolina Forestry commission called for the immediate evacuations of residents in Greenville and Pickens counties. “Never in my 52 years did I think would I be running from my home in a fire,” said Wendy Clarke, who evacuated her home in the Caesar's Head area near the Persimmon Ridge Fire to a local shelter.","Hurricane Helene aftermath fuels Carolina fires, prompting new warnings and evacuations","Marlene Lenthang, Phil Helsel",NBC News,2025-03-27T13:54:41.990Z,2025-03-27T23:45:36.699Z,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-france-macron-zelenskyy-coalition-willing-8f6f3e0afdfbdaa08a00d289c206bf4f,"PARIS (AP) — France and Britain will continue to forge ahead with plans to deploy troops in Ukraineto defend an eventual peace deal with Russia but only some other nations want to take part,French President Emmanuel Macronsaid Thursday after a summit of countries that have been mulling the proposal. The French leader said “several” nations other than France and Britain want to be part of the armed force but added, “It is not unanimous.” Paris and London say such a force would aim to secure any peace deal by dissuading Russia from attacking Ukraine again. “We do not need unanimity to achieve it,” Macron said. French and British military officials will work with Ukraine to determine where the contingents should be deployed and how many troops they’d need to be a credible deterrent, the French leader added. “There will be a reassurance force with several European nations that will deploy,” he insisted. The summit of leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs came at a crucial juncture in themore than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven bypressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. But fighting rages on. Before the leaders met in the luxury of the French presidential palace, Russian drone attacks overnight wounded more than 20 people and heavy shelling Thursday afternoon killed one person and knocked out electricity in parts of Kherson, Ukrainian officials said. Macron and other summit participants accused Russia of only pretending to want a negotiated settlement. “They are playing games and they’re playing for time,” said U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. “We can’t let them drag this out while they continue prosecuting their illegal invasion.” U.S.-brokered agreements this weekto safeguard shipping in the Black Seaand last week to haltlong-range strikes on energy infrastructurewere greeted as first steps toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of deal violations, foreshadowing a long and contentious process ahead. One reason why some European countries are balking at a potential deployment in Ukraine is because it’s unclear whether Trump would support such a contingent with air power and other military assistance. “This will require the engagement and support of the United States,” Starmer said. “That’s a discussion we’ve had with the president on many occasions.” Macron suggested they may have to do without U.S. backing. “You have to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst,” he said. “My hope is that the Americans will be on our side and that the Americans will support, even play an active role.” “But we have to be prepared for a situation where perhaps they won’t join in,” he added. Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent — U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops — would be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War butare now rearming. Starmer’s office said military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details, examining “the full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.” Greece publicly rejected sending troops. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said those discussions were “somewhat divisive” and distracted from the goal of ending the war as soon as possible. Italy’sPrime Minister Giorgia Melonialso reiterated that Rome won’t contribute troops to a possible military force to be deployed to Ukraine. She also underlined the importance of working with the U.S. on ending the conflict and called for the participation of an American delegation in the next coordination meeting. In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on Europe to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, the proposed contingent is seen as a test of the continent’s willingness to defend itself and its interests. While the U.S. has spearheaded ceasefire talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insisted that Europe, represented by Macron and Starmer, must also be at the negotiating table. “We do not consider any alternative,” he said. “This is our firm stance. Europe is vast, and it must have clear representation in these negotiations.” Summit participants were more in agreement that sanctions squeezing Russia’s economy must be continued, and even toughened, to force Moscow to negotiate in good faith. “Lifting sanctions on Russia right now would be a disaster for diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said. “Sanctions are one of the few real tools the world has to pressure Russia into serious talks.” Russia has demanded that sanctions be lifted to meet its terms for the Black Sea ceasefire. The White House said it would help restore Russia’s access to the world market for fertilizer and farm exports, but it didn’t validate Moscow’s conditions. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Russia’s demands would be evaluated and presented to Trump. Zelenskyy said: “They’re dragging out the talks and trying to get the U.S. stuck in endless, pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land.” As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine’s allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv’s hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression. Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support. Russian drone attacks overnight wounded at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a front-line community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram. Separately, the Ukrainian Army General Staff said that its attack at Engels military airfield in Russia on March 20 had destroyed 96 air-to-air cruise missiles and significant reserves of aviation fuel. Satellite imagery taken the next day by Maxar Technologies appeared to show damage to ammunition and weapons storage at Engels, the main base for Russia’s nuclear-capable strategic bombers. ___ Melley reported from London.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-847764,"Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanou was killed in an Israeli airstrike on northern Gaza, the IDF confirmed Thursday evening.
Al-Qanou was one of Hamas's most prominent spokesmen in Gaza, and while he avoided media appearances during the months of fighting, he gave multiple interviews to Arab news channels after the ceasefire.
Al-Qanou was killed when his tent was targeted in Jabaliya, the Hamas-run Al-Aqsa television reported. The same airstrike wounded several people, medical sources said.
Qatari-linked Al Araby Jadeed confirmed the death via sources in Gaza.
Who was al-Qanou?
According to Al Araby Jadeed, al-Qanou was born in Jabaliya, on April 24, 1981. He studied his undergraduate at the Islamic University of Gaza, followed by three masters degrees at universities in Gaza. The same report said al-Qanou had a doctorate in preaching and media from the University of Tripoli in Lebanon in 2019.
According to Al Araby Jadeed, al-Qanou joined the Hamas during the Second Intifada in 2000. After graudating university,
he was reportedly employed as media director at Hamas's media offices in the northern Gaza Strip, before becoming an official spokesman for the terror group in 2016.
Earlier this week, Israel killed Ismail Barhoum, a member of Hamas' political office, and Salah al-Bardaweel, another senior leader.
Both Bardaweel and Barhoum were members of the 20-member Hamas decision-making body - the political office - 11 of whom have been killed since the start of the war in late 2023, according to Hamas sources.
The IDF has yet to comment on the alleged elimination.
Increased IDF pressure in the Gaza Strip
Since fighting in Gaza was renewed at the beginning of last week, the IDF has killed 150 terrorists, including 10 top Hamas officials, The Jerusalem Post learned Tuesday.
In certain areas, the military has entered a full kilometer into Gaza, such as around the Nitzanim Corridor in central Gaza.
In addition to central Gaza, Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, parts of Khan Yunis, Shaboura, and Tel Sultan, the IDF has been evacuating and moving into Jabaliya.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4vjwzv22eo,"Germany has said it ""will not give in"" and that Europe must ""respond firmly"" as US President Donald Trump targets imported cars and car parts with a 25% tax in his latest tariffs. Other major world economies have vowed to retaliate, with France's president branding the move ""a waste of time"" and ""incoherent"", Canada calling it a ""direct attack"", and China accusing Washington of violating international trade rules. Carmaker stocks from Japan to Germany dipped. In the US, General Motors dropped 7%, while Ford fell more than 2%. Trump has threatened to impose ""far larger"" tariffs if Europe works with Canada to do what he describes as ""economic harm"" to the US. The fresh car tariffs will come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later. Trump has long maintained the tariffs are part of a drive to help US manufacturing and says if cars are made in America there will be ""absolutely no tariff"". Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. While the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for companies reliant on parts from abroad. The firms that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers. The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (Â£186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales. Mexico is the top supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany. Analysts have estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the European Union must ""respond firmly"". ""It must be clear that we will not give in to the US. We need to show strength and self-confidence,"" he added. France backed this joint approach, with its finance minister saying Europe must retaliate with tariffs on US products. At a press conference on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was ""not the time"" for the US to be imposing tariffs. ""Imposing tariffs means breaking value chains, it means creating in the short term an inflationary effect and destroying jobs,"" he said in Paris. ""All of this is rather a waste of time and will create a lot of worry,"" he added, urging Trump to reconsider. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a ""direct attack"" on his country and its car industry, adding it ""will hurt us"", but trade options were being discussed. In the UK, car industry body the SMMT said the car tariffs announcement was ""not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing"". Uniparts founder John Neill said the Trump tariffs were ""a gift to the Chinese"", because international consumers would respond to a trade war by buying Chinese alternatives. Meanwhile, China accused Trump of violating World Trade Organization rules. ""There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war. No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs,"" a spokesman for the foreign ministry said. There are warnings from Japan that there will be a ""significant impact"" on the economic relationship it shares with the US. A government spokesman described the measures as ""extremely regrettable"" and said officials had asked the US for an exemption. In South Korea, a day before the latest levy,Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (Â£16.3bn) in the USand build a new steel plant in Louisiana. Trump hailed the investment as a ""clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work"". Bosch - based in Germany - said it had confidence in the ""long-term potential"" of the North American market and would continue to expand its business there. The International Monetary Fund said it was not projecting a US recession, but warned a trade war could have a ""significant adverse effect"" on Canada and Mexico's economic outlooks. BBC Verify has looked into some of the claims made by the US president during his speech in Michigan. The university pledges to review its policies, though the proposals appear to fall short of White House demands. He tells a crowd in Michigan that he is using his presidency to deliver ""profound change"". The victims at the YNOT After School Camp are believed to range in age from seven to 18, authorities say.

Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression. Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support. Russian drone attacks overnight wounded at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a front-line community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram. Separately, the Ukrainian Army General Staff said that its attack at Engels military airfield in Russia on March 20 had destroyed 96 air-to-air cruise missiles and significant reserves of aviation fuel.

https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-crisis-recep-tayyip-erdogan-ekrem-imamoglu-arrest-eu-accession-funds/,"BRUSSELS — The European Union is set to keep pumping billions of euros into Turkey despite President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s sweeping crackdown on political opponents. Brussels warned its southern neighbor to “uphold democratic values” after authorities there arrested opposition leader Ekrem İmamoğlu over the weekend. But Turkey’s strategic importance means the bloc will likely end up turning a blind eye.   And Erdoğan knows it. As far as the Turkish leader is concerned, “whatever he does, the EU will have to tag along with it,” said Dimitar Bechev, a lecturer at the University of Oxford. Two European officials, granted anonymity to speak about closed-door talks, told POLITICO that Turkey’s status as an EU candidate obliges it to uphold democratic values, and that Brussels will respond to violations. “We are following the evolving situation in Turkey with great concern,” one of them said. With more than a thousand people, including journalists, detained by security forces since the unrest began last week, “the latest developments go against the very logic of EU accession.”  However, given Turkey’s importance on migration, trade, energy and defense, any response from the EU is unlikely to upend relations between Brussels and Ankara, the other conceded. Turkey applied to join the EU in 1999. Although talks have come to a standstill over the past decade, the country still receives billions in accession funds. Ankara has also received some €9 billion in aid to host refugees from the Middle East, and is in line for vast sums of money to support European defense industries. Now an important hub for oil and gas exports, Turkey enjoys trade flows with the EU worth more than €200 billion annually. Since Russia’s full-blown invasion of Ukraine in 2022 it has also been key to controlling access to the Black Sea and to enforcing sanctions against Moscow. It has recently been mooted as a major contributor to any eventual peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. “The status quo before İmamoğlu’s arrest was comfortable for the EU because there was just enough democracy,” Bechev said. Recent developments, he added, aren’t grave enough to change that. The best defense As an EU candidate country, Turkey can potentially access joint procurements worth €800 billion from funds designed to boost the bloc’s defense spending, according to the Readiness 2030 plan presented by EU leaders last week. However, Greece and Cyprus — both in long-running conflicts with Turkey — are pushing for restrictions, with diplomats telling POLITICO they intend to enforce a clause that would require the defense push to happen “without prejudice to the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.” With its NATO-trained armed forces and vast military-industrial complex, though, Ankara is convinced these objections will be overruled. If Europeans “want Turkish participation in certain areas — for example, sending troops to Ukraine in the future — then they will have to give access to Turkey,” said Turkey’s former Ambassador to the EU Selim Yenel. Yenel said the domestic situation was dire — “there is no law” left in Turkey, he claimed — but predicted that “since it seems that the EU needs Turkey, they will not put pressure on us.” Regarding the Western values countries must uphold for accession, he said, Erdoğan “is playing lip service to that.” Troubled waters Greece and Cyprus must now perform a delicate balancing act, having been in the process of normalizing relations with Ankara before the latest political crisis. “We will, of course, support a rigorous position condemning the current developments in Turkey, but without being the trigger,” said a senior Greek official, acknowledging that even Athens couldn’t go too far. “The defense industry remains a big gap for Europe, and this paves the way for this trade-off policy that we see taking place.” Cyprus is also in a difficult position, as Turkey appeared to strike a far more conciliatory tone during last week’s informal talks on the Cyprus problem held in Geneva. “Effective pressure from the EU is essential,” said Cypriot MEP Michalis Hadjipantela, calling for “targeted sanctions.” But at the same time, “measures should be targeted and linked to progress on the above issues in order to avoid further alienating the country, which would lead to more provocative policies.”",EU faces billion-euro dilemma over Turkey crisis,"Gabriel Gavin, Jacopo Barigazzi, Nektaria Stamouli",POLITICO,2025-03-27T03:01:00,2025-03-26T23:44:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-claims-growing-gaza-protests-against-its-rule-actually-aimed-at-israel/,"Hamas responded Thursday to growing public protests inside Gaza by insisting the demonstrations are directed against Israel and the ongoing war, rather than against the terror group ruling the Strip. Thousands of Gazans have taken to the streets this week in rare displays of public anger against Hamas, chanting for the end of the group’s nearly two-decade rule after it plunged the enclave into war by attacking southern Israel on October 7, taking hundreds of hostages, many of whom it is still holding. Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told the Qatari channel Al-Araby that “demonstrations are expected from people facing extermination, against war and destruction.” Despite multiple media reports, images, and videos from protests, as well as media interviews with Gazans to the contrary, Naim claimed the rallies are being misrepresented as criticizing Hamas’s de facto regime. “People are calling to stop the aggression, but the enemy and other parties with political agendas are diverting the spontaneous protests to serve the occupation’s agenda and trying to portray it as if the demonstrators are against the resistance,” he said — a reference to Hamas and other terror groups in Gaza. “Those who are trying to portray the protests as demonstrations against Hamas are the same people who have been doing this for years from Arab and European cities to serve (foreign) interests,” he added, without specifying which actors he was referring to. Naim further claimed that the authoritarian Islamist group allows residents to show dissent. “We understand well that our people are politically diverse, and we protect both opinions and opposing views,” he said.Â “No one has the right to forbid anyone from expressing their opinion. But the people took to the streets calling to stop the war and end the aggression.” On Wednesday, thousands of people rallied throughout Gaza, chanting “Hamas out.” The protest followed a smaller demonstration a day earlier in Beit Lahiya, north of Gaza City, which drew wide media attention. Some protest participants spoke directly to the media Wednesday, criticizing Hamas over the war. “They made the residents into rabbits, and now they have broken free of the fear because they have nothing to lose,” a Gazan man named Sami Ubayed told Israel’s Ynet news outlet. “Residents have no water or electricity. Hamas is destroying Gaza and making us into stones, they must be removed from power. We won’t stop demonstrating, Hamas needs to be flexible and release the hostages.” Demonstrators carrying banners reading, “Hamas does not represent us,” were seen marching in Gaza City and the town of Beit Lahiya in the north of the territory. In Beit Lahiya, where a similar but far smaller protest took place Tuesday, about 3,000 people demonstrated Wednesday, with many chanting, “The people want the fall of Hamas.” In the hard-hit Shejaiyeh neighborhood of Gaza City, dozens of men chanted, “Out, out out! Hamas get out!” In some incidents, protesters at rallies urged Hamas to release hostages it is holding to expedite an end to the war that has devastated most areas of Gaza, making conditions harsh for residents. War erupted on October 7, 2023, when Hamas led some 5,000 attackers to invade southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. As they rampaged murderously through the region, the terrorists abducted 251 people, also mostly civilians, who were taken as hostages to the Gaza Strip. Israel retaliated with a military campaign to destroy Hamas and save the hostages. A complex, three-phase ceasefire that included the release of hostages in batches began on January 19 but collapsed after its first stage as Israel renewed air strikes amid mutual accusations of violations and as Hamas stopped releasing hostages. The terror group has violently cracked down on previous protests. This time, no outright intervention was apparent, which some saw as a sign of its waning power in the wake of Israel’s military campaign. The group’s armed personnel are also thought to be keeping a low profile since Israel resumed military action in Gaza earlier this month following the two-month ceasefire. Protests are relatively rare events in Gaza, especially against Hamas, which has maintained an iron grip on the Strip since it violently ousted the Palestinian Authority from the territory in 2007. While there have been more public statements by individuals in Gaza against Hamas rule since the war started, large-scale demonstrations against the group have been almost nonexistent. The last documented protest in the Strip against Hamas took place in January 2024, when Palestinians in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis called for an end to the war, the end of the terror group’s rule over Gaza, and the release of the Israeli hostages. Before the war, anti-Hamas protests were also relatively rare events and were often suppressed violently by the terror group. Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm, and send its leaders into exile. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a complete end to war, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas won a landslide victory in Gaza in the last Palestinian elections, held in 2006. It seized power in Gaza from the PA, which is based in the West Bank and dominated by the secular Fatah movement, the following year after months of factional unrest and a week of heavy street battles. Rights groups say both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas violently suppress dissent, quashing protests in the areas they control and jailing and torturing critics.",Hamas claims growing Gaza protests against its rule actually aimed at Israel,"Nurit Yohanan, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-03-27T09:48:11,2025-03-27T09:48:11,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-847639,"The Knesset approved on Thursday a bill proposal that dramatically amends the committee responsible for electing Israel’s judges, by increasing political involvement in judicial appointments at the expense of professional involvement. The bill is a watered-down version of one of the central components of the government’s 2023 judicial reforms, and marks a significant achievement for the reforms architect, Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Knesset Constitution Committee chairman MK Simcha Rothman. The Judicial Selection Committee’s makeup since 1953 has included nine members – three High Court judges, two ministers, two members of Knesset (traditionally one coalition and one opposition), and two representatives of the Israel Bar Association (IBA). According to the new proposal, which will apply beginning with the next Knesset, the two IBA members will be replaced by two “public representatives”, one appointed by the coalition and the other by the opposition. The public representatives must have the qualifications to be appointed as a High Court judge. In addition, according to the proposal, the majority necessary for High Court appointments will revert back to 5-4 instead of the current 7-2. However, every High Court appointment will require the agreement of at least one representative from the opposition and one from the coalition (or their respective public representatives). Appointments to all other judicial brackets will require approval of one member of the coalition, one from the opposition, and one of the judges. The proposal also includes a mechanism to prevent a deadlock in High Court appointments. If a year passes with at least two vacancies, the coalition and opposition will each propose three candidates, out of which the other side must choose one (along with the judges). The justice minister may only use this “deadlock mechanism” once per Knesset term. Finally, at least two thirds of the judges on the High Court must previously have been Regional Court judges. A draft of the current version was first presented on January 9 as a “compromise” between Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, and earned the support of two bereaved fathers, former minister Yizhar Shai and former Fire and Rescue Service head Dedi Simchi. Shai has since reneged on his support of the bill. The Sa’ar-Levin compromise included another component, that was not included in the legislation that passed on Thursday: Permanently limiting the power of the executive and legislative branches to arbitrarily pass quasi-constitutional basic laws for narrow, short-term, personal, and overtly political goals. Sa’ar said that this element was not included because it did not enjoy enough support in the coalition. Proponents of the bill argued that it was a worthy compromise, since it did not give the coalition total power over judicial appointments, and will only apply in the next Knesset. However, its detractors, including the opposition, the Attorney-General’s Office, and a wide array of civil society organizations, argued that increasing political involvement in the judicial selection process will negatively affect the court’s independence, as judicial appointments will become part of political negotiations. The bill became law exactly two years after the initial version stalled, following a warning by then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that the schism over the bill was harming national security. Netanyahu promptly fired Gallant, which ignited mass protests in what became known as “the Night of Gallant”. 67 Members of Knesset voted in favor of the bill, with one opposing. Members of the opposition parties walked out during the third reading, leaving the plenum half empty. ""We made history tonight,"" Levin said. ""The Supreme Court, through a process that has been accelerating for decades, has effectively nullified the Knesset."" ""I stand here today on your behalf, after decades in which your voice was not heard and your vote at the ballot box was trampled. We are opening a new chapter. The days of surrender and silence are over, never to return,"" he further stated. Knesset Constitution Committee head MK Simcha Rothman affirmed the bill ""is a crucial step in restoring the balance between the branches of government and returning decision-making power to the people of Israel."" ""The outline approved by the Knesset reflects an evolutionary and balanced change, based on our constitutional tradition,"" Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said. Opposition party heads noted following the vote, ""The Israeli government has just approved a law with a single purpose – to ensure that judges become subservient to the will of politicians."" ""This is happening while 59 hostages are still being held in Gaza. Instead of focusing all efforts on bringing them home and healing the nation’s wounds, this government is once again advancing the very legislation that divided the public before October 7."" They added they would ensure the bill ""is repealed"" in ""the next government."" Yesh Atid and the Movement for Quality of Government subsequently submitted a petition against the bill to the High Court of Justice. The votes came after the opposition attempted a parliamentary “hail mary” following an all-night filibuster. At approximately 5:00 a.m., the opposition removed all of its speakers in order to immediately begin voting. The move was an attempt to surprise the coalition and catch it unprepared, as initially voting was only scheduled to begin at approximately 9:00 a.m. The move failed, however, as Levin and Knesset Constitution Committee chairman MK Simcha Rothman drew out their closing speeches in order to enable all of the coalition’s MKs to make it to the plenum.

""If anyone were to make a miscalculation, thinking that they would be able to attack Poland without consequences or attack any other ally, our Alliance will respond forcefully.

Not for Europe or North America,” Rutte said in a speech in Warsaw. “The global security challenges are too great for any of us to face on our own.” He praised Poland as a reliable ally that makes significant contributions to the joint budget. For his part, the Polish prime minister thanked the NATO chief for his support of Shield East, a project planned between 2024 and 2028 to strengthen Poland's resilience to potential attacks and a hybrid war. The project was developed at the Polish Ministry of National Defence in response to Russian aggression against Ukraine and the growing threat from Russia. ""We take full responsibility as Poland for the security of Poland's eastern border but also of our European and NATO partners. For me, it is also very important to have a high assessment from the Nato secretary general of this project,"" Tusk said ""We have such and not a different geography; we have such and not a different history; we have a determination like no other NATO country today when it comes to investing in our defense,"" the head of the Polish government added.

https://apnews.com/article/china-france-foreign-ministry-economy-ukraine-trade-969ced6576ca477b85b0b3424bdbf6f8,"BEIJING (AP) — French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot began a two-day visit to China on Thursday and held talks with his Chinese counterpart on Ukraine and longstanding trade disputes between China and Europe. There was no word of any immediate progress, but both sides sounded positive on the state of relations. Barrot met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who said in a news conference afterward that both countries should “choose multilateralism over unilateralism ... and pursue mutual benefit and win-win outcomes instead of decoupling and isolation.” That echoed language frequently used by China in criticizing U.S. foreign policy and the Western-led political order. Barrot later met with Premier Li Qiang, who said: “As we all know, the world is currently not peaceful, and instability and uncertainty are increasing.” “As two independent and responsible major countries, China and France should strengthen cooperation. Through our cooperation, we should inject more certainty into bilateral relations and the world,” Li said. Barrot responded that the world was “indeed going through troubled times where a number of major principles, particularly those of multilateralism, are being shaken.” “In this context, a new Europe is rapidly emerging, its only compass being strategic autonomy. This new Europe is investing massively in its defense, in energy,” the minister said before reporters were escorted from the room. On Friday, Barrot will travel to Shanghai for meetings with local officials and business leaders. France has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its struggle against Russia’s invasion, while Beijing has backed Russia diplomatically and provided an economic lifeline by buying Russian natural resources. Barrot’s visit is an opportunity to gauge China’s attitude on Ukraine ahead of a major French-hosted meeting on a possible peacekeeping force for the country. The talks come as fissures are showing between the U.S. and Europe over support for Ukraine, with Washington increasingly seen as backing Moscow. French President François Macron said Wednesday that a proposed European armed force could be deployed in Ukraine in under an eventual peace deal, and could “respond” to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one. Europe has long complained of unfair Chinese trade practices that it says force European companies to take on Chinese partners, share business practices and result in a major Chinese trade surpluses. The sides also issued a joint statement reaffirming cooperation on climate change marking the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, saying “the agreement and its long-term goals even more requires all parties to inject political impetus into the international cooperation on jointly fighting climate change (and) protecting biodiversity and ecosystems.” China is both the largest producer and consumer of fossil fuels, mainly coal. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has started the one-year process to once again pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement and, formalizing another withdrawal from both climate and foreign aid programs, the Trump administration has told world financial institutions that the U.S is pulling out of the international climate Loss and Damage Fund. In its first 50 days, the Trump administration has eliminated or cut funding for environmental justice domestically, foreign aid, climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion.",France's foreign minister is in China to discuss Ukraine and trade issues,,AP News,2025-03-27T00:30:39,2025-03-27T05:31:12,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-847762,"Tehran released new footage of a missile city, claiming it to be “one of the hundreds of missile cities” operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on Tuesday, the semi-state official Tasnim news agency unveiled. This is the third facility of its kind to be revealed in under a month. Major General Mohammad Bagheri, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, and Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC Aerospace Forces were filmed traveling through the facility lined with hundreds of missiles. Kheibar Shekan (900-mile range), Haj Qassem (850-mile range), Ghadr H, (1,240-mile range), Sejjil (1,550-mile range), and Emad (1,050-mile range) missiles, as well as Paveh cruise missiles, are reported to be held in the city. The footage also revealed Bagheri stepping on an Israeli flag placed on the ground of the facility. 
“Iran’s iron fist is far stronger than before. 10 times stronger than True Promise I,” Bagheri claimed. “All the [defensive] dimensions that are required for generating a [military] capability that is 10 times [stronger than] the one deployed during Operation True Promise II, has been created…The enemy will definitely fall behind in this balance of power.”
‘True Promise II” references Iran’s April attack on Israel.

The officer was identified as Osmar Rodarte. He was 27. During a news conference, Yuba County District Attorney Clint Curry said multiple law enforcement agencies on Wednesday launched 20 search warrants across Yuba, Sutter, Tehama and Butte counties as a result of a years-long investigation into drug trafficking.

Both officer Rodarte and the gunman were hurt in the shootout. Anderson said first responders took Rodarte to the Adventist Health and Rideout hospital, where he later died of his injuries. He was a two-year veteran with the police department and a U.S. Army veteran. Find details on a procession for Rodarte on Thursday here.

Ambassador Hwang Joon-kook made the remarks, renewing Seoul's calls for Moscow and Pyongyang to end their miliary cooperation that has deepened following their ""comprehensive strategic partnership"" treaty, which North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed in June last year. ""This war has inflicted serious suffering not only on the Ukrainian people, and Russian soldiers and their families, but also on those of North Korea,"" he said during a U.N. Security Council meeting on the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine. He noted that interviews with North Korean troops, captured in Russia's front-line Kursk region, have revealed they were deceived by the North Korean leadership to believe that they were sent to Russia for training, not to fight in a war. ""Reportedly, their families remain unaware that their sons have been sent abroad to engage in another country's deadly conflict until the authorities issue a certificate of death.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/wildfires-ravaging-southern-south-korea-leave-24-dead-force-thousands-to-evacuate,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea’s worst ever have ravaged the country’s southern regions, killing 24 people, destroying more than 300 structures and forcing 28,800 residents to evacuate, officials said Wednesday. The death toll included a pilot who died after a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a blaze in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the hardest-hit areas. The aircraft had no other crew members. Police said that most of the dead are those in their 60s and 70s. READ MORE: Wildfires in Japan force residents to evacuate homes in mountains The National Fire Agency said at least 26 people sustained varying degrees of injuries. An ancient Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 17,752 hectares (43,866 acres), the government’s emergency response center said. In a televised address, South Korea’s acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were worse than many previous ones. “Damages are snowballing,” Han said. “There are concerns that we’ll have wildfire damages that we’ve never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week.” Han said crews struggled to extinguish the wildfires because strong winds swept the areas overnight. He also said about 4,650 firefighters, soldiers and other personnel were working Wednesday with the help of about 130 helicopters, adding that “a small amount” of 5-10 millimeters (0.1-0.3 inches) of rain was expected Thursday. As of Wednesday evening, firefighters were tackling at least six active wildfires, including in the southeastern coastal town of Yeongdeok, which alerted residents of the nearest village to evacuate to an indoor gymnasium. Strong winds and smoke-filled skies forced authorities in the southeastern city of Andong to order evacuations in two villages, including Puncheon, home to the Hahoe folk village — a UNESCO World Heritage Site founded around the 14th-15th century. Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri Mountain, one of the country’s largest national parks, as another fire spread closer. Observers say the ongoing wildfires are the third biggest in South Korea’s history in terms of land burned. The largest fires were in Andong, the neighboring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan. On Tuesday, officials said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again. The blaze in Uiseong destroyed about 20 of the 30 buildings and structures at Gounsa, a temple said to be originally built in the 7th century. Among the burned structures were two state-designated “treasures” — a pavilion-shaped building erected overlooking a stream in 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king. Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry said it protectively removed 500 inmates from a detention center in Cheongsong, another southern town, but no damages were reported to the facility. The Korea Forest Service said it had raised its wildfire warning to the highest level nationwide, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises. Among the dead were four firefighters and government workers who died in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds, according to officials. Government officials suspect human error caused several of the fires, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.","Wildfires ravaging southern South Korea leave 24 dead, force thousands to evacuate","Kim Tong-Hyung, Associated Press, Hyung-Jin Kim, Associated Press",PBS News,2025-03-26T15:50:30,2025-03-26T15:50:30,gemini-2.0-flash

Zuhair Qarout emphasized at a news conference in Damascus the catastrophic effect of the medication shortage on thousands of patients and their families across Syria. He described the shortage as a true public health and humanitarian crisis affecting some of the most vulnerable and fragile groups in society. Qarout urged the UN, World Health Organization, UNICEF, EU humanitarian aid agencies, and friendly and brotherly countries, as well as international NGOs, to provide necessary pharmaceutical support so Syria can continue to treat cancer patients. He stressed the urgent need to ease international restrictions to remove barriers hindering the import of medications. Bashar Assad, Syria’s leader for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia after anti-regime groups took control of Damascus on Dec. 8, ending the Baath Party regime, which had been in power since 1963.

https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-vladimir-putin-attack-poland-response-devastating/,"WARSAW — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Wednesday stressed that the transatlantic military alliance would respond to an attack with “full force.” “When it comes to the defense of Poland and the general defense of NATO territory, if anyone were to miscalculate and think they can get away with an attack on Poland or any other ally, they will be met with the full force of this fierce alliance,” Rutte		
said		
at a press conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk during a visit to Warsaw. “Our reaction will be devastating. This must be clear to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and anyone else who wants to attack us,” Rutte added, praising Poland for spending 4.7 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, the highest level in the alliance. ""Let's not forget that Russia is and remains the most significant and dark threat to our alliance. Let's not forget that Russia is moving to a wartime economy,"" Rutte said. Tusk underlined the importance of NATO to his country's security. ""It’s very important for us		[to hear]		the commitment		that		NATO		will		defend Poland in any critical situation,” he said, referring to the alliance’s common defense Article 5. The reassurances come as there is growing worry within the alliance about United States President Donald Trump's commitment to NATO and the disdain expressed by him and his top officials about Europe. However, Rutte insisted that the transatlantic relationship between the U.S. and Europe is “the pillar of our alliance and that’s not changing.” Poland has also built its security on its close relationship with the U.S. and has been careful not to cross Trump. However, there is concern about the peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia led by the U.S. administration, which Tusk admitted ""we can only influence to a limited extent, to put it mildly."" ""We, as Poland and NATO, must be ready for scenarios we don’t really write,"" he said. Poland has been a key ally of Ukraine and sees that country's continued survival as crucial to its national security. ""No one wants peace more than		we do		but only		a		just peace will give us all a sense of security. It’s a condition for the security of Poland, Europe, and NATO,” Tusk said. Poland is also beefing up its own defenses, spending €2.3 billion on the East Shield initiative, a series of fortifications on its borders with Russia and Belarus — a project that has been		backed by the European Union. “Poland is taking full responsibility for securing its eastern border, which is the border of the EU as well,"" the Polish prime minister said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93n05z48ldo,"Russia has said some Western sanctions must be lifted before it begins a maritime ceasefire with Ukraine. Within hours of the US announcing the two sides had agreed to halt strikes in the Black Sea in separate deals, the Kremlin said it would only take place once sanctions on a number of Russian banks were lifted. The demands include revoking sanctions on the state agricultural bank Rosselkhozbank and restoring the firms' access to the Swift international payment system. Overnight, Moscow launched a drone attack on the port city of Mykolaiv, Ukrainian officials said, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the strikes were ""a clear signal"" Russia did not want peace. After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU and its allies suspended access to Swift for a number of Russian financial institutions. The aim was for Russian companies to lose access to the normal smooth and instant transactions provided by Swift, disrupting payments for its valuable energy and agricultural exports. Reversing that decision would need EU approval, a step that would appear uncertain in light of recent European statements of support for Kyiv. A European Commission spokesperson said the withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukraine would be one of the main conditions to lift or amend any sanctions. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said that Russia could be trying to delay ending the war. ""I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they're dragging their feet. I've done it over the years,"" he said in an interview with Newsmax. The maritime ceasefire was announced by the US after three days of peace talks in Saudi Arabia. However Kyiv and Moscow later released conflicting statements on the details of the deal, including when and how it would start. Zelensky said he believed the deal did not require sanctions relief to come into force and would take effect immediately. He called the Kremlin's statement an attempt to ""manipulate"" the deals. The Black Sea has not been a central focus of fighting for some time. In the first stages of the war, Ukraine successfully targeted Russia's fleet in its Crimean home ports and as of last summer, Ukraine said it had destroyed 28 Russian vessels. With what was left of the Russian fleet fleeing south and east to Russian and Abkhazian ports, Ukraine has been successfully exporting goods - with grain exports at near pre-war levels - via shipping which hugged the western seaboard of the Black Sea. So any maritime ceasefire – if it comes into force – is unlikely to reshape the balance of the war that is largely being fought on the ground. But Dr Jenny Mathers, a senior professor of international politics at Aberystwyth University and expert on Russian politics, said the maritime ceasefire would provide Russia with a ""big advantage"" as it was currently struggling to export its agricultural produce. ""Ukraine has managed to get out a lot of its agricultural produce through the Black Sea, and it's managed to successfully target Russian shipping, so Russia doesn't use the Black Sea at the moment,"" Dr Mathers said. The Black Sea Grain Initiative was struck in 2022, allowing safe passage of commercial ships travelling to and from Ukraine, with UN officials helping Russia get its food and fertiliser exports to foreign markets in return. Russia withdrew from the agreement in summer 2023, arguing that financial sanctions were hindering its exports, and said it would view any vessel bound for Ukraine as a potential military target. The UN said on Wednesday that freedom of navigation in the Black Sea was a ""crucial contribution to global food security and supply chains"". A spokesperson said the UN was working with Russia to facilitate its food and fertiliser exports. Where a maritime ceasefire could make a difference is by protecting Ukrainian ports from Russian air strikes. ""For us, a ceasefire is primarily a cessation of shelling of civilian port infrastructure,"" said Dmytro Pletenchuk, the Ukrainian navy spokesperson. ""As of now, we're in control of the situation at sea; in the Black Sea, in the Azov Sea, and in the waters surrounding temporarily occupied Crimea. That's why for us, the Ukrainian navy, this situation would not really change anything."" After announcing the agreement on Tuesday, Washington said all parties would continue working towards a ""durable and lasting peace"", adding that the agreement would reopen an important trade route. Ukraine and Russia also committed to ""develop measures"" to implement a previously agreed ban on attacking each other's energy infrastructure, the White House said. The Black Sea is located south of Ukraine and to the west of Russia, and is also bordered by Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Georgia. It is also bordered by parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine - including Crimea.",Russia says sanctions must be lifted before Ukraine maritime ceasefire can start,"Jake Lapham, James Landale",BBC News,2025-03-26T06:52:09,2025-03-26T12:59:22,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/serbia-sonic-attack-protest-vucic-weapon-214ff2630733b68dd2987e411b405197,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Ivana Ilic Sunderic had never heard anything quite so alarming and disturbing at a protest as the sound that broke a commemorative silence during a huge anti-government rally in Serbia’s capital, Belgrade. “It was quiet and peaceful and then we heard something we could not see … like a sound rolling toward us, a whiz,” Ilic Sunderic said about the March 15 incident. “People started rushing for safety toward the pavement, feeling that something was moving toward us down the street.” It was “a subdued sound lasting only 2-3 seconds but very unusual and very frightening, like a sound from hell,” she said. Ilic Sunderic was not alone in describing the panic. Hundreds of others have offered similar accounts, triggering accusations that the police, military or security services under the tight control of authoritarian Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic used an acoustic crowd control weapon to target peaceful protesters. The weapons, which are illegal in Serbia, emit sound waves which can trigger sharp ear pain, disorientation, eardrum ruptures or even irreversible hearing damage. The incident piled more pressure on Vucic, who has been rattled by nearly five months of anti-corruption protests over the collapse in November of a concrete canopy at a railway station in the northern town of Novi Sad that killed 16 people. Serbia’s officials have issued often contradictory denials that an acoustic weapon was directed at the demonstrators. Calls have been mounting for answers as to what caused the sudden commotion, if not a sonic device. An Associated Press video shows thousands of protesters holding up their lit mobile phones in silence when they suddenly start running away in panic. A swooshing sound can then be heard. “I have been going to protests for 30 years but I’ve never heard anything like this,” Ilic Sunderic said. Lies and fabrications A defiant Vucic has rejected what he called “lies and fabrications” that the security services targeted the demonstrators with a sonic device. He said that such accusations are part of an alleged Western-orchestrated ploy to topple him. “If there was a single piece of evidence that a sound cannon was used against demonstrators, then I would no longer be president,” he said. Serbia’s police, army and the state security agency, BIA, initially all denied possessing the U.S.-made Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD), which is illegal in Serbia and some other countries. When presented with photos of the device mounted on an off-road vehicle and deployed at the rally of hundreds of thousands of protesters, officials admitted possessing a sonic weapon, but insisted it was not used against the protesters. The photos showed nothing more than “loudspeakers” that also are available on eBay, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said. The rectangular devices, purchased from a U.S. supplier in 2021, serve to emit warnings to the crowds in case of major trouble, he said. “Serbian police have never, including March 15, used any illegal or unallowed device that is not envisaged by the law, including the device known as a sound cannon,” Dacic said. “Police only use sound devices for warnings.” Sonic weapons use sound waves to incapacitate, disorient or harm individuals by harnessing acoustic energy, causing both physical and psychological effects, such as dizziness, disorientation or severe headaches. Experts doubt the official version Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare, radar and military communications at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said he reviewed some of the videos from the Belgrade stampede. “Extraordinary film of people gathering, protesting in the streets peacefully, the demonstration,” he said in an interview. “And suddenly, an almost kind of biblical passing of a huge number of people in a very panicked rush, very sudden and very panicked movement, and the likes of which I must confess I’ve never seen before.” He said it was clear that something caused several hundred people to suddenly panic and move in a very specific way, rushing for cover to the pavement and abandoning the middle of the street. “So certainly, the behavior that you see on the film does appear to be consistent with people reacting en masse to something that is making them feel deeply unsettled or deeply uncomfortable,” he said. Reports also have emerged of pressure on doctors at Serbia’s emergency clinics to withhold records of hundreds of people who sought medical help and advice after the rally. Predrag Petrovic, a research manager at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, a think tank, said, “We can claim with huge probability that some unconventional weapon, some version of a sonic cannon, was used.” “I have a lot of experience in participating and monitoring street protests and I have never seen a stampede happen in a second and along an almost straight line,” Petrovic said. In an online petition signed by over half a million people, the Serbian opposition Move-Change movement asked the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for an independent investigation. Several Serbian rights groups announced Tuesday they have taken the issue to the European Court of Human Rights, saying that they collected more than 4,000 testimonies from people who complained of various physical and psychological problems after the incident on March 15. The court in Strasbourg has given Serbia until the end of the month to respond, the groups said in a joint statement. Vucic’s pro-Russia government, however, invited the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Russia’s Federal Security Service, the FSB, to investigate. There has been no immediate answer from the American and Russian security agencies.",Was an illegal sonic weapon used against peaceful protesters in Serbia?,"Jovana Gec, Dusan Stojanovic",AP News,2025-03-26T04:18:20,2025-03-26T04:28:31,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/britain-inflation-economy-labour-79d215bf9f48551e8797c1dcddb8753c,"LONDON (AP) — The British economy will only grow by 1% this year, half the rate previously anticipated, Treasury chief Rachel Reeves conceded Wednesday in a statement to lawmakers about the state of the public finances that saw her trim spending so she could meet her self-imposed borrowing rules. Against that sluggish economic backdrop that she blamed on “global uncertainty,” but which critics say she is largely responsible for, Reeves insisted that it was imperative that the government lived within its means. Doing so, she said, was “an embodiment of this government’s unwavering commitment to bring stability to our economy.” Reeves’ statement came after the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, or OBR, found a 14 billion-pound ($18 billion) shortfall in light of the growth shortfall and higher debt interest payments. Reeves, whose official title is Chancellor of the Exchequer, has partly sought to fill that hole with measures to rein in tax avoidance and tax evasion, and by lowering the day-to-day costs of running government. Far more controversial are planned welfare cuts that have caused widespread unease within the governing left-of-center Labour Party. While a government-backed assessment found that the changes to disability benefits could push 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, into poverty, Reeves said that didn’t account for how the changes will move people into work and away from welfare. “That’s the best way to lift families out of poverty,” she said. Longer-term, the OBR forecasts were a bit more positive for the government with housing starts on course to meet a four-decade high following widespread planning reforms. Reeves was able to point to higher growth forecasts for the years ahead which, if they prove accurate, should ease the pressure on her to lower spending or increase taxes in the remaining years of this Parliament, which can run until the middle of 2029. However, the agency said the outlook looks “risky,” particularly on the international front. It highlighted risks posed by the prospect of a global trade war in light of the tariff policies being enacted by the Trump administration. Paul Johnson, director of the well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, said another growth downgrade in the fall ahead of the annual budget is “entirely possible” and that Reeves has left herself at the “mercy of events” given her iron-clad adherence to her fiscal rules. “What the Chancellor has all but guaranteed is another six months of damaging speculation and uncertainty over tax policy,” he said. Reflecting geopolitical turbulence caused by the return of U.S. President Donald Trump, Reeves told lawmakers that a “more insecure world” requires a greater focus on national security. As a result, she confirmed a 2.2 billion-pound ($2.9 billion) increase in defense spending, which Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said is the biggest increase since the end of the Cold War. “This additional investment is not just about increasing our national security but increasing our economic security, too,” Reeves said. “As defense spending rises, I want the whole country to feel the benefits.” The British economy, the sixth-largest in the world, has underperformed its long-run average since the global financial crisis of 2008-9, and the new Labour government has made boosting growth its number one economic policy. Critics say Reeves is partly responsible for gloomy economic news since Labour returned to power in July after 14 years, because she was overly downbeat when taking on her role and has since increased taxes, particularly on businesses. “She is the architect of her own misfortune,” said Mel Stride, the economy spokesperson for the main opposition Conservative Party. Reeves received some welcome news Wednesday, with official figures showing that consumer price inflation fell to 2.8% from 3% the previous month. Though still above the Bank of England’s 2% target, Reeves will hope that easing price pressures will lead to further interest rate reductions that would lower the government’s debt interest payments.",UK government plugs hole in finances as 2025 growth forecast is halved to 1%,Pan Pylas,AP News,2025-03-26T08:20:44,2025-03-26T13:39:43,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.politico.eu/article/armenia-adopts-law-launch-european-union-accession-process/,"Armenia’s parliament has officially adopted a law on launching the country’s accession process to the European Union.  The legislation, which was initiated by a public petition to lawmakers and has now passed its second reading, calls on the Armenian government to begin the process of gaining membership of the EU. The South Caucasus country has been Russia’s close ally in the region for decades, but recently it has sought to cut ties with Moscow as Armenia accused it of failing to provide support in a conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan. While Yerevan is now working to reach a historic peace treaty with Azerbaijan, it is also keen to strengthen ties with Brussels.  However, the process of joining the EU can take decades, as it includes assessments of a country’s compliance with the bloc’s criteria in a wide range of policy areas, such as the functioning of democratic institutions, the judiciary and fundamental rights — and countries could even backtrack during the process. This is now the case with one of Armenia’s other neighbors, Georgia, which was accepted by the EU as a candidate in 2023, but  Brussels halted the accession process as the country began an authoritarian pivot.  The Kremlin’s influence remains strong in Armenia, as it is heavily dependent on Russian energy and trade, and Yerevan even hosts a Russian military base.",Armenian parliament adopts law to launch EU membership process,Csongor Körömi,POLITICO,2025-03-26T12:24:26,2025-03-26T12:25:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-refuse-give-up-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-donald-trump/,"KYIV	— The Kremlin is not planning to hand over control of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe to Ukraine or any other nation. “The station’s return to the Russian nuclear industry is a long-overdue fact that the international community can only recognize. The transfer of ZNPP itself or control over it to Ukraine or any other country is impossible,” the Russian foreign ministry wrote Tuesday night, referring to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, also ruling out any joint operation of the station. The ZNPP, located in Enerhodar — a city in the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region — was a crucial cog in Ukraine’s energy system, producing six gigawatts of power and covering 20 percent of the country’s electricity needs. However, the plant has not been operational since the Russian army occupied it from March 2022, violently dispersing local resistance. Last week,POLITICO reportedthat United States President Donald Trump sees control of the ZNPP as a crucial energy source for the proposed minerals mining deal with Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the ZNPP is Ukraine’s state property. Still, he was open to cooperation with the American side on its restoration if Ukraine takes back control over the plant and the city of Enerhodar. The White House said the U.S. is discussing ZNPP control with Russia. But the Kremlin claims the plant is now Russian after sham referendums it conducted illegally and at gunpoint in four Ukrainian regions in 2022. Putin made the ZNPP Russian property by special order and now considers the station Russian “under international law.” “An important aspect is that close cooperation on impressive sabotage potential of NATO countries with Ukraine makes impossible even temporary admission of representatives of these states to ZNPP,” the Russian foreign ministry said, hinting at its demand to strip Ukraine of Western intelligence aid in any peace negotiations.",Russia refuses to give up massive Ukrainian nuclear plant to Trump or anyone else,Veronika Melkozerova,POLITICO,2025-03-26T05:55:11,2025-03-26T05:56:03,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-crisis-stockpile-supplies-war-disease-natural-disaster-roxana-minzatu/,"BRUSSELS â
				― Every citizen should stockpile enough food to be self-sufficient for at least 72 hours in case of crisis, the European Commission is to warn, according to a draft of its Preparedness Union Strategy seen by POLITICO.
				
				“In case of extreme disruptions, the initial period is the most critical,” the document says, setting out possible scenarios, from war to cyber attacks and deadly disease to climate-driven floods.
				
				Five years since the first Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns and three since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and with natural disasters and financial shocks an ever-present risk, the plan lands as Europe lurches from one crisis to another. “None of the major crises of the past years were isolated or short-lived,” the document says. “Europe cannot afford to remain reactive.”
				
				Commission Executive Vice President Roxana Mînzatu is scheduled to present the strategy on Wednesday.
				Its
				message is “fix your roof while the sun is shining,” Mînzatu told POLITICO ahead of the publication, adding the Commission’s aim is “helping individuals … on a household level.”
				
				According to the 17-page draft, the strategy should “create a secure and resilient EU with the capabilities required to anticipate and manage threats and hazards, independently of their nature or origin.”
				
				That includes providing guidance to member countries to “cover the storage of essential supplies, crisis planning, shelter availability, measures to ensure availability of critical ground and space,”
				the proposal states.
				
				Just weeks after Europe
				published
				its first ever
				defense strategy, the preparedness plan says it’s “a matter of urgency” for the EU and its countries to strengthen preparedness, across all sectors.
				
Hostile actors
				
				And preparing for war is right up there. While not bringing any new defense initiatives, the strategy proposes a crisis management model drawing from Northern European countries where society as a whole — from citizens to businesses and governments — is involved. The Commission’s plan draws on the conclusions of the
				Niinistö report, which laid out proposals to improve the EU’s readiness for war and civil defense.
				
				The geopolitical conflict threat can come virtually as well as in the form of military offensives.
				
				Europe should be more prepared for cyber attacks, the draft states. Since the war in Ukraine began, Russia has been ramping up activity in cyberspace, including targeting critical infrastructure such as energy networks. Europe’s eastern flank in particular has experienced a surge of cyber attacks.
				
				China, Iran and North Korea also consistently target western governments, companies and other key institutions. State-sponsored hybrid and cyberattacks have become a “permanent feature of today’s reality,” the paper argues.
				
				One key proposal is to set up a “European cybersecurity alert system,” which the Commission says would improve European threat detection and situational awareness. It also proposes digital training and help for countries hoping to join the EU, and calls for more use of cyber diplomacy and better cooperation with NATO.
				
				Many people do not know what to do in the face of natural disasters, Mînzatu said. | Jose Jordan via Getty Images
				
				Companies also have an active role to play in preparedness, as there’s a need to share information but also participate in “strategic foresight and anticipatory initiatives,” as well as training.
				
				“The EU needs to promote cooperation between public and private organisations in strategic sectors such as cybersecurity, ensuring the workforce needs and educational offer are aligned,” according to the draft.
				
Natural disasters
				
				Preparedness is “not just about potential man-made conflict,” Mînzatu said. “It is about how we react to floods; we have seen what has happened in Spain,” which suffered from 
				‘monster’ flooding last year, killing hundreds of people.
				
				Many people do not know what to do in the face of natural disasters, Mînzatu said. “All these types of crises require some set of basic skills, some understanding and knowledge about what to do first,” she said.
				
				The Commission proposes an EU-wide stockpiling strategy to strengthen access to critical resources including for emergency and disaster response, medical countermeasures, critical raw materials, energy equipment and possibly food and water. The strategy will combine centralized EU reserves with countries’ contributions, according to the report.
				
				It will also present a strategy to support medical countermeasures against public health threats — to be complemented by contingency stocks proposed in the
				Critical Medicines Act.
				
				And the Commission wants to strengthen its crisis response coordination, by creating a “crisis coordination hub,” building on the existing Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC). The hub will focus on anticipating and managing the consequences of crises across sectors, provide crisis-management support to the lead services and monitor the overall response to crises.
				
				While some EU countries want to focus investments on defense, others see climate-related issues as more important.
				Mînzatu argued these are two sides of the same coin.
				
				“You cannot have defense, you cannot have a green Europe without preparedness, and you cannot have preparedness by ignoring the green ambitions and the green targets of the [EU],” she said.
				
				Being better prepared is also going to require more flexible access to cash.
				
				The Commission proposes a review of the financial instruments for crisis response to ensure crisis financing mechanisms are scalable and can be adapted to evolving risks and crises. The executive also plans to embed preparedness in EU external investments, including through scaling up implementation of climate adaptation and resilience projects in partner countries.
				
				To solidify these measures, the Commission is mulling a new legislative package to set standards and measurable long-term preparedness targets.
				
				“The Commission will assess the need and feasibility of an EU Preparedness Law to strengthen the resilience of the vital societal functions by setting joint standards and measurable long-term targets,” the document reads.
				
				Preparedness and security will be “integrated and mainstreamed” in European legislation, policies and programs, according to the document, which lists 30 key actions under seven themes such as civil-military cooperation, public-private cooperation and population preparedness.
				
				An annex to the draft lists some 60 key actions to be implemented within the next two years, including stepping up monitoring of fake news, assessing the level of preparedness in financial services and working preparedness into school curriculums, all set for this year.

https://www.politico.eu/article/belgian-prosecutors-huawei-corruption-illegal-payments-letter/,"BRUSSELS — Belgian prosecutors are investigating whether Huawei made illegal payments to get an open letter written, signed by eight European parliamentarians, which defended the Chinese tech giant's interests, according to judicial documents seen by POLITICO. Belgian authorities this month raided 21 homes as part of a spiraling probe into “active corruption in the European Parliament” that “benefitted Huawei.” Investigators are looking into ""excessive gifts"" or “remuneration for taking political positions” that took place “from 2021 to the present day,” the prosecutors said. In a second major test of accountability for the European Parliament after the Qatargate scandal of 2022, four people have been charged with corruption and criminal organization and one with money laundering, the Belgian prosecutors' office said last week. According to an arrest warrant seen by POLITICO, first reported on by Italian daily La Repubblica, a key part of the investigation hinges on a letter sent by eight MEPs in February 2021 to three EU commissioners, in which they argue geopolitical tensions should not hinder the development of 5G equipment in Europe. That letter, although it does not mention Huawei by name, is seen as promoting the Chinese company's interests because it came as several EU governments were rolling out measures that sought to limit telecom operators’ use of Chinese equipment, arguing Beijing posed risks because of espionage, surveillance and potential economic dependency. Conservative Italian lawmaker Fulvio Martusciello, one of the signatories, posted the pro-Huawei letter on X on Feb. 15, 2021, but later deleted it. His former parliamentary adviser and his assistant have now both been arrested in relation to the Huawei probe, according to their lawyers. The assistant's contract has now been suspended. Cash for a letter The arrest warrant for Martusciello's assistant includes details from the Belgian prosecutors laying out the heart of the case, in which both she and his former adviser are alleged to have helped arrange payments for the letter, referred to as the ""5G"" letter in the judicial documents. The description of the Belgian probe, as provided by the investigative judge in charge of the case, says: ""A sum of €15,000 was offered to the writer of the 5G letter, while each co-signatory was offered €1,500."" “This transaction or proposed transaction is said to have been endorsed by HUAWEI's Chinese executives, in particular by .... [the] director of the Brussels office,” the document also reads. The director can only be identified as Abraham L. Moving on to bank details of what it describes as ""suspicious payments,"" the document sets out how the former adviser allegedly arranged for the payments via invoices ""in consideration of alleged consultancy services and campaign expenses, in the amounts of	 €18,450 and €27,500."" ""Assuming the facts are established, these amounts would represent the alleged compensation for the above-mentioned letter drafted by eight MEPs for the attention of three European Commissioners in favor of HUAWEI,"" the document continues. ""The investigation has brought to light the financial circuit of remunerations which would demonstrate the corruptive process."" As part of a series of bank transfers, the former adviser wired €6,700 to Martusciello, €1,000 to his assistant, and €14,800 to another parliamentary assistant, the warrant says. Several account holders	that received payments	remain unknown. When contacted by POLITICO, Belgian prosecutors declined to comment on an ongoing investigation. Martusciello did not respond to requests for comment about the bank transfers. Asked about Abraham L.'s alleged involvement in a bribery scheme, Huawei did not respond to a request for comment. A company spokesperson said in an earlier statement: “Huawei takes these allegations seriously and will urgently communicate with the investigation to further understand the situation. Huawei has a zero tolerance policy towards corruption or other wrongdoing, and we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations at all times.” Arrests and allegations Martusciello's current assistant was arrested in Italy last week as part of the Huawei probe. She ""was not involved in the political activities of Mr Martusciello, she only dealt with logistics,"" her lawyer Antimo Giaccio told POLITICO, adding she ""was very rarely at the European Parliament ... about 10 times."" Before an Italian judge on Tuesday, she rejected all the preliminary charges against her but said she stood ready to answer ""any questions from the Belgian authorities,"" her lawyer added. The former parliamentary adviser for Martusciello, who worked for him between 2015 and 2019, was also arrested in Paris last Thursday as part of the Huawei probe, his lawyer Benoît Martinez told POLITICO. “My client intends to fully cooperate with the Belgian authorities. He denies any involvement with the charges he’s suspected of,” he added. He declined to comment further on the charges related to his client. The Belgian secret services, which filed a declassified report that triggered the investigation, found digital evidence that the former adviser could have been involved in the drafting of the 2021 letter with one of Huawei's lobbyists, who can only be identified as Valerio O., the arrest warrant says. Valerio O.'s lawyer Denis Bosquet declined to comment. The investigators say the transfers can also ""be linked to the drafting by MEP Fulvio Martusciello of legislative amendments favorable to Huawei,"" and to a communication in which Valerio O. tells an employee of Huawei in Poland ""that they [Huawei] 'often cross the line and even pay for amendments.'"" The same month as promoting the letter, February 2021, Martusciello submitted amendments to a European parliamentary report that would favor Huawei's position in Europe. Martusciello did not reply to multiple requests for comment about the letter, but told POLITICO he didn’t know the charges against his assistant. He told Belgian newspaper Le Soir that he had never received anything from Huawei. “I've never been to China, I've never been to the stadium, I've never received a cell phone or any other gift,” he said. NGO Transparency International received an anonymous tip in connection to the 2021 letter and forwarded the tip to the EU's OLAF anti-fraud office, it said. The then-director of the civil rights group Michiel van Hulten this month posted on Bluesky that OLAF had dismissed the claims because of “insufficient suspicions” of wrongdoing. A spokesperson for OLAF confirmed it did not investigate the matter.	 Keeping a distance It remains unclear whether any of the co-signatories of the 2021 letter are being investigated by Belgian authorities as part of the Huawei corruption probe, but several of those current and former members of the European Parliament are now taking pains to distance themselves from it. POLITICO asked all of them about their involvement. Those who responded said they had not been contacted by authorities with regard to the letter. Italian conservative lawmaker Herbert Dorfmann insisted the text was Martusciello’s idea and said he would not have signed the letter had he known it was related to the Chinese firm. ""I have always been politically in favor of keeping Huawei out of the European market,"" he told POLITICO. He added neither he nor his team were offered money ""or any other form of compensation in exchange for [his] signature."" Former MEP Cristian-Silviu Bușoi, a Romanian conservative, stated he never consented to signing. “I looked through my official email and found no correspondence regarding this letter,” he said in a written statement. “I also do not recall giving verbal consent to Mr Martusciello, as is sometimes customary when colleagues seek support for their initiatives,” he also said, adding that neither he or his staff received any compensation nor were aware of any scheme related to the signature of the letter. Aldo Patriciello, a far-right Italian MEP, said in an email: ""I honestly struggle to remember whether the request for my signature came via email, phone call or WhatsApp."" He added that he had no direct or indirect relationship with Huawei or its lobbyists. Romanian conservative Daniel Buda, also a signatory, attributed his involvement to his team, stating he was informed through a briefing prepared by his office staff. “My support was solely driven by concerns about rural digital infrastructure, not influenced by external parties,” he said in an email. He added he had not been contacted by any investigative authority regarding the letter and that neither he or his team received any money in exchange for his signature. “I had no knowledge — neither then nor now — that behind this letter or activity there could be such a scheme,” he told POLITICO in a written statement. Former Italian social-democrat member Giuseppe Ferrandino said: “I am certain I never signed any letters of such kind"" and added he had never been contacted by any authorities regarding this topic.	""Nobody ever offered me money to influence my parliamentary activity,” he added. Other signatories included hard-right Italian lawmaker Giuseppe Milazzo and former Romanian social-democrat member Tudor Ciuhodaru, neither of whom responded to POLITICO’s requests for comment. Milazzo told Italian news agency ANSA that he had never had meetings related to the investigation into the Huawei case:	""I have never been offered and I have never accepted any money, gifts or any kind of favor, directly or indirectly, from [Huawei],"" he said. According to conversations with three former Huawei officials, the 2021 letter posted by Martusciello was meant to counter another open letter from October 2020 in which over 40 lawmakers urged the European Commission to impose stricter controls over the use of Chinese equipment in Europe.	 In a letter to European Parliament President Roberta Metsola on Wednesday, 28 members of the chamber urged the institution to “temporarily set aside any MEPs, credibly suspected of involvement, from any parliamentary activity relating to Chinese interests.”	 Aitor Hernández-Morales, Antoaneta Roussi and Paula Andrés Richart contributed reporting.",Belgian prosecutors probe whether Huawei paid for letter signed by 8 MEPs,"Elisa Braun, Max Griera, Mathieu Pollet, Ben Munster",POLITICO,2025-03-26T03:27:00,2025-03-26T07:18:28,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250326001000315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, March 26 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Wednesday denounced Japan's launch of a new military command aimed at better integrating its self-defense force units, claiming Tokyo is in the final stage of preparing to become a ""war state."" Japan on Monday launched the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) Joint Operation Command, a new command designed to oversee joint operations of its ground, maritime and air defense forces, in a bid to better respond to emergency situations and smoothly coordinate with U.S. troops in Japan. North Korea said Japan established the command for the ""practical"" use of long-range missiles as it has focused on preparations to become a war state for overseas aggression over the past 80 years since its defeat in World War II. ""Such a preparation has entered the final stage,"" the Korean Central News Agency said in a commentary. Citing Japan-led joint military drills with 11 nations last year and a trilateral naval exercise among South Korea, the United States and Japan in March, North Korea claimed Japan is gearing up to reach the front lines to realize its wartime militarism. North Korea has shown a sensitive reaction to Japan's military buildup. Last week, Pyongyang condemned Japan's move to consider long-range missiles on its southwestern island of Kyushu, warning the move would make it a ""common target"" for its neighboring countries. sooyeon@yna.co.kr(END)",N.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/us-has-given-syria-a-list-of-demands-for-sanction-relief-sources-say/,"WASHINGTON — The United States has handed Syria a list of conditions that it wants Damascus to fulfill in exchange for partial sanctions relief, six people familiar with the matter tell Reuters, including ensuring foreigners are not in senior governing roles. US Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Levant and Syria Natasha Franceschi gave the list of demands to Syrian foreign minister Asaad al-Shibani at an in-person meeting on the sidelines of a Syria donor conference in Brussels on March 18, according to two of the people — a US official and a Syrian source familiar with the matter. Reuters is first to report both the list and the in-person meeting, the first high-level direct contact between Damascus and Washington since US President Donald Trump took office on January 20, has been previously reported. Reuters spoke to six sources for this story, including two US officials, a Syrian source, a regional diplomat, and two sources in Washington familiar with the matter. They all requested anonymity to discuss the high-level diplomacy. Among the conditions placed by the United States are Syria’s destruction of any remaining chemical weapons stores and cooperation on counter-terrorism, the two US officials, the Syrian source, and both sources in Washington say. Another demand was making sure foreign fighters are not installed in senior roles in Syria’s governing structure, the US officials and one of the sources in Washington say. Syria has already appointed some foreign ex-rebels, including Uyghurs, a Jordanian, and a Turk, to its defense ministry — a move that alarmed foreign governments. Washington also asked Syria to appoint a liaison to assist US efforts to find Austin Tice, the US journalist who went missing in Syria over a decade ago, according to two US officials and both sources in Washington. In return for fulfilling all the demands, Washington would provide some sanctions relief, all six sources say. One specific action would be a two-year extension of an existing exemption for transactions with Syrian governing institutions and possibly the issuance of another exemption. The US would also issue a statement supporting Syria’s territorial integrity, the source says. Washington did not provide a specific timeline for the conditions to be fulfilled. Syria’s foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comments. A spokesperson for the State Department says the agency does not “discuss our private diplomatic conversations publicly.” Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce last week said Washington was monitoring the actions of the interim rulers.","US has given Syria a list of demands for sanction relief, sources say",Reuters,The Times of Israel,2025-03-25T17:25:33,2025-03-25T17:25:33,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250325-ukraine-russia-usa-putin-zelensky-trump-negotiations-us-proposal-ceasefire-black-sea-truce-riyadh,"The United States said on Tuesday it has reached separate agreements with Ukraine and Russia to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea and to implement a ban on attacks by the two countries on each other's energy facilities. The agreements, if implemented, would represent the clearest progress yet towards a wider ceasefire that Washington sees a stepping stone towards peace talks to bring an end to Russia's three-year-old war in Ukraine. The Kremlin confirmed Tuesday that Moscow had agreed to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea. Russia and the United States have also agreed to develop measures to halt strikes on Russian and Ukrainian energy facilities for a period of 30 days that began on March 18, it added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the truce was effective immediately on Tuesday and that he would seek more weapons and sanctions on Russia from US President	Donald Trump if Moscow broke the deals. ""If the Russians violate this, then I have a direct question for President Trump. If they violate, here is the evidence	– we ask for sanctions, we ask for weapons, etc,"" Zelensky told reporters at a news conference in Kyiv. The US agreement with Russia goes further than the agreement with Ukraine, with Washington committing to help seek the lifting of international sanctions on Russian agriculture and fertiliser exports, long a Russian demand. The Kremlin said the Black Sea agreements would not come into effect unless links between some Russian banks and the international financial system were restored. Zelensky said this was untrue, and that the deals did not require sanctions relief to come into force. Speaking in his nightly address to Ukrainians, he accused Moscow of trying to ""distort"" the agreements and ""deceive"" the world. Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv had agreed to both a maritime ceasefire and a pause by Russia and Ukraine in attacks on each other's energy infrastructure. But he said Kyiv would regard any movement of Russian military vessels outside the eastern part of the Black Sea as a violation and a threat. In this case Ukraine would have the full right to exercise self-defence, he said. Seeking to fulfil a pledge by Trump to end the war quickly, the US originally proposed a full 30-day ceasefire	– to which Ukraine agreed in principle on March 11	– as a step towards peace talks. But the Americans held separate talks in Saudi Arabia with Russia and Ukraine this week to discuss more limited ceasefires on energy and at sea, after Putin responded to the wider truce plan with a long list of conditions and questions. Trump is pressing both sides to bring a swift end to the war, something he promised to achieve when he ran for president last year. At the same time he is pursuing a rapid rapprochement with Moscow that both sides say could lead to lucrative business opportunities and cooperation across a wide range of areas, from minerals to sport and space exploration. Ukraine and its European allies fear Trump could strike a hasty deal with Putin that undermines their security and caves in to Russian demands, including for Kyiv to abandon its NATO ambitions and give up the entirety of four regions claimed by Russia as its own. Ukraine has rejected that as tantamount to surrender.

Israel would then reoccupy the Strip, marking the first time it has had full control over the area since Israel pulled out of it in 2005. The report emphasized that Israel's security cabinet has not yet approved the plan and that it claimed to have been formulated by IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir with backing from the ""far-right.""

According to coastguard spokesman Liu Dejun, the Chinese ships took “necessary control measures” and issued warnings to drive the Japanese boats away between March 21 and 24 after they entered what China considers to be its territorial waters. He did not elaborate on the specific actions taken against the Japanese vessels which were identified as the Rieimaru, Daihachikin Kai Maru, Daihachitaisei Maru and Senkoumaru No 2. “Diaoyu Islands and their affiliated islets are China’s inherent territory,” Liu said in a brief statement late on Monday. “We urge the Japanese side to immediately cease all illegal activities in these waters.” Liu added that the coastguard would continue to conduct rights protection and law enforcement patrols around the islands – known in Japan as the Senkakus – to safeguard China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights. The Diaoyus, which comprise five uninhabited islets and three reefs, are located 169km (105 miles) east of Taiwan and 409km west of Okinawa. The surrounding waters are believed to contain valuable resources, including fish, oil and natural gas. Earlier on Monday, Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest over the presence of China’s coastguard ships near the contested islets. Japanese officials had previously accused China of making “unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force”.",China coastguard drives off Japanese fishing boats in escalating island dispute,Enoch Wong,South China Morning Post,2025-03-25T03:00:07,2025-03-25T03:50:22,gemini-2.0-flash

Han made the remark during a Cabinet meeting, the first since he was reinstated as acting president after the Constitutional Court overturned his impeachment the previous day. ""The repercussions of the U.S.-triggered trade war are dealing a serious blow to the world, and the difficulties of people's livelihoods, as well as small merchants and the self-employed, are growing increasingly due to sluggish domestic demand and rising inflation,"" the acting president said. Acting President Han Duck-soo (R) speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the government complex in Seoul on March 25, 2025. (Yonhap) ""Our calling at this moment is to protect people's safety, secure the national interest from the trade war and swiftly draw up solutions to national issues through cooperation with the National Assembly."" Han said he will make every effort to navigate the ""tariff storm"" initiated by the U.S. by tapping into his past experience in trade and foreign policy, and actively work with both the ruling and opposition parties to provide relief to the crisis in people's livelihoods. He called on Cabinet members to continue to pursue government policies in a timely manner while communicating them to the public. On the wildfires that have been ravaging the nation's southeast since last Friday, Han vowed the government's unsparing support for quick damage recovery and every effort to swiftly put out the blazes with helicopters and on-ground personnel. On the end-of-month deadline for protesting medical school students to return to their classrooms, Han said his ""heart is heavy"" that many have yet to return a year after the government announced an admissions hike to address a shortage of doctors. ""Medical school students are talented people who will protect the lives of both the current and future generations of the Republic of Korea,"" he said, referring to South Korea by its formal name. ""These people must now return to their places."" Han also called on the military to maintain a watertight readiness posture to be able to respond firmly to any provocation from North Korea amid the grave security situation surrounding the nation. At a separate meeting of trade-related ministers later in the day, the acting president said he will replace the so-called external economic affairs meeting led by the deputy prime minister for economic affairs with an ""economic and security strategy task force"" led by himself to better respond to growing uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariff policies and other issues. Han specially called for thorough monitoring and responses ahead of the planned announcement of new U.S. tariffs on April 2. hague@yna.co.kr (END)","(LEAD) Acting president calls for protecting people's safety, national interest amid trade war",Lee Haye-ah,Yonhap News Agency,2025-03-25T13:49:32,2025-03-25T13:49:32,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-eu-defense-pact-really-does-depend-on-fish-european-minister-warns/,"BRUSSELS — A defense and security pact being drawn up between the U.K. and the EU will fall apart if Keir Starmer doesn't make concessions on fishing rights, according to a senior European politician. 
Jessica Rosencrantz, Sweden’s EU affairs minister, said it was vital to make fast progress on a formal security agreement with the U.K., especially at a time of heightened tension over Ukraine, as countries rapidly re-arm. Officials on both sides are looking to a summit in May as a moment when such a deal could be signed, at least in outline terms. 
But in an interview with POLITICO, the minister said EU member governments were unlikely to sign off on a security deal with the U.K. unless negotiations are also resolved on other “sensitive” issues, including access to British waters for European fishing fleets. A deal on fish would also help in “building trust” between London and Brussels, she added. 
“Just to be clear, I think it’s really important that the EU and U.K. work together on defense and security,” Rosencrantz said. “Obviously, there are other sensitive issues as well for many member states which also need to be resolved, fisheries being one.” 
Asked if it would be possible to complete a defense pact first and then move onto negotiating fishing rights, she said: “I think we have to find a way where we can do both because we want to move ahead with the defense partnership but for many countries it’s important to solve the other sensitive issues as well. And therefore I think it will be important to take steps also when it comes to fisheries and other topics.” 
While behind the scenes officials have let it be known that France in particular is determined to secure more advantageous fishing rights in return for a reset in the U.K.-EU relationship, it is rare for such a senior figure in a European government to publicly make the link between the defense pact and fish. 
Reset in relations
The issue of fishing rights dogged the negotiations over Britain's departure from the EU and soured relations between London and Paris after the U.K. left the bloc, especially during Boris Johnson’s tenure as U.K. prime minister, when he clashed repeatedly with French President Emmanuel Macron. 
British officials had hoped that Starmer’s plan for a “reset” in relations with the EU would get a quick win on security and defense, because the U.K.'s military is still held in high regard across Europe ― and it also has nuclear weapons ― making an alliance attractive. 
But numerous officials involved in the process say progress has slowed as a result of the question of fishing rights, along with issues such as a proposed youth mobility scheme and border policies for Gibraltar. Negotiations are ongoing with the aim of having an agreed plan ready to show off at a summit in the U.K. between Starmer and the EU's top brass on May 19. 
U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to downgrade American commitments on European security — and the EU’s plans to boost its homegrown defense industry in response — have added a layer of complexity to the talks on a British deal. 
Brussels has proposed a  €150 billion loan program for EU governments to spend on re-arming. The funds should be invested on a “buy more European” basis, according to Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president. 
But without a formal defense agreement with Brussels, the U.K. will be locked out of the scheme. If a deal is agreed, European governments will be free to use the funding to buy British-made weapons and equipment.
“We want the U.K. to be a part of this as well,” said Rosencrantz, the Swedish minister. “We have a joint interest, responsibility, we agree on the matter of supporting Ukraine, on ramping up on defense. We need to work together and it would be very, very good to have a partnership.”

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-chief-heads-to-meet-lutnick-greer-to-defuse-steel-aluminum-spat/,"BRUSSELS — European Union trade chief Maroš Šefčovič will meet with his U.S. counterparts Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer in Washington D.C. on Tuesday, in the EU’s latest effort to dampen soaring trade tensions with the United States. In a sign of the political sensitivity of the trip, Björn Seibert, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s top aide, will travel with Šefčovič. “We should be making every effort on both sides to avoid harmful tariffs and build — rather than tear down — the EU-U.S. trade and economic relationship, which is the strongest in the world,” Olof Gill, a Commission trade spokesperson, said on Monday. The visit comes as the EU weighs imposing retaliatory tariffs on €21.5 billion in U.S. exports to “mirror” the new, and broader, steel and aluminum duties imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month. Late last week, the Commission decided to delay one batch of its tariff response from April 1 to April 13. That bought time to negotiate with Washington and calibrate the EU’s response as Washington finalizes a fresh round of “reciprocal” tariffs due on April 2 — styled by Trump as “Liberation Day.” The U.S. president indicated last week that he was not open to granting exemptions from those tariffs — with the EU set to be caught among the worst hit. Brussels is also trying to rally some skeptical EU countries, such as France and Italy, which have lashed out against the inclusion of wine and alcohol in the lists of goods likely to be caught in the trade spat. It’s Šefčovič’s second trip to Washington since Trump took office in January. He will meet Lutnick, the Commerce secretary, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Tuesday. It wasn’t yet clear whether the EU trade negotiator would attend any other public engagements in Washington D.C. The Slovak commissioner is then due to fly to Beijing on Thursday and Friday for his first visit to China since being confirmed as EU trade commissioner late last year.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-24-2025-c0293b1b22dcd9178bf678763e01290e,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The United Nations said Monday it will “reduce its footprint” in the Gaza Strip after an Israeli tank strike hit one of its compounds last week, killing one staffer from Bulgaria and wounding five other employees. The world body will temporarily remove about a third of its approximately 100 international staffers working in Gaza, U.N. Secretary-General spokesman Stéphane Dujarric. He pointed to the increased danger after Israel relaunched its military campaign last week with bombardment that has since killed hundreds of Palestinians. Israel has also cut off all food, medicine, aid and other supplies to Gaza’s population for the past three weeks. Dujarric’s statement was the U.N’s first to point the finger at Israel in the March 19 explosion at the U.N. guesthouse in central Gaza. He said that “based on the information currently available,” the strikes on the site “were caused by an Israeli tank.” The Israeli military repeated its denial that it was responsible for the strike, which took place a day after Israel shattered Gaza’s 2-month-old ceasefire with a surprise bombardment across the Gaza Strip.  Dujarric said the U.N. “has made taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organization’s footprint in Gaza, even as humanitarian needs soar.” He said the U.N. “is not leaving Gaza,” pointing out that it still has about 13,000 national staff in Gaza, mainly working for UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.  New Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours killed more than 60 Palestinians around Gaza, the territory’s Health Ministry said. The ministry’s count does not distinguish between civilians and militants.  The ministry on Monday put out a list of the names of more than 15,000 children, 17 and under, killed by Israel’s campaign since it began more than 17 months ago. The list included nearly 5,000 children under the age of 6 who had been killed, including 876 infants who had not reached a year in age, Israel, which launched its campaign .in retaliation for Hamas’ October 2023 attack, says it has restarted its bombardment and cut off food to Gaza to force Hamas to accept new terms for the ceasefire and release more hostages. It says it targets Hamas members and positions, blaming the group for civilian deaths because it operates among the population. Air raid sirens and explosions were heard over Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and central Israel on Monday evening as the military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency rescue service said “teams are en-route to search areas where reports of rocket strikes have been received.” Yemen’s Houthi rebels have fired a handful of long-range missiles at Israel in the days since it resumed the war in Gaza. There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the Houthis.  Two rockets from the Gaza Strip were also intercepted after crossing into Israeli territory earlier Monday evening, setting off sirens, the Israeli military said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Al-Quds Brigades, the military arm of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, claimed responsibility. The U.N. reduction comes as aid workers and medical staff have come under fire.  The International Committee of the Red Cross said its office in the southern city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip was damaged by an explosive projectile Monday. It said no staff were hurt but the damage has a direct impact on its ability to operate. It did not specify who was behind the explosion. ICRC also said that on Sunday, contact was lost with emergency medical technicians from the Palestine Red Crescent Society and their whereabouts remain unknown. Last week, humanitarian workers in Gaza were killed and injured, it said. On Sunday, Israel struck the surgery ward at southern Gaza’s biggest hospital, killing two people and wounding others, many of whom were already injured by earlier strikes. One of those killed at Khan Younis’ Nasser Hospital was a teenage boy recovering from surgery.  The other was a Hamas official that Israel says was the target of the strike, Ismail Barhoum. Hamas said Barhoum was undergoing treatment at the time. The Israeli military denied that, saying he oversaw Hamas’ finances in Gaza, including transferring money to its armed wing, and was working out of the hospital. The strike last week on the U.N. compound outside Deir al-Balah killed a 51-year-old staffer, Marin Valev Marinov. He worked with the U.N. Office for Project Services, which carries out infrastructure and development projects around the world. In the two days before the deadly blast, strikes hit next to and then directly in the compound, UNOPS chief Jorge Moreira da Silva said earlier. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike and confirmed that the military was aware of the facility’s location.  Olga Cherevko, spokesperson for the U.N.’s humanitarian office, known as OCHA, said the U.N. and its partners have already suspended a number of activities, many in education, protection and water and sanitation services. The reason, she was, was safety concerns and the impact of Israeli evacuation orders. “A lot things are constrained right now because of the security situation,” she told AP before Dujarric’s announcement. “The challenges are massive. We have had a lot of our activities affected by the situation and a lot of our partners have had to suspend operations because it is just not safe.” Movement of trucks, including those distributing water, have been affected, she said. Only 29 out of 237 temporary learning spaces have resumed their activities since the ceasefire collapse, she said. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 113,000, according to the Health Ministry. Nearly 90% of the population of some 2,3 million have been driven from their homes. Israel launched the campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 others. ___ Lederer reported from the United Nations, Keath from Cairo.

https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seeks-full-control-of-occupied-ukrainian-regions-in-talks-with-us-media-reports/,"Russia is pushing to gain full control over four occupied Ukrainian oblasts—Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson—during negotiations with the United States in Saudi Arabia, the Moscow Times reported, citing sources familiar with the Kremlin’s strategy. Although Russian forces do not fully control any of these regions, the Kremlin demands them in their administrative borders, as defined in the Russian Constitution following their illegal annexation. A Kremlin-linked official told the Moscow Times that Russia's President Vladimir Putin cannot afford to lose these territories politically, and Russia intends to solidify its grip on them at any cost. ""The Constitution has no mechanism for regions to leave Russia. We need all of Zaporizhzhia and all of Kherson,"" the official reportedly said. The Kyiv Independent can't immediately verify these claims. Another Russian government source suggested that Moscow hopes Washington might pressure Kyiv to withdraw entirely from the occupied regions. ""Either Trump convinces them to leave, or we are told to enter prolonged negotiations while simultaneously using military force to secure control. That would be the worst scenario for us since river crossings are always costly operations,"" the source added. As an alternative, Russia may attempt to seize additional Ukrainian territory, such as parts of Dnipropetrovsk or Sumy oblasts, and then offer an exchange for Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, another Russian official speculated. ""We hope to find a way that avoids storming Kherson or forcing a crossing of the Dnipro River. That would mean thousands of casualties for us,"" he admitted. As of late 2024, Russian forces controlled about 98.5% of Luhansk Oblast and 60% of the Donetsk region. Despite these challenges, Russian diplomats believe that a potential Trump administration may be indifferent to the exact borders of a future settlement. ""From what I understand, Trump wants a modern, well-armed, pro-Western Ukraine,"" a Russian diplomat told the outlet. ""He cannot just hand over Ukraine entirely. But where exactly the border is drawn—that may not matter much to him.""","Russia seeks full control of partially occupied Ukrainian regions in talks with US, media reports",Olena Goncharova,The Kyiv Independent,2025-03-24T18:17:00,2025-03-25T03:19:28,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vzp3e62d4o,"Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed opposition parties for provoking a ""movement of violence"" as protests in the country continued for a sixth night. Unrest began in Istanbul last Wednesday when the city's Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu - Erdogan's main political rival - was detained on corruption charges. Imamoglu said the allegations against him were politically motivated, a claim Erdogan has denied. Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party's (CHP), which announced Imamoglu as its presidential candidate on Sunday, said the demonstrations will end on Tuesday, without saying what the next steps would be. Erdogan has labelled the demonstrations ""evil"" and blamed the opposition for ""disturbing the peace of our citizens with provocations"". Speaking from Ankara, Turkey's capital, Erdogan called for the protests to end and said that ""instead of responding to allegations"", opposition parties had ""made the most vile and unlawful statements in our political history for [the past] five days"". On Monday, vehicles carrying water cannons were seen close to the city hall, though protests appeared to be largely peaceful with no repeat of thefierce clashesseen on Sunday. Lydia, one of the demonstrators, told AFP that the Turkish authorities were ""hunting us like pests"", adding: ""They sprayed pepper spray on us like insecticides."" Young people - many of whom may not know any other government than this one under Erdogan - have played an important role in the protests. They have differing political views and do not appear to be affiliated with a particular political movement at the protests. They are rallying against the government, but they do not hesitate to criticise the opposition as well. Asked if she is afraid of the potential repercussions of demonstrating, one woman told the BBC: ""There is nothing left to lose."" Another, a 25-year-old woman who attended Sunday's protest, said she was afraid before - ""but now I'm just angry"". In figures released before Monday evening's gatherings, the Turkish government said 1,133 people had been arrested since the protests began. With the CHP apparently ending its rallies in Istanbul, it is unclear if other spontaneous protests will continue. CHP leader Ozgur Ozel spoke to the thousands gathered on Monday night, telling the crowd that the demonstration was ""an act of defiance against fascism"". Ozel said he would visit Imamoglu in jail in Silivri on Tuesday. He added that the CHP would appeal for him to be released pending trial, and for his trial to be shown live on state broadcaster TRT. Imamoglu was confirmed as the CHP's candidate for Turkey's 2028 presidential election on Monday, despite being in custody. The selection vote was symbolic as he had been the only person running. He had spent the previous night in jail after being formally arrested and charged with ""establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender"". He was also suspended from his post as mayor. Prosecutors had also accused him of ""aiding an armed terrorist organisation"", but this was not included in the charges. Before he was detained, Istanbul University said it was revoking Imamoglu's degree. If upheld, it would throw his presidential run into question, as the Turkish constitution requires presidents to have completed higher education. In a post on X over the weekend, Imamoglu said he would ""never bow"" and criticised his arrest as a ""black stain on our democracy"". His wife, Dilek Kaya Imamoglu, told demonstrators outside Istanbul's city hall that the ""injustice"" her husband faced had ""struck a chord with every conscience"". Much of the protesters' anger is directed at Erdogan and his government. ""I don't know what he did 20 years ago, but nowadays, he is just a dictator,"" Irmak, a 22-year-old university student, told the BBC World Service at a demonstration in the Sarachane area of Istanbul. Irmak and her friends, Ozge and Elif, said they had activated the location sharing feature on their phones, as they fear being detained by police. These demonstrations have been the largest in Turkey since the Gezi protests of 2013, which began in Istanbul over the demolition of a local park. They have been largely peaceful, but on Sunday police officers fired water cannons and used pepper spray as clashes unfolded. ""We are the fruits of the trees of the Gezis,"" Irmak said. ""We are here to protect democracy. It's not just about Ekrem Imamoglu - it's about Turkey's democracy."" Imamoglu was one of more than 100 people detained last week as part of an investigation. Others arrested included politicians, journalists and businessmen. ""We are not accepting this injustice,"" Mustafa, among the protesters, told the BBC. ""We want democracy and we want our friends back because Imomoglu is not the only one behind the bars right now."" He added: ""We want to re-establish democracy in this country and we want to save the republic from this authoritarian populist regime. And for the short term, we just want our mayor back, we want our friends back."" Imamoglu's arrest does not prevent his candidacy or election as president, but he will not be able to run if he is convicted of any of the charges against him. The opposition mayor is seen as one of the most formidable rivals of Erdogan, who has held office in Turkey for 22 years as both prime minister and president. Erdogan's term in office is due to expire in 2028, and under the current rules, he cannot stand again â	but he could call an early election or try to change the constitution to allow him to remain in power for longer. Turkey's Ministry of Justice has criticised those connecting Erdogan to the arrests, and insisted on its judicial independence. Additional reporting by Isabella Bull The mayor of Istanbul has been imprisoned on corruption and terrorism charges, prompting mass protests. The British rock band scraps a concert after the promoter insulted anti-government protesters. Demonstrators called for democracy to be defended after the arrest of opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu. Mark Lowen was covering the protests in Istanbul when he was arrested and later deported back to the UK, the BBC has said.

https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/greenland-trump-00246587,"Greenland did not invite an American delegation to come visit this week, the self-ruling island’s government said Monday, flatly denying a claim made by President Donald Trump. Usha Vance, the wife of Vice President JD Vance, will land in the Danish territory on Thursday, alongside National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. The planned visit has been met with anger in Greenland, with outgoing Prime Minister Múte B. Egede calling it part of the U.S.’ “very aggressive” bid to seize the Arctic island. “We are now at a level where this cannot in any way be characterized as a harmless visit from a politician’s wife. … The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,” he said. Trump told reporters Monday that Greenlandic “officials” requested Washington send a team to the island. “People from Greenland are asking us to go there,” he said. But Greenland’s government said that was false. “Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,” the government said in a post on Facebook. Pipaluk Lynge, a senior Greenlandic member of parliament who chairs the island’s foreign and security policy committee, told POLITICO that Trump’s claims that Greenland had invited the delegation were “not true.” She added that a protest was planned for Vance’s arrival in the town of Sisimiut, following two other demonstrations in recent weeks against Trump’s stated desire to take control of Greenland. “We are protesting politically [as] the people of Greenland,” she said. Trump floated the prospect of the U.S. acquiring Greenland in his first term but has raised the stakes since reentering the White House, calling it an “absolute necessity” and refusing to rule out taking the world’s largest island using military force or economic coercion. In January, the then-president-elect sent his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to visit the island to build support for a U.S. takeover in a trip that was panned by local lawmakers as a “staged” political stunt. Trump’s overtures have been met with fierce resistance in both Greenland — where all elected parties have rejected his annexation threats and polls show the vast majority of people oppose joining the U.S., instead favoring independence — as well as Denmark, which retains some authority over the island’s affairs. With its strategic spot in the Arctic and vast, largely untapped caches of mineral resources, including rare earths, Greenland occupies an increasingly important position in global politics. © 2025 POLITICO LLC","Greenland to Trump: No, we didn't invite you",Seb Starcevic,Politico,2025-03-24T19:14:15,2025-03-24T19:14:15,gemini-2.0-flash

The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) issued the message in a commentary, referring to the trilateral joint maritime drills conducted in international waters off South Korea's southern resort island of Jeju from Monday through Thursday last week. The naval drills -- the first of their kind this year and since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office in January -- involved the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and aimed to enhance deterrence against North Korea's military threats. The KCNA accused the trilateral drills of ""escalating the already tense regional political and military situation to the extremes,"" noting they were conducted alongside the joint annual South Korea-U.S. exercise, ""Freedom Shield."" ""The U.S.' adventuristic frenzy to dominate the entire Asia-Pacific, along with hostile forces, is completely exceeding all precedents,"" the KCNA said. The article also accused the Trump administration of merely ""inheriting"" hostile policies toward North Korea and advancing them further to stage ""a war gamble"" on the Korean Peninsula and beyond, while overturning other policies of the previous administration.

In less than a week of air and ground operations since Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas, its forces have killed hundreds of people in Gaza — sending the death toll from 17 months of war soaring above 50,000. Meanwhile, officials say Egypt has introduced a new proposal to try and get the ceasefire back on track. Hamas would release five living hostages, including an American-Israeli, in return for Israel allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza and a weekslong pause in the fighting, an Egyptian official said Monday. Israel would also release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. A Hamas official said the group had “responded positively” to the proposal, without elaborating. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the closed-door talks. Israel says it fired on a Red Cross office in Gaza by mistake. The Israeli military says its troops shot at the building after identifying a threat from Palestinian militants. “It was later determined that the identification was false,” the military said, adding that the soldiers didn’t realize the building was being used by the Red Cross. “The incident will be reviewed,” the brief statement said. The Red Cross says the building was damaged but no staff members were hurt. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says an Israeli drone strike in south Lebanon has killed one person. State-run News Agency quoted a Health Ministry statement as saying that the Monday night drone strike took place in the village of Qaaqaaiyet el-Jisr. It was not immediately clear who the target was. Israel has killed several Hezbollah members over the past weeks in drones strike on south Lebanon Israeli settlers beat up one of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning film “No Other Land ” in the occupied West Bank on Monday, and he was then detained by the Israeli military, activists on the scene said. Dozens of settlers attacked the Palestinian village of Susiya in the Masafer Yatta area, destroying property, said the activist group Center for Jewish Nonviolence. They attacked Hamdan Ballal, one of the documentary’s co-directors, leaving his head bleeding, the activists said. As he was being treated in an ambulance, soldiers detained him and a second Palestinian man, the group said. It said his whereabouts were now unknown. The Israeli military said it was looking into the episode but did not immediately comment. “No Other Land,” which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents of Masafer Yatta to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. It has two Palestinian co-directors, Ballal and Basel Adra, both residents of Masafar Yatta, and two Israeli directors, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor. Air raid sirens and explosions were heard over Jerusalem on Monday evening after the Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. Yemen’s Houthi rebels have fired a handful of long-range missiles at Israel in the days since Israeli forces resumed the war in Gaza. There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the Houthis. The Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, in a letter to the U.N. Security Council, referred to “baseless accusations” and threats by senior U.S. administration officials and President Donald Trump against Iran while trying to justify what he said were unlawful attacks against Yemen. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani warned that “any act of aggression will have severe consequences, for which the United States will bear full responsibility.” He said Iran will “resolutely defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity and national interests under international law against any hostile action.” The U.S. has launched a series of airstrikes against strongholds of Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who have disrupted international maritime trade by targeting ships in the Red Sea. He urged the Security Council to speak out against the U.S. “blatant provocations.” But since the U.S. has veto power in the council, there is no chance of that happening. Two rockets were intercepted after crossing into Israeli territory next to the Gaza Strip, setting off air raid sirens on Monday evening, the Israeli military said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Al-Quds Brigades, the military arm of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, claimed responsibility for firing a barrage of rockets toward the area of southern Israel bordering Gaza. Militants in Gaza have fired a handful of rockets at Israel in the days since it broke the ceasefire, which have been intercepted or fell in open areas. Islamic Jihad is the smaller of Gaza’s two main Palestinian militant groups. An Israeli strike killed at least five people including two women in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, the Health Ministry’s emergency service said. The strike Monday afternoon hit a house in the Qisan al-Najjar area, south of Khan Younis, it said. The United Nations said Monday it will “reduce its footprint” in the Gaza Strip after an Israeli tank strike hit one of its compounds, killing one staffer and wounding five others last week. Israel has denied it was behind the March 19 explosion at the U.N. guesthouse in central Gaza. In a statement Monday, U.N. Secretary-General spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said that “based on the information currently available,” the strikes on the site “were caused by an Israeli tank.” The Israeli military did not immediately comment. Dujarric also said the U.N. would be cutting back about a third of its approximately 100 international staffers in Gaza. He said the U.N. “is not leaving Gaza,” pointing out that it still has about 13,000 national staff in Gaza, mainly working for UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. The U.N. “has made taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organization’s footprint in Gaza, even as humanitarian needs soar,” he said. The move comes as Israel has cut off all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza’s around 2 million people for more than three weeks. “Violence feeds more violence,” European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday at a briefing in Jerusalem, where she met with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, less than a week after Israel broke the ceasefire in Gaza. “What we are witnessing now is a dangerous escalation. It is causing unbearable uncertainty for the hostages and their families and is likewise causing horror and death for the Palestinian people,” she added. Saar said the “war can end tomorrow with releasing our hostages, the demilitarization of Gaza and the withdrawal of the armed Hamas and Islamic Jihad forces.” The building was hit “by an explosive projectile despite being clearly marked and notified to all parties,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement decrying the attack Monday. No staff members were hurt, but damage to the office in Rafah “has a direct impact on the ICRC’s ability to operate” at a time when the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah is treating casualties from the war, the statement said. The ICRC statement did not say who might’ve been responsible for attacking their office. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strike. Israeli forces have been advancing into Rafah in recent days. Qatar’s Al Jazeera satellite news network says one of its Palestinian freelance reporters, Hossam Shabat, was killed by an Israeli airstrike on his car in northern Gaza. AP correspondent Naeun Kim reports on Israel’s deadly renewed assault in Gaza, including the bombing of a hospital. Shabat was killed Monday while covering the war for the broadcaster’s Arabic-language TV channel, the network said. He had been wounded by an Israeli strike last November, the network reported at the time. Another Palestinian journalist was killed in a separate Israeli airstrike earlier Monday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital. Mohammed Mansour was a correspondent for the news website Palestine Today. Al Jazeera is one of the few international media outlets to remain in Gaza throughout the war. The channel is owned by Qatar, which alongside Egypt and the U.S. has been a key negotiator for the ceasefire. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike that killed Shabat. Israel has accused other Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants. The channel denies the accusations and says Israel is trying to silence journalists covering the war. An Israeli anti-settlement group says there has been an “unprecedented surge” in approvals for new settler homes in the occupied West Bank since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office. During his first term, Trump strongly backed Israel’s claims to territories seized in war, at times upending decades of American foreign policy. Previous administrations have admonished Israel over settlement expansion while taking little action to curb it. The Peace Now group, which closely tracks settlement growth, said Monday that plans for 10,503 housing units in the West Bank have been advanced since the start of the year, compared to just 9,971 in all of 2024. It says another 1,344 homes are set to be approved on Wednesday. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution. Israel has built well over 100 settlements that are now home to over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The Israeli military says a senior Hamas leader killed in a strike on a hospital in the Gaza Strip was in charge of the group’s finances. Ismail Barhoum was killed in an Israeli strike late Sunday on Nasser Hospital, where Hamas said he was receiving treatment. The strike also killed a teenage boy recovering from surgery. The military said Monday that Barhoum oversaw Hamas’ finances in Gaza and transferred funds to its military wing. It said he was also serving as the head of Hamas’ government in Gaza after replacing another senior official killed in a strike last week. Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani denied that Barhoum was receiving medical treatment in the hospital, saying he had been there for weeks meeting with other senior militants. Israel has killed most of Hamas’ top leaders and scores of mid-level commanders during the 17-month war. The group was still able to quickly reassert control over the territory during a ceasefire that took hold in January. The Gaza Health Ministry said Monday the bodies of 61 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 143 wounded, it said in its daily report. The overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war rose to at least 50,082, the ministry said. Another 113,408 have been wounded, it said. Its figures do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The Palestinian Civil Defense agency says it has lost contact with six of its members who went on a rescue mission in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The emergency workers group said its members along with others from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society went to Rafah on Sunday morning after receiving calls that Israeli troops entered the area of Hashasheen in western Rafah. It added in a statement Monday that since then, there has been no word from the paramedics. The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that on Sunday, contact was lost with emergency medical technicians from its sister organization, the Palestine Red Crescent Society, and their whereabouts remain unknown. Palestinian medics say an Israeli strike hit a school where displaced people were sheltering in the Gaza Strip, killing at least four people, including a child. Another 18 people were wounded in Monday’s strike in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Three other hospitals had earlier reported 25 deaths from Israeli strikes overnight and into Monday. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. Israeli officials say an attacker in a vehicle ran over several people at a bus stop in northern Israel before opening fire, killing a man in his 70s. Police said officers shot and killed the attacker, whose identity was not immediately disclosed. Police referred to it as a terrorist attack, indicating they believe the assailant was a Palestinian militant. Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said a man in his 70s was killed and another man, around 20 years old, was taken to a hospital in serious condition. There has been a surge in Palestinian attacks since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel ignited the war in the Gaza Strip. At the same time, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinians. Thousands of people are trapped in the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip after Israeli forces encircled part of it on Sunday, Palestinian officials said. Israel ordered the evacuation of the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood, telling people to leave by a single route on foot to Muwasi, a sprawling cluster of tent camps along the coast. Thousands fled, but residents said many were trapped by Israeli forces. The Rafah municipality said Monday that thousands were still trapped, including first responders from the Civil Defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government, and the Palestinian Red Crescent. Israel’s defense minister says it is trying to avoid harming civilians as it strikes Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Israel Katz’s statement came nearly a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians,mostly women and children, according to local health officials. Katz said Monday that “Israel is not fighting the civilians in Gaza and is doing everything that international law requires to mitigate harm to civilians.” He went on to blame Hamas for any civilian deaths, saying the militant group “fights in civilian dress, from civilian homes, and from behind civilians,” putting them in danger. He said Israel would not halt its offensive until Hamas releases all its hostages and is no longer in control of Gaza or a threat to Israel. Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 25 Palestinians, including several women and children, according to three hospitals. The strikes come nearly a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas with a surprise bombardment that killed hundreds. Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City received 11 bodies from strikes overnight into Monday, including three women and four children. One of the strikes killed two children, their parents, their grandmother and their uncle. Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis received seven bodies from strikes overnight and four from strikes the previous day. The European Hospital received three bodies from a strike near Khan Younis. Gaza’s Health Ministry said Sunday that the Palestinian death toll from the 17-month war has passed 50,000. It has said that women and children make up more than half the dead but does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. An American trauma surgeon working in Gaza says most of the patients injured in an Israeli attack on the largest hospital in southern Gaza had been previously wounded when Israel resumed airstrikes last week. Californian surgeon Feroze Sidhwa, who is working with the medical charity MedGlobal, said Monday he had been in the intensive care unit at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis when an airstrike hit surgical wards on Sunday. Most of the injured had been recovering from wounds suffered in airstrikes last week when Israel resumed the war, he said. “They were already trauma patients and now they’ve been traumatized for a second time,” Sidhwa, who was raised in Flint, Mich., told Australian Broadcasting Corp. Sidhwa said he had operated on a man and boy days before who died in the attack.",Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill scores in Gaza as Egypt offers new ceasefire proposal,The Associated Press,AP News,2025-03-24T07:26:54,2025-03-24T18:08:21,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/congo-m23-nangaa-rwanda-peace-talks-minerals-f6116d5f602bfdf0ab85fde97fa8dadb,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — The leader of the rebels who captured two key cities in eastern Congo tells The Associated Press that international sanctions and Congo’s proposed minerals deal with the United States in search of peace will not stop the fighting. Meanwhile, neighboring countries announced a broader peace facilitation team to seek a resolution to the conflict. With a $5 million bounty placed on the rebel leaders by Congo’s government, “we will fight like people who got nothing to lose in order to secure the future of our country,” said Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance that includes the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group. Nangaa dismissed Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi’s comments last week that his country — whose mineral resources are estimated to be worth $24 trillion and critical to much of the world’s technology — is looking for a minerals partnership with the U.S. The U.S. government has not publicly spoken about any such deal, which local observers say could be similar to the Trump administration’s recent offer to Ukraine to help end the war with Russia. “This problem can be better resolved by the concerned Congolese, not foreigners with different geopolitical agendas,” Nangaa told the AP over the weekend. “Trying to bribe U.S. with mines can undermine U.S. credibility.” The rebel leader also rejected the outcome of last week’s meeting between Congolese and Rwandan leaders in Qatar, saying such a move to achieve peace without his group’s involvement would fail. He said the rebels can only have a dialogue with Congo’s government if the country acknowledges their grievances and the root causes of the conflict. “Anything regarding us which are done without us, it’s against us,” Nangaa said. Since launching a major escalation of their decadelong fighting with Congolese forces in January, the M23 rebels have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and several towns in eastern Congo, prompting fears of regional war involving neighbors whose militaries are also on the ground. Efforts to achieve a ceasefire collapsed last week after the rebels pulled out of talks facilitated by Angola, condemning European Union sanctions on its leaders. After Angola’s president and chairperson of the African Union, Joao Lourenco, withdrew as the key mediator on Monday, southern and eastern African leaders announced at a joint summit that a panel of five former African presidents to help seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The panel will appoint a mediator to replace the Angolan leader, the president’s office in Congo said Tuesday in a statement posted on X. Also Monday, the M23 rebels said their planned withdrawal from the strategic town of Walikale, which they captured last week, is delayed because Congolese forces are allegedly still positioned in the area with attack drones. M23 spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said their presence “compromises” peace initiatives. The AP has reached out to Congo’s military. Holding Walikale gives the rebels control of a road linking four provinces in eastern Congo — North Kivu, South Kivu, Tshopo and Maniema — effectively cutting off Congolese army positions. The M23 is the most potent of about 100 armed factions vying for control in eastern Congo. It is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who failed to integrate into the Congolese army. The group says it is defending ethnic Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination. Although U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 forces from neighboring Rwanda supporting the rebels in Congo, Nangaa asserted that the rebel alliance is independent and seeks to address “the root cause of more than 30 years of instability in our country.”",Congo rebel leader says sanctions or minerals deal with the US won’t stop fighting in the east,Chinedu Asadu,AP News,2025-03-24T10:27:35,2025-03-25T06:12:44,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7v40e2p43o,"Chad has condemned a senior Sudanese general's threat to target its airports, calling it a ""declaration of war"". Its foreign ministry said it would respond according to international law if a ""square metre of Chadian territory is threatened"". The warning follows comments from Lt-Gen Yasir al-Atta, the deputy commander of Sudan's army, who said the UAE was using Chad's airports to deliver weapons to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The Sudanese army has repeatedly accused the UAE of supporting its rival, the RSF, throughout the brutal two-year civil war, which has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. UN experts have described accusations of the UAE smuggling weapons to the RSF through Chad as ""credible"", but the UAE has denied this. Lt-Gen Atta's comments follow Sudan's recent decision to take the UAE to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over its alleged support of the RSF. Speaking at a ceremony for an army officer killed in a drone attack by the RSF on Friday while the army was recapturing the presidential palace, he said airports in Chad's capital N'Djamena and the eastern city Amdjarass were ""legitimate targets"". Lt-Gen Atta said ""retaliatory action"" would be taken against the UAE, South Sudan and Chad's President Mahamat Déby. South Sudan has also been accused of backing the RSF. It has denied backing any side in the conflict. ""We know what we are saying, and our words are not a joke at all, nor are they spoken lightly,"" Lt-Gen Atta warned. The BBC has reached out to Sudan's authorities for clarification on his comments. They reflect the Sudanese army's deep frustration with not only the UAE, but neighbouring countries, accused of allowing their territory to be used as supply routes for the RSF. In December, Sudan's defence ministry said that the weapons supplied included strategic drones that carry guided missiles. Chad has positioned itself as neutral, but the war of words exposes the growing regional instability caused by Sudan's civil war, which is complicated by the involvement of external players. ""General al-Atta should stop uttering foolish threats and focus on the urgent need for an immediate cessation of hostilities and engage without delay in a constructive dialogue in favour of a peaceful and lasting solution,"" said Chad, highlighting that it is hosting hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees, mostly from the neighbouring region of Darfur, which is largely under RSF control. The harsh exchange came as the RSF claimed to have seized al-Malha in Darfur, a town located on a vital trade route from Chad and Libya. It also serves as a key crossroads leading to el-Fasher some 200km (125 miles) away, the last state capital in Darfur still in army hands, which the RSF has besieged for nearly a year. The group said it had ""encircled the enemy... leaving behind 380 dead,"" after months of fighting with a coalition of armed groups allied to the Sudanese army known as the Joint Forces. It claimed to have ""liberated"" the area and declared that it ""remained steadfast in [its] determination to end this war in favour of the Sudanese people"". The BBC spoke to two members of local activist groups, known as Emergency Response Rooms, who had been co-ordinating humanitarian relief for the town. We are not using their names to protect them and their families. They say that after the RSF took control of the town, it closed off roads to prevent people from fleeing and imposed a lockdown. Institutions are not working, says Ahmed (not his real name). The hospital is not functioning, the main market's been looted, and no-one's getting water, normally delivered from storage tanks by vendors. Estimates so far of those killed in the RSF advance range from 35 to 48. Ahmed, who monitors Darfur from outside the country, said this was because the group had cut off internet communications in al-Malha. He has not been able to make contact with his mother and 11 brothers and sisters to find out what happened to them Ismail (not his real name) managed to flee with his family during the night, to the village of Kenana, where many of those displaced from al-Malha are also struggling to get food and water. Others took refuge in the valleys among nomadic goat and camel herders, they told the BBC. Ismail said a lot of the people killed were merchants in the market, because they belonged to the Zaghawa community, the ethnic base of the Joint Forces. The RSF also burned down the homes of those they thought had a connection to either the military or the government. At least two traditional community leaders were killed, said Ahmed. Analysts say the RSF seems determined to consolidate its grip on its Darfur stronghold after months of army gains in central Sudan, and the capital, Khartoum. The leader of the group, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, has vowed to fight on in Khartoum despite the army's significant advance last week. The paramilitary fighters remain scattered in parts of the city centre including the airport, as well as the capital's south and west. But the army says it's been steadily seizing key infrastructure and buildings, including the central bank and state intelligence headquarters, as it consolidates control over the area. Fully reclaiming the rest of the capital would mark a pivotal point in the war, giving the Sudanese army a strategic advantage in the country's other battlefields. The military and government ministries moved their headquarters to Port Sudan after the RSF overran Khartoum early in the war But many observers believe there's a danger of de-facto partition, with the two warring parties and their backers entrenching themselves in their zones of influence.",Chad condemns Sudan's airport threat as 'declaration of war' ,Barbara Plett Usher,BBC News,2025-03-24T10:54:55,2025-03-24T10:54:55,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/turkey-istanbul-mayor-protest-journalists-detained-erdogan-f6e803ab00ce86097aba78b3a94ef061,"ISTANBUL (AP) — A media union said Turkish authorities arrested several journalists at their homes in a crackdown Monday, amid growing protests over the jailing of Istanbul’s mayor, a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A court on Sunday formally arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges. His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law. The Disk-Basin-Is media workers’ union said at least eight reporters and photojournalists were detained in what it called an “attack on press freedoms and the people’s right to learn the truth.” It called for their immediate release. The social media platform X said it was objecting to multiple court orders from Turkish authorities to block more than 700 accounts, including of news organizations, journalists and political figures in Turkey. A total of 1,133 people have been detained since the mayor was arrested at his home, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. As many as 123 police officers were injured in the protests, he said, adding that materials such as acid, firebombs and knives were seized. “Some circles have been exploiting the right to assemble and demonstrate, attempting to disrupt public order, incite street unrest and attack our police,” Yerlikaya said on social media. The minister said some of the detained were identified as having ties to groups listed as terrorist organizations and others had criminal records. Hundreds of thousands of people have come out for the largely peaceful protests across Turkey in support of the mayor. There has been some violence, with police deploying water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray and firing plastic pellets at protesters in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Some protesters hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at riot police. In a message on social media, Imamoglu urged people to rally outside city hall and other locations for a sixth night on Monday. He also called on youths to avoid clashes and asked police to treat demonstrators with kindness. “I’m working hard, I will work even harder. Where I am does not matter,” he said. The mayor’s jailing is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject the accusations and insist that Turkey’s courts operate independently. Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied. A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution. The Interior Ministry later said Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a “temporary measure.” The municipality previously appointed an acting mayor from its governing council. In a televised address following a Cabinet meeting, Erdogan accused the opposition party’s chairman Ozgur Ozel, who has called for peaceful protests, of disturbing public order instead of addressing the alleged corruption. He also said he would be held to account for the protests. “I have made this call several times before, and today I am repeating it: Stop disturbing our citizens’ peace with provocations. If you have the courage, account for the corruption, theft, bribes taken, and irregularities committed,” Erdogan said. Erdogan said: “of course, there will be political accountability for these actions in parliament and legal accountability in court.” Addressing demonstrators outside city hall for a sixth consecutive night, Ozel urged supporters to boycott a number of pro-government companies and television stations. He also challenged Erdogan and the Istanbul chief public prosecutor to broadcast Imamoglu’s trial live on state television, to allow the jailed mayor to respond to the allegations and “expose their lies.” About 15 minutes after Ozel addressed the crowd, police intervened with tear gas and plastic pellets to disperse the demonstrators. Imamoglu was taken to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, as more than 1.7 million members of his opposition Republican People’s Party, or CHP, held a primary election, endorsing him as its presidential candidate. Millions of non-members also cast votes in a “solidarity ballot,” the party said. Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul. One was replaced with a government appointee. A further 44 suspects were released under judicial control. Thousands of protesters rallied outside Istanbul’s city hall to voice anger over what they see as a crackdown on democratic freedoms. Tensions remained high as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas minutes after opposition leader Ozel’s daily address concluded. Protesters, many young and masked to avoid identification, hurled harsh words to the police and Erdogan and booed those in their ranks who threw bottles and flares at security forces to avoid elevated violence akin to Sunday’s police interventions. “I think it can’t get any worse than this,” said one female demonstrator who did not want to be named due to fear of detention. “We will never accept this. If necessary, I will come every day.” Others echoed her sentiment. “There is a coup against our democracy right now,” said an older male protester who also wished to remain anonymous. “We are here for our children, for the youth. We want them to be free so this country can be more beautiful.” Several protesters said their aim was not to support specific politicians but to stand up for the Turkish Republic. “I would like to say my name, but I cannot,” one man said. “The reason I came here is not Ozel or Imamoglu. I came here to defend my own rights as the youth of Ataturk (founder of the Turkish Republic). Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 43 protesters were detained Monday, and condemned what he called “vile insults” toward Erdogan and his late mother, vowing not to tolerate “such indecency.” Ali Mahir Basarir, a legislator from the main opposition Republican People’s Party, told the AP that the authorities used “pre-determined provocateurs” to justify crackdowns. “They start attacking the protesters before the rally is over,” he said. “All they want is a good future. They are exercising their constitutional rights.” and urged the police to not mistreat protesters. Meanwhile, authorities were investigating the office of Ankara’s mayor, another popular opposition figure, over the alleged misuse of public funds concerning the organization of 33 concerts, the municipality said Monday. Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey’s largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president’s Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan’s party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250324000700315,"SEOUL, March 24 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Monday denounced the latest annual joint military drills by South Korea and the United States, warning it will continue to strengthen its striking power to overwhelm any threats from its enemies. The disarmament and peace institute at North Korea's foreign ministry issued the condemnation after Seoul and Washington wrapped up their 11-day annual Freedom Shield exercise Thursday. Calling the exercise a ""planned and provocative nuclear war rehearsal,"" North Korea said the aggressive and offensive nature of this year's drills was the highest in history, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). ""Having a formidable attack power that no one can stop and an overwhelming striking power is the surest guarantee to preventing war and effectively containing and controlling any threat and blackmail from aggressors,"" the institute said in a statement carried by the KCNA. North Korea vowed to ""consistently renew and strengthen its responses in all areas to overwhelm any military act by its enemies,"" it added. North Korea has long denounced the allies' joint military drills as rehearsals for an invasion and uses them as a pretext for provocations. South Korea and the U.S. have said their exercises are defensive in nature. The North released a barrage of statements denouncing the joint drills as a ""dangerous provocative act"" and fired several ballistic missiles, believed to be close-range ones, on the first day of the exercise. But it did not carry out major provocations, such as the firing of long-range ballistic missiles, this year.

https://apnews.com/article/philippines-south-china-sea-dispute-xi-jinping-6a042bcf422b577458f5e09d4d1622ef,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine defense chief on Monday called China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea “the biggest fiction and lie” that no Southeast Asian country would accept and said that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s aggressive policies have undermined international goodwill fostered by his predecessors. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro fired off his latest tirade against China’s increasingly assertive actions in the region on the same day that the Philippine coast guard separately reported new incidents involving Chinese forces in the Scarborough Shoal, a hotly disputed fishing atoll in the disputed waterway. A Chinese military helicopter appeared to have tailed, but didn’t closely approach, a Philippine lightplane undertaking a routine patrol Monday over Scarborough. Chinese forces have separately installed a new floating barrier to prevent Filipino fishermen from entering a lagoon in the shoal, which lies off the northwestern Philippines, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela told an online news briefing. There was no immediate comment from Chinese officials, but in the past they have repeatedly asserted that Beijing has had sovereign control over the Scarborough Shoal and most of the South China Sea since ancient times. An international arbitration panel invalidated China’s expansive claims in a 2016 ruling based on the 1982 U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea, but Beijing refused to participate in the Philippines-initiated arbitration and continues to defy the decision. In a speech marking the anniversary of the Philippine military’s Western Command on Palawan province, which faces the South China Sea, Teodoro underscored the need for a “stronger national defense posture” and continued security engagement with allied countries to address the threat posed by Chinese aggression in the waterway, a key global trade route. “No ASEAN country accepts the legitimacy of that 10-dash line, because that is the biggest fiction and lie that can be sold to any right-thinking person,” Teodoro told Filipino forces. He was referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation regional bloc that has been negotiating a nonaggression pact called the “code of conduct” with China to prevent the territorial conflicts from spiraling out of control. ASEAN state members the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have been involved in the long-simmering territorial standoffs in the South China Sea. Taiwan also lays a claim similar to that of China, which has demarcated the extent of its declared territory with 10 linear dashes on Chinese maps. Teodoro said that Xi runs a “small dictatorship and autocracy” and that his “clique” in the Chinese Communist Party is to blame for what the defense chief called Beijing’s aggressive and illegal policies, not Xi’s predecessors or the Chinese people. “It’s caused by Xi Jinping and his abusive ways … that would possibly destroy his leadership of his party in China and the goodwill that was nurtured by his predecessors,” Teodoro told reporters. China’s aggressive actions in the disputed waters have prompted the Philippines to build stronger security alliances with friendly countries, Teodoro said. The Philippines, he said, would sign a visiting forces agreement with New Zealand next month to allow their forces to enter each other’s territory for joint military exercises. Negotiations have reached the final stage for a similar agreement with Canada, he said. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has authorized the start of negotiations for such an agreement with France, Teodoro said. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is due to meet with Teodoro on Friday in Manila for talks that Philippine officials said would spotlight concerns over China’s assertive actions in the contested waters and ways to strengthen the decades-long U.S.-Philippines treaty alliance.",Philippine defense chief calls China's claims in the South China Sea 'the biggest fiction and lie',Jim Gomez,AP News,2025-03-24T08:50:50,2025-03-24T11:22:21,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/senior-hamas-official-killed-in-targeted-strike-on-gaza-hospital-as-idf-offensive-widens/,"An Israeli airstrike on a Gaza hospital killed a senior member of Hamas’s political bureau Sunday night as the military moved to expand its renewed offensive across the Strip. Israel said it used precision weaponry to target and kill Ismail Barhoum at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, referring to him as a “key Hamas terrorist,” as the Palestinian terror group confirmed his death and said he had been undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in a previous strike. The strike was one of dozens reported across the territory Sunday and into the early morning hours of Monday, with a separate strike in the Khan Younis area reportedly killing a senior Hamas education official. The Israel Defense Forces also indicated it was preparing to expand ground operations, redeploying an armored division that had been stationed on the border with Lebanon. Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed the widening of the offensive in a statement hailing the killing of Barhoum. He described the Hamas official, a member of the terror group’s political bureau previously involved in financing its activities, as “the new Hamas prime minister in Gaza, who replaced Issam Da’alis, the previous prime minister who was eliminated a few days ago.” He was at least the fourth member of Hamas’s political bureau killed since Tuesday, when Israel resumed airstrikes in the territory after an impasse over continuing a ceasefire. Earlier Sunday, an Israeli airstrike near Khan Younis killed Salah al-Bardawil, another senior member of its political bureau. Out of the 20 members of Hamas’s political bureau elected in 2021, 11 have been assassinated during the war in Gaza. Seven are either certain or highly likely to be outside the Gaza Strip. The IDF said the strike was carried out following “an extensive intelligence-gathering process,” and that a “precision munition” was used to mitigate harm to civilians. The attack was caught on camera by both Al Jazeera and BBC Arabic. Footage from the scene following the blast showed that the hospital building was largely undamaged in the strike, except for fire blazing in one section off a stairwell. Palestinian health officials claimed the attack killed two people — Barhoum and a 16-year-old boy who had recently undergone surgery. Footage on social media appeared to show people extricating bodies and injured people from the rubble. “The Hamas terrorist organization exploits civilian infrastructure while brutally endangering the Gazan population. The cynical use of an active hospital as a shelter for the planning and executing of murderous terrorist attacks is in direct violation of international law,” the IDF statement read. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said the strike hit the surgery department at the hospital, and a Hamas source told AFP that “Barhoum was receiving treatment after sustaining critical injuries in an airstrike targeting his home in Khan Younis at dawn last Tuesday.” Barhoum was a member of Hamas’s political wing and had been involved in financial activities for the terror group, according to the European Union, which placed sanctions on him last year. In a separate announcement on Sunday, the IDF and Shin Bet security agency said two senior Hamas military wing commanders had been killed in recent airstrikes in the Gaza Strip. According to the army, Ahmad Salman ‘Awj Shimali, the deputy commander of the Gaza City Brigade, and Jamil Omar Jamil Wadiya, the commander of the brigade’s Shejaiya Battalion, were killed in airstrikes in recent days. The military did not detail where or when they were killed. According to the IDF, Shimali was “responsible for operations, planning the offensive strategy and building the brigade’s force in preparation for Hamas’s brutal massacre on October 7, [2023],” and during the war, he was responsible for the deployment of the brigade’s force. Wadiya took over the Shejaiya Battalion after his predecessors were killed in December 2023, according to the army. On December 2, 2023, the IDF killed Shejaiya Battalion commander Wissam Farhat and, a week later, it killed his replacement Emad Qariqa. “Wadiya was responsible for deploying the battalion’s forces against IDF troops and operated to restore and reorganize the battalion,” the military said. The statement added that Wadiya was also involved in a 2011 anti-tank missile attack on an Israeli school bus driving near the Gaza border. The attack killed 16-year-old Daniel Viflic. On Monday morning, Gazan media sources reported that overnight strikes had also killed Manar Abu Khater, director of education at the eastern Khan Younis education directorate for the Strip’s Hamas government, among others. A deadly strike was also reported in the Nuseirat area of central Gaza. Major mobilization of troops to Gaza Following the killing of Barhoum, Katz said that the ongoing offensive against Hamas was “expanding,” vowing that Israel would continue its strikes until the 59 hostages still held by terrorists in Gaza are released. The IDF said Sunday that thousands of troops were preparing to join military operations in Gaza, ramping up the military’s renewed ground offensive against the terror group, which has thus far been carried out with relatively limited forces. The army’s 36th Division, which spent months in the north and took part in a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon, was redeployed to the Southern Command and had begun preparations for military operations in the Gaza Strip, the IDF said. Currently, only the IDF’s Gaza Division and 252nd Reserve Division are carrying out operations inside the Gaza Strip. The move would add thousands of more troops to the offensive. Israel has threatened to expand operations in the Strip as it seeks to pile pressure on Hamas to free hostages still being held in the Strip. According to a report by Channel 12, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir was pushing to widen the military’s renewed offensive, citing Zamir as telling political officials in recent meetings that “Hamas is stalling for time, it’s a strategy, not a tactic.” “The IDF’s operation hurts [Hamas] and causes some movement, but it doesn’t lead it to release the hostages,” Zamir reportedly said. “Therefore, there is no choice, the pressure must be increased.” Despite the resumption of military activity in the Gaza Strip, the IDF Home Front Command on Sunday said it was further easing restrictions on civilians in southern Israel. Following an assessment, the Home Front Command said it has adjusted the activity scale permitted in the Gaza border communities from “partial activity” to “full activity,” meaning there would be no restrictions on schools and workplaces. Over the past week, schools and workplaces were only allowed to open if an adequate bomb shelter could be reached in time. Gatherings were still limited, however, to 2,000 people in several communities close to the Strip. Gatherings had been capped at 500 indoors and 100 outdoors over the past week. There have been just two rocket attacks from Gaza since Israel resumed its military campaign. Hamas on Thursday launched three long-range rockets at central Israel, and on Friday it fired two rockets at the southern coastal city of Ashkelon. New body formed to enable ‘voluntary’ departure of Gazans On Saturday night, the security cabinet approved a suggestion by Katz to establish a new administration in the Defense Ministry tasked with enabling Palestinians to “voluntarily” leave the Gaza Strip. In a statement Sunday morning, Katz’s office said the new directorate would work to “prepare for and enable safe and controlled passage of Gaza residents for their voluntary departure to third countries, including securing their movement, establishing movement routes, checking pedestrians at designated crossings in the Gaza Strip, as well as coordinating the provision of infrastructure that will enable passage by land, sea and air to the destination countries.” The head of the directorate will be selected by Katz soon, his office said. The statement added that the efforts to enable Gazans who seek to migrate from the Strip to do so are being carried out “subject to Israeli and international law, and in accordance with the vision of US President Donald Trump.” “We are working with all means to implement the US president’s vision, and we will allow any Gaza resident who wants to move to a third state to do so,” Katz said. The military resumed fighting in Gaza last week at the instruction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed that all negotiations for a hostage deal moving forward would be held under fire after Hamas rejected proposals to extend phase one of the previous ceasefire. Hamas has insisted on sticking to the terms of the deal agreed to by Netanyahu in January, which required the sides to begin holding talks on phase two in early February. Israel has largely refused to do so. Hamas refused proposals to keep the ceasefire afloat by extending its first phase. While Israel says its military campaign is necessary to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages, the families of many of those held captive have called for a renewed ceasefire. Terror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF. On Sunday, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claimed that the death toll since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas had crossed 50,000, adding that another 113,274 have been injured since the October 7, onslaught, when Hamas-led forces invaded, killing 1,200 and abducting the hostages in an unprecedented assault that overtly targeted civilians. The figures could not be independently verified and do not differentiate between combatants and civilians. Israel said it had killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools and mosques.",Senior Hamas official killed in targeted strike on Gaza hospital as IDF widens offensive,"Emanuel Fabian, Nurit Yohanan, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-03-23T23:44:53,2025-03-24T09:29:11,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/thailand-uyghur-deportation-china-xinjiang-162435b1c864e905313455a97ed77f1f,"BANGKOK (AP) — In late February, representatives of a Thai Muslim organization brought a reassuring message to 40 Uyghur men terrified they were going to be sent back to China: The government had no immediate plans to deport them. Less than 72 hours later, the men were on a plane bound for China’s far west Xinjiang region, where U.N. experts say they could face torture or other punishment. Thailand decided to deport the men more than a month earlier, while denying plans to do so to the public, lawmakers and Muslim religious leaders until almost the very end, according to testimony from parliamentary inquiries, interviews, meeting notes and voice messages. That gave the detainees and their advocates no chance to make a last-ditch appeal before they were bundled off and sent back to China. Now, the Thai government is dealing with the fallout of a move that outraged human right activists and allies. The decision is at the heart of Thai parliamentary inquiries and a diplomatic rift between Thailand and its biggest military ally. The United States has imposed sanctions on multiple Thai officials while the European Union and other allies issued condemnations. Thai officials visited Xinjiang last week to meet some of the deported Uyghurs and said they are being treated well. They have also said the men returned voluntarily, despite evidence to the contrary. The Uyghurs are a Turkic, majority Muslim ethnicity native to Xinjiang. After decades of conflict over suppression of their cultural identity, Beijing launched a brutal crackdown on the Uyghurs that some Western governments deem a genocide. The men deported last month were part of a larger group of Uyghurs detained in Thailand in 2014 after fleeing China. That left Thailand facing competing demands from Beijing and Washington. Beijing said the Uyghurs were terrorists and wanted them sent back, but hasn’t presented evidence. Uyghur activists and Western officials said the men are innocent and have urged their resettlement elsewhere. Facing potential backlash from all sides, Thailand kept the men in detention for over a decade. That changed when Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra took office last year. Her father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, has close links to top Chinese officials. Thai officials began secretly discussing plans to deport the Uyghurs as early as December, a month after Paetongtarn met Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the AP earlier reported. China sent a formal request to repatriate the Uyghurs on Jan. 8, according to records of a parliamentary inquiry held after the men had been sent back and lawmaker Rangsiman Rome. The same day, the men were asked to sign deportation papers, alarming them. They made a public appeal and went on a hunger strike, giving pause to Thai officials. Nonetheless, on Jan. 17, the National Security Council decided behind closed doors to deport the Uyghur detainees at a meeting attended by the ministers of defense and justice, the council’s Secretary-General Chatchai Bangchuad revealed to the parliamentary investigation. Chatchai said the decision was based in part on commitments from China that the men would be treated well and that Thailand would be allowed to check on them. That’s when the denials began. Shortly after the Jan. 17 meeting, Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters the government had no immediate plans for deportation. In a Jan. 29 parliamentary inquiry, the Thai government again denied plans to deport the men, according to the records of the meeting and an interview with Thai lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang. Thai Senator Angkhana Neelapaijit said the justice minister told her personally there were no plans to send the men to China just a week before they were deported. The Ministry of Justice referred the AP to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment. The foreign ministry declined to comment. In a Feb. 24 meeting, representatives of Sheikhul Islam, an official Islamic organization close to the Thai authorities, told the Uyghurs the government said they wouldn’t be sent to China, according to notes and recordings obtained by AP. A detainee described what Sheikhul Islam told them in two recordings, one sent to an advocate and the other to a relative in Europe. “They said they’re in touch with the government and they cannot guarantee the government won’t send us back later, but till now, they’re saying we won’t be sent back,” the detainee said. Both recordings were provided to the AP by the advocate and are two to three minutes long. The advocate asked for anonymity for themself and for the detainee to protect them from retribution. The description of the meeting in the recordings was corroborated by notes taken by a participant and shared by an activist, as well as an interview with another person with direct knowledge of the situation. That person, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, added that at least some of the Sheikhul Islam representatives believed that the men were not about to be deported based on assurances from the government. Sheikhul Islam declined to comment. The notes also make it clear the men did not want to go to China, contrary to the government’s claims. “The detainees asked for a prayer for them to not be deported,” the notes said. Three days later, in the early morning hours of Feb. 27, the men were put on trucks and driven away in the dead of night, black sheets drawn over the windows. The next day, Prime Minister Paetongtarn confirmed to reporters that she had discussed deportation with Chinese officials during a visit to Beijing in February. The Prime Minister’s office referred a request for comment to the “relevant parties” without saying who those parties were. The Ministry of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the wake of the deportation, Kannavee, Angkhana, Rangsiman and other lawmakers expressed outrage and demanded answers. The Thai parliament’s national security committee held an inquiry and called for footage of the deportation to be released. At first, top Thai officials said there were no other countries willing to offer asylum to the Uyghurs, but the U.S. and other countries have said they made repeated offers to take the men. In a further attempt to address the criticism, over half a dozen senior Thai officials visited Xinjiang last week at Beijing’s invitation. Select Thai media were invited, but an AP request to participate was denied. “There is no need to worry about the Uyghurs,” government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsab said Thursday in a statement. “They are living happily with their families.” Press releases and instructions given to media show the trip was carefully managed: The delegation met only six of the 40 men, according to a spokesperson, while media on the trip were ordered to avoid shooting images of the Uyghurs and Chinese officials, according to notes circulating among Thai reporters seen by AP. Images released from the visit blurred out almost all faces except those of Thai officials. Their deportation also caused a diplomatic rift between Thailand and Western countries. On March 14, the U.S. State Department announced visa sanctions on an unknown number of Thai officials for their role in the deportations, while the EU parliament passed a resolution condemning the deportation. The officials sanctioned by the U.S. were not named. Xinjiang authorities did not respond to a faxed request for comment. During a press conference last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning called the U.S. sanctions “illegal.” “China ... opposes the U.S. using human rights as a pretext to manipulate Xinjiang-related issues, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and disrupt normal law enforcement cooperation,” Mao said. ___ Kang reported from Beijing.

Early on Monday, police detained 10 Turkish journalists ""for covering the protests"", the MLSA rights group said in a statement, saying most were covering the mass demonstrations outside City Hall, where tens of thousands rallied late Sunday.
As on previous nights, the gathering descended into fierce clashes between protesters and riot police who could be seen kicking and beating people as they sought to disperse the crowds in Istanbul and elsewhere, AFP correspondents said.
Istanbul Governor Davut Gul accused demonstrators of ""damaging mosques and cemeteries"" in a post on X.
""We ask our citizens to stay away from environments where masked people are present and not to participate in any unauthorised demonstrations. Any attempt to disrupt public order will not be tolerated,"" he wrote.
Faced with the massive protests, Turkey's authorities sought to shut down more than 700 accounts on X, the online platform said Sunday.
""We object to multiple court orders from the Turkish Information and Communication Technologies Authority to block over 700 accounts of news organisations, journalists, political figures, students, and others within Turkiye,"" its communications team said in a statement.
""We believe this decision from the Turkish government is not only unlawful, it hinders millions of Turkish users from news and political discourse in their country,"" it said.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israel-admits-airstrike-on-gaza-hospital-says-it-targeted-key-hamas-terrorist/,"The Israeli military confirms hitting Gaza’s Nasser Hospital in an airstrike, saying it targeted a “key Hamas terrorist” using a precision bomb. The IDF does not name the person it targeted in the hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, but unverified reports from Gaza and the Saudi al-Hadath channel claim it was Ismail Barhoum, a senior member of Hamas’s politburo. In a joint statement with the Shin Bet, the IDF says the strike was carried out following “an extensive intelligence-gathering process.” It says a “precision munition” was used in order to mitigate harm to civilians. Palestinian media report an Israeli airstrike targeting the second floor of the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza's Khan Younis. There is no immediate comment from the IDF. Israel has long accused Hamas of using Gaza’s hospitals to hide personnel, weapons and command centers, but in the past, the IDF has carried out raids on such facilities with ground troops. “The Hamas terrorist organization exploits civilian infrastructure while brutally endangering the Gazan population. The cynical use of an active hospital as a shelter for the planning and executing of murderous terrorist attacks is in direct violation of international law,” the statement reads.","Israel confirms airstrike on Gaza hospital, says it targeted ‘key Hamas terrorist’",Emanuel Fabian,The Times of Israel,2025-03-23T20:17:29,2025-03-23T22:56:52,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/new-canadian-prime-minister-carney-will-run-in-ottawa-area-district-as-he-seeks-to-join-parliament-1868494,"TORONTO: New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will run in an Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament for the first time, two officials familiar with the matter said Saturday, a day before Carney triggers an early general election before a vote on April 28. The election will take place against the backdrop of a trade war and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Carney will run to represent the suburban Ottawa area of Nepean. The election campaign for 343 seats or districts in the House of Commons will last 37 days. The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister. Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader on March 9 following a leadership race by the governing party. Carney, sworn in as Canada’s 24th prime minister on March 14, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate. The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war. Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has upended Canadian politics. What Trump hasn’t said is that the almost daily attacks on Canada’s sovereignty have infuriated Canadians. That has led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers. The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump. Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. Carney still hasn’t had a phone call with Trump and that might not happen now until after the election. Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but he has not yet mentioned Carney’s name. Carney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013, he became the first noncitizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England — helping to manage the impact of Brexit. Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney’s main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada’s federal election this year until Trump’s near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them. Poilievre, 45, for years the party’s go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put “Canada first.” He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada’s public broadcaster. His party announced that it won’t allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes.",New Canadian Prime Minister Carney will run in Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament,AP,Deccan Chronicle,2025-03-22T21:39:14,2025-03-22T21:39:39,gemini-2.0-flash

The 88-year-old pontiff was discharged minutes later and doctors say he will need at least two months of rest at the Vatican. During the past five weeks, he presented ""two very critical episodes"" where his ""life was in danger"", Dr Sergio Alfieri, one of the doctors treating the Pope, said. Pope Francis was never intubated and always remained alert and oriented, Dr Alfieri said. Even though the Pope is not completely healed, he no longer has pneumonia and will return to work as soon as possible, if the trend continues, doctors say. Mayor of Rome Roberto Gualtieri told the BBC he felt ""a really great joy, great emotion to see Pope Francis leaving the hospital"". ""It's a great gift to the city and to the world... we support him and feel really close to him,"" the mayor said.

""I cried all the time because the love we breathe in this little square of this hospital was like heaven,"" said Ilaria Della Bidia, a singer from Rome.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4ynpzk8d8o,"Israel has carried out multiple air strikes on Lebanon after several rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel, in the worst violence since a ceasefire came into effect in November. The Israeli military said it had hit dozens of rocket launchers and a command centre belonging to Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group, in southern Lebanon. Lebanon's health ministry said seven people, including a child, were killed and 40 injured in the air strikes. Several armed groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah and Palestinian factions, and no-one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Hours after the first set of strikes, a second wave of attacks were carried out at night on targets that included what the Israeli military described as command centres, infrastructure sites and a weapons storage facility in Lebanon. Saturday's rocket attack from Lebanon came days after Israel reinforced its offensive against Hamas, a Hezbollah ally, in Gaza. The Israeli military said it had intercepted three rockets in the northern Israeli town of Metula, and there were no casualties. Hezbollah said it had no involvement, and it remained committed to the ceasefire. The Lebanese military said it had dismantled ""three primitive rocket launchers"" in the south, and the country's defence minister said an investigation had been launched into the attack. The developments put pressure on a fragile truce, brokered by the US and France, that ended more than a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, the Lebanese military would deploy thousands of additional soldiers to the south of the country to prevent armed groups from attacking Israel. Hezbollah was required to remove its fighters and weapons, while the Israeli military would withdraw from positions occupied in the war. But Israel has carried out nearly daily air strikes on what it describes as Hezbollah targets, and has indicated that attacks will continue to prevent the group from rearming. The Israeli military is still occupying five locations in southern Lebanon, in what the Lebanese government says is a violation of the country's sovereignty and a breach of the deal. Israel says the Lebanese military has not yet fully deployed to those areas, and that it needs to remain at those points to guarantee the security of its border communities. Saturday's attack is further proof of the challenges facing the Lebanese army, as it tries to exert control over southern areas where Hezbollah has traditionally had a strong presence and support. Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun, who came to power in January, has said only the state should have arms in the country, in what is seen as a reference to Hezbollah's arsenal. On Saturday, he condemned ""attempts to drag Lebanon into a cycle of violence"", while Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said the escalation carried the ""risk of dragging the country into another war"". The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, said it was ""alarmed by the possible escalation of violence"", urging both Israel and Lebanon to ""uphold their commitments"". Hezbollah was battered in the conflict with Israel: many of its leaders were assassinated, hundreds of fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. The group faces the huge challenge of providing financial help to its communities affected by the war, and pressure from its opponents to disarm. Lebanon's international partners say they will only help the country if the government acts to curb Hezbollah, the most powerful group in Lebanon. Hezbollah launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The longstanding conflict escalated and led to an intense Israeli air campaign across Lebanon, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. The offensive killed about 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's attacks, and to remove it from areas along the border.",Israel strikes Lebanon after first rocket attack since ceasefire,"Hugo Bachega, Jaroslav Lukiv",BBC News,2025-03-22T06:05:27,2025-03-22T17:20:42,gemini-2.0-flash

Ukraine does not know what format the U.S. will use to negotiate with Russia in Riyadh, Tykhyi said. ""This is their choice.

The U.K. government today confirmed it has frozen £25 billion in Russian assets, in the latest data released by the sanctions watchdog. The amount has increased by 10 percent in a year, or £2.3 billion, according to a report published today by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), the sanctions watchdog within the Treasury. OFSI's £25.03 billion figure relates to the frozen assets that have been reported to it since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022. In its 2023 report, OFSI said the frozen amount totaled £22.7 billion.  Europe holds a much larger amount of around €200 billion in immobilized Russian assets, most of which are held by Belgian's Euroclear. There have been mounting calls to seize the funds to support Ukraine. Earlier this month, a group of cross-party British MPs called on the government to use the frozen assets to help Kyiv in its fight against Russia.

In Europe, similar conversations are taking place, with the French parliament passing a non-binding resolution to demand the EU seize Russian assets to support Ukraine.  However, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever threw cold water on the prospect of Europe taking the funds on Thursday evening, telling reporters that doing so would be “an act of war.”  In response to OFSI's latest report, Economic Secretary to the Treasury Emma Reynolds said: “The UK has frozen £25 billion worth of Russian assets and working with our allies, we have deprived Russia of over $400 billion, the equivalent to four years of Russia’s military spending. We will continue to robustly enforce our financial sanctions as part of our wider response to Russia’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine.”",UK says it has £25 billion in frozen Russian assets,Eleanor Myers,POLITICO,2025-03-21T11:07:48Z,2025-03-21T14:05:35Z,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/germany-clears-e3-billion-military-aid-for-ukraine/,"Germany's budget committee approved yesterday another €3 billion in military aid for Ukraine after chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz pushed through reforms to ramp up investment in defence. Both houses of parliament passed plans this week by Merz's conservatives and the Social Democrats, who are in talks to form the next German government, that lift a long-held cap on debt. The fresh aid includes €2.5 billion this year, topped up by other contributions, including a reimbursement from the European Peace Facility. The Finance Ministry also plans to authorise commitments of €8.2 billion for the years 2026 to 2029, bringing the total to more than €11 billion. It was ""high time"" for the parliamentary committee to clear the use of the funds and Germany was now setting the pace for Europe's support of Ukraine, Foreign Minister Baerbock said in a statement. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, writing on X, said Kyiv was grateful for the assistance, which he said would strengthen defence and other related capabilities. ""German weapons have already saved thousands upon thousands of Ukrainian lives. They will save even more in the current and coming years,"" Sybiha wrote. ""A strong Ukrainian army will be the most important security factor in Ukraine and Europe for many years to come."" France is set to host a meeting of the coalition of willing on 27 March to offer Ukraine security guarantees without involving US troops and discuss a potential ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend the meeting in person, French President Emmanuel Macron said during the EU Summit on Thursday.
