https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2025/february/name-1041143-en.html,"RICHMOND, VA – Governor Glenn Youngkin announced today that he submitted an Expedited Major Disaster Declaration to President Donald J. Trump to support the ongoing response and recovery efforts of communities impacted by the recent winter storms.

“Over the past week, the Commonwealth has been hit extremely hard, particularly in areas that are still recovering from Hurricane Helene,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “This is the fifth major flood in this area in the past five years and there is significant damage that is affecting community lifelines. It is critical that we provide relief, and we will certainly take every measure possible to ensure that these areas are able to make a full recovery as quickly as possible. I want to thank our state and local agencies, and our federal, state and local elected officials for the incredible collaboration, and our first responders who have courageously made more than 150 swift water rescues and facilitated emergency operations that have saved lives throughout these storms.”

As the winter storms and flooding moved in, over seven inches of rain fell in some areas of Southwest Virginia with significant life-threatening flash flooding across Virginia’s most vulnerable and least resourced areas, resulting in historic river crests on the James River and other major waterways that have not been seen in the commonwealth since 1977. This resulted in critical infrastructure damages, over 203,000 customers without power at its peak, over 270 road closures including low water bridge and road washouts, and 9-1-1 center outages. The towns of Grundy and Hurley (Buchanan County) have experienced catastrophic flooding, with the river gauges in these towns spiking historical flood levels. Throughout the regions, over 150 swift water rescues, including evacuations, were made on Sunday, February 16. Support efforts continue as high water is blocking access to critical facilities, and access to the hardest hit areas is not yet available due to receding water and debris.

SUMMARY OF ALL EMERGENCY ACTIONS TAKEN

A State of Emergency was declared by Governor Youngkin on February 10, 2025.

The Virginia Emergency Support Team has been monitoring the forecast and activated the state emergency operations center to Yellow: Increased Readiness on 2 and moved to Red: Full Activation on 2 at 0700 to coordinate activities related to the storm.

The Logistics Support and Coordination Center is fully staffed and remains ready to deploy emergency response assets and supplies as needed to affected areas.

VDEM’s Regional Coordination Centers (RCC) were stood up across the commonwealth to coordinate local resource requests and needs.

VDEM is working with localities to assess the need to support residents without power with food, water, and resources for local warming centers as requested.

VDEM is coordinating and deploying water, meals, generators, and mass care supplies in support of ongoing local response and sheltering efforts.

Two Incident Management Type 1 Teams deployed to Southwest Virginia’s RCC to support the region.

VDEM is coordinating with the Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD) to provide support to the communities.

The VEST has held several calls with local elected officials to keep them updated on current impacts and response operations.

Swiftwater teams from the State Water Rescue Program from as far away as Virginia Beach were staged in Bristol, Wytheville, Lebanon and Norton These locations are used as starting points to access portions of Southwest Virginia quickly.

Two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters are also on station in the Southwest Virginia area and available for missions as needed through the weekend.

The VNG Black Hawk crews and Chesterfield Fire & Emergency Medical Services rescue technicians form the Virginia Helicopter Aquatic Rescue Team to provide rotary wing aviation hoist capabilities and aerial rescue evacuation. Four VNG Soldiers and three Chesterfield techs make up each HART crew.

Over 150 swift water rescues, including evacuations, have been performed.

Approximately 55 Virginia National Guard (VNG) Soldiers and Airmen provided commodity distribution, transportation and chain saw teams for debris reduction on Saturday, February 15, in Southwest Virginia. They are staged in Abingdon, Cedar Bluff and Wytheville and available for missions on Sunday, February 16.

VNG Soldiers linked up late Sunday evening with Richlands Fire Rescue Department to assist overnight with clearing debris and providing transportation assistance. Soldiers assisted evacuating 52 adults, 12 children, four infants and 26 pets to safety.

VNG Soldiers completed two missions on Saturday, February 15, assisting with commodity distribution in Dublin and debris reduction in Richlands.

The VNG conducted nine missions on February 14 and 15, distributing nearly 930 cases of water and more than 590 cases of food in Dublin, Hillsville, Pulaski and Rocky Mount. Soldiers cleared 13 trees and other debris in the vicinity of Fancy Gap.

Virginia State Police (VSP) adjusted manpower both on the roads and in dispatch centers to ensure that the department could respond efficiently to each crash. Additional troopers were brought in from across the state to support flooded areas in southwest Virginia.

VSP provided UAS capabilities to assist with damage assessment and has also staged Aviation resources in the region prior to the storm to mitigate impacts and assess damages as soon as the weather allows.

Virginia State Police troopers have been helping check on homes, assisting the Sheriff's Offices with calls, conducting rescues, and helping with detours. The evening of February 15, VSP rescued 6 people from cars in Buchanan.

In addition, VSP is providing the following assistance:

Multiple VSP swift water rescue teams are deployed, including troops and boats.

Three helicopters are staged in Abingdon for rescue missions and damage assessment.

VSP also has UTVs and drone teams on site.

Mobile Command Post was sent to Buchanan County at the Keen Mountain Correctional Center.

Communications techs are on site with a radio cache (30) and 2 satellite phones.

VSP brought in two squads, 28 trooper and 4 sergeants, from two other divisions for additional assistance

VSP Incident Management Team has also been deployed

VSP has an additional helicopter in Lynchburg and three in Chesterfield ready to respond.

As of Sunday, February 16, at 6:30 a.m., there are 12 primary roads and 234 secondary roads closed due to flooding, downed trees or utility lines. These closures are located in the Bristol, Culpeper, Lynchburg, Salem and Staunton districts. VDOT is actively responding.

Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) crews continue working 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, to address impacts from this latest storm. Additional resources are being deployed from less affected parts of the state to areas that experienced greater impacts.

Virginia Department of Forestry Forest Wardens are supporting fire department flood responses and swift water rescues in the counties of Bland, Buchanan, Dickenson, Russell, Smyth, Tazewell and Wise.

A portion of DOF’s Western Region Incident Management Team is working to coordinate the response and is provide logistical support of the agencies ongoing response efforts.

DOF will continue to provide staffing of both the state EOC and its agency command center in Charlottesville.

The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation’s Breaks Interstate Park Law Enforcement Rangers assisted local jurisdictions with flood response in Buchanan County.

The Virginia Department of Health is monitoring the commonwealth’s public health issues related to the current inclement weather.

PERSONAL PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS

As communities continue to face flooding concerns, below are some flood safety and preparedness tips.

Failing to evacuate flooded areas, entering flood waters, or remaining after a flood has passed can result in injury or death. Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States.

Remember that flash floods can come with no warning. They can cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings, and create landslides.

Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown!

Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.

Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.

Stay away from downed wires and do not approach or touch trees or limbs that are entangled with wires as they could be extremely dangerous. If those are in state maintained roadways, VDOT crews must await the power company to remove any electrical hazard before addressing downed trees or other roadway debris.

Power outages are affecting traffic signals in some areas. Treat all inoperable traffic signals as four-way stops.

For questions or to report hazardous road conditions such as flooding or downed trees and powerlines, contact VDOT’s 24-hour Customer Service Center by visiting	my.vdot.virginia.govor calling 800-FOR-ROAD (367-7623).

Check roadway conditions by using VDOT’s free 511 mobile app, which offers information about road conditions, traffic, incidents, construction and congestion as well as access to traffic cameras, weather and more. Information is also available at 511.vdot.virginia.gov or by calling 511 while in Virginia.

Visit VDOT’s Districts webpage for more details in your area.

Determine how best to protect yourself based on the type of flooding.

Evacuate if told to do so.

Move to higher ground or a higher floor.

Stay where you are.

How to prepare for flooding:

Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts.

If flash flooding is a risk in your location, then monitor potential signs, such as heavy rain.

Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response.

Gather supplies in case you have to leave immediately, or if services are cut off. Keep in mind each person’s specific needs, including medication. Don’t forget the needs of pets. Obtain extra batteries and charging devices for phones and other critical equipment.

Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies.

Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters.

What to do during a flood:

Depending on where you are, and the impact and the warning time of flooding, go to the safe location that you previously identified.

If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Never drive around barricades. Local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of flooded areas.

Listen to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions.

Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown!

Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning.

If your vehicle is trapped in rapidly moving water, then stay inside. If water is rising inside the vehicle, then seek refuge on the roof.

If trapped in a building, then go to its highest level. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising floodwater. Go on the roof only if necessary. Once there, signal for help.

Be safe after a flood:

Listen to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.

Avoid driving, except in emergencies.

Wear heavy gloves and boots during clean up.

Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off the electricity to prevent electric shock.

Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris and be contaminated. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.

Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.

Cleaning up from a flood:

Personal safety is always the highest priority when entering buildings damaged by floodwater.

Check for structural damage before re-entering your home to avoid being trapped in a building collapse.

Keep power off until an electrician has inspected your system for safety.

Turn off the gas. Be alert for gas leaks.

Look before you step. After a flood, the ground and floors are covered with debris, including broken bottles and nails. Floors and stairs that have been covered with mud can be very slippery.

Take photos of any floodwater in your home and of damaged items for insurance purposes.

Rescue the most valuable items but never attempt to salvage belongings at the expense of your own safety.

Wear long sleeves, sturdy shoes or waterproof boots, and plastic or rubber gloves during cleanup.

Wash your hands often with soap and clean water or use a hand-cleaning gel with alcohol in it.

Mold can form within 48 hours; you will need to work fast. If you do encounter extensive mold, use protective gear such as gloves, goggles, and an N95 or N100 face mask, available at most hardware stores.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers guidelines for mold cleanup after floods.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a number of helpful resources, about hazards you may encounter when cleaning up inside and outside your home.

Emergency Alerts

These days, emergency alerts can reach you in so many ways–WEA (Wireless Emergency Alerts) come to your cell phone, EAS (Emergency Alert System) on TV and Radio, NOAA weather radio alerts, mobile apps and more. It’s important to have several different ways you can receive emergency alerts, and to be armed with the knowledge you need before an emergency happens.

Know the current forecast and get alerted for any watches, warnings, or advisories on the National Weather Service’s website

Download FEMA app and local news apps for severe weather alerts

Sign up to receive alerts on your phone, tune in to your local weather station, or listen to your NOAA Weather Radio

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wewj551q0o,"At least 10 people have died as torrential downpours over the weekend drenched parts of the south-eastern US, submerging roads and houses. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said nine people have died in his state, after making an emergency disaster declaration. About 1,000 people stranded in flood waters had to be rescued, he also said on Sunday. The same areas could now be affected by drier but colder conditions, and the risk of snow, ice and significant disruption - according to BBC forecaster John Hutchinson. The other death over the weekend was in Georgia, where a man lying in his bed was struck by an uprooted tree that crashed into his home. Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina were under some type of storm-related alert over the weekend. Almost all of those states also suffered catastrophic damage in September from Hurricane Helene. Hundreds of thousands of homes ended up without power - a number that reduced to tens of thousands early on Monday, according to monitoring site Poweroutage.us. Some parts of Kentucky received up to 6in (15cm) of rain, National Weather Service (NWS) figures show, resulting in widespread flooding issues. The rapid influx of rain caused river levels to rise quickly and trapped vehicles in feet of water, images posted online show. Hundreds of roads were closed. Among those who died in the state were a mother and her seven-year-old child, and a 73-year-old man. A resident of rain-lashed Knott County told CNN he was anxious he would ""lose everything again"", as he was still rebuilding his home from devastating flooding two years previously. Danny Laferty told the broadcaster the type of flooding he had seen in recent years was ""different"". Beshear said that he had written to the White House requesting an emergency disaster declaration and federal funds for affected areas. President Donald Trump approved the declaration on Sunday, authorising the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) - which he has suggested abolishing - to co-ordinate disaster relief efforts. In Obion County, Tennessee, heavy rains caused a levee to break, ""resulting in rapid onset flooding"", according to an X account for the local National Weather Service (NWS) station. The town of Rives along the Obion River, with a population of about 300 people, was deluged from the breached flood barrier. Footage showed brown water rushing over rocks and past trees, as rescue workers in red boats passed flooded homes. Steve Carr, the Obion County mayor, declared a state of emergency himself, ordering mandatory evacuations in Rives. Meanwhile, West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey issued his own state of emergency in more than a dozen counties over the weekend. Kristi Noem, head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees Fema, said she had been in contact with the governors of affected states. ""While emergency management is best led by local authorities, we reinforced that DHS stands ready to take immediate action to offer resources and support,"" Noem said. The same weather system is now bringing heavy snow to parts of Canada. Meanwhile, the NWS warns that arctic air could bring record-breaking cold and dangerous wind chills to the central US this week.",At least 10 dead in US floods and heavy rain,Brandon Drenon,BBC News,2025-02-16T15:51:10,2025-02-17T06:21:02,gemini-2.0-flash

State broadcaster CCTV reported that the 330-metre (1,080ft) floating production storage and offloading unit (FPSO) would be delivered at the end of this month. The unit, developed by state-owned Cosco Ocean Shipping Heavy Industry Company, is designed to carry carbon capture and storage equipment and has a production capacity of up to 120,000 barrels of crude oil a day. It is unique in that it not only captures the carbon dioxide it releases, but also generates electricity from the heat of the exhaust gases, achieving the twin goals of environmental protection and energy savings. The technology “marks an important step for China in the field of offshore carbon capture”, CCTV reported. Oil and gas production releases a large amount of carbon dioxide each year. According to the International Energy Agency, the extraction, transport and processing of oil and gas produced 5.1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, accounting for around 15 per cent of total global energy-related emissions. However, it highlighted a number of measures that could help mitigate the problem, such as the use of low-emission electricity at upstream facilities and the use of carbon capture technologies.",China unveils world’s first oil production ship with carbon capture facilities,Dannie Peng,South China Morning Post,2025-02-16T13:30:08,2025-02-16T13:30:08,gemini-2.0-flash

The heavy rain Saturday evening has caused a levee there to break, and floodwaters are pouring into the surrounding area. Emergency officials are calling it a life-threatening situation. ""It’s worse than I have seen it before. It’s truly a life-threatening event,"" Rives Fire Chief Campbell Rice said. The small-town community of Rives, Tenn., looks more like a lake as rising floodwaters swallow lawns and cars Sunday afternoon. ""We had the saturated ground, and the rivers were all full. And just all of a sudden we were inundated with water,"" Rice said. Obion County Mayor Steve Carr issued a mandatory evacuation for people living in Rives due to the rising water and no electricity. ""If anybody tries to stay there, they are not going to have any electricity or heat, and we are about to have subfreezing temperatures moving in tonight, so it is going to be a very dangerous situation,"" he said. Mayor Carr, made the declaration in a post to his Facebook page, saying: According to a post on their X page, the National Weather Service in Memphis said the levee near Rives in Obion County had failed Sunday morning, resulting in ""rapid onset flooding of the town of Rives and surrounding areas."" Water rescues are now underway as emergency crews take boats door to door. The Millington Fire Department said it sent a water rescue team of six people and equipment to Rives, adding that additional water rescue teams from Collierville, Tipton County and Madison County had been dispatched as well. ""Fire administration was notified at 7:30 this morning of extensive flooding in the area, and the request for water teams was issued,"" the department wrote in a post to X. ""The teams have arrived in the area and have boats in the water conducting recon missions of flooded properties in that community."" ""We did have some folks that have gotten cold and wet, and they’ve been taken to the hospital for treatment, but we’ve had no serious injuries or deaths, so we are thankful for that,"" Carr said.

https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-warns-of-russian-military-buildup-potential-nato-threat-in-2026/,"Russia is possibly preparing for a major military escalation, potentially targeting NATO countries next year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said that Russia plans to deploy 15 divisions, totaling 100,000 to 150,000 troops, primarily inBelarus, a Kyiv Independent journalist reported from the event. While the buildup could focus onUkraine, he cautioned thatRussian forcesmight shift toward Poland or the Baltics, raising concerns about a broader conflict with NATO. ""Based on all the information I've gathered from intelligence and other sources, I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is preparing for war againstNATOcountries next year,"" Zelensky said, but added he ""canâ	 be 100 percent certain."" ""Just like in 2022, they could move forward towards Ukraine, or they could go to Poland or the Baltics. And I believe this is his idea,"" he said. ""God bless, we will stop this crazy guy,"" Zelensky added. The president also warned that without NATO membership, Ukraine must build a self-sufficientmilitarycapable of defending its sovereignty. ""This means the appropriate NATO weaponry and a sufficient number of our Ukrainian soldiers,"" he said. According to Zelensky, Ukraine would require an army numbering 1.5 millionsoldiers. Last month, he said the current total of those serving in Ukraine's armed forces was 880,000. This statement comes as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the U.S. does not consider Ukraine's NATO accession a ""realistic outcome"" of negotiations. U.S. President Donald Trump choed thisstance, saying that he does not believe Ukraine joining the alliance is practical. Zelenskyearlier reported that Ukraine fields 110 brigades, while Russia has 220 brigades and plans to expand to 250 this year.Europe, including U.S. troops stationed there, has only about 82 combat brigades.

Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said the day previously that Europe would not be directly involved in peace talks. A new European special envoy, Stubb said, would help focus European efforts and give them a voice in such talks. ""If there is a negotiating table, I think we need to do something similar to what was done in Kosovo. Europe needs to have a special envoy,"" Stubb said.

Earlier, Politico reported that U.S. officials were heading to Saudi Arabia to meet with Russian representatives for talks meant to lay the ground work for a potential summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kyiv was not invited and was even surprised by the announced meeting in Saudi Arabia, causing alarm that negotiations to end Russia's nearly three year invasion will happen without Ukraine's involvement. Croation Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic voiced a similar sentiment as Stubb, saying that Europe needs a strong representative in negotiations, Reuters reported.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4jj0p5jdo,"A stabbing in Austria that killed a 14-year-old boy and wounded five others was an Islamist attack, Austrian officials have said. The attack took place on Saturday at Villach, a town near the border with Italy and Slovenia, and three of those who were injured remain in intensive care, authorities said. A 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker, who was detained at the scene, has been charged with murder and attempted murder. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said an Islamic State group flag had been found in the suspect's apartment, while state police chief Michaela Kohlweiss said he had sworn allegiance to the group. Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Karner said this was an ""Islamist attack with IS links by an attacker who, according to the investigations so far, was obviously radicalised online, via the internet, within a very short space of time"". ""So those in a position of responsibility, the police, the authorities, must draw the necessary conclusions from that."" Karner said the suspect had a valid residence permit, no criminal record, and had not previously attracted the attention of authorities. Authorities previously said the suspect had a temporary residence permit and was waiting for a decision on his asylum application. The attack took place around 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) near the town's main square. On Sunday, officials confirmed the ages of those who were injured: Two 15-year-olds, with the other victims aged 28, 32 and 36. Five of them are Austrian nationals and one is Turkish. Three are in intensive care, one is in a stable condition and another is receiving outpatient treatment. A delivery worker, also a Syrian man, who had driven his vehicle at the attacker helped prevent more injuries, police said. The attack comes amid a national debate over asylum laws and an election last year that saw the far-right Freedom Party come out on top for the first time. The party has failed to form a coalition government, leaving Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen weighing up whether to call a snap election, form a minority government or invite other parties or a group of experts to try and form an administration. Herbert Kickl, the head of the Freedom Party, seized on the Villach attack, saying on Saturday that Austria needs a ""rigorous crackdown on asylum"". On Sunday, Karner said there needed to be ""legal reforms"" for police and authorities and called for screenings of certain groups, such as asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan.","Austria attack that killed teen linked to IS, officials say",Alex Therrien,BBC News,2025-02-16T06:41:26,2025-02-16T08:47:01,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/congo-m23-rebels-bukavu-southkivu-14527185304baa9a5e40eff4cfccba85,"BUKAVU, Congo (AP) — Rwanda-backed rebelshave occupied a second major city in mineral-rich eastern Congo, the government said Sunday, as M23 rebels confirmed they were in the city to restore order after it was abandoned by Congolese forces. The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes the M23, said in a statement that its fighters “decided to assist the population of Bukavu” in addressing its security challenges under the “old regime” in the city of 1.3 million people. “Our forces have been working to restore the security for the people and their property, much to the satisfaction of the entire population,” alliance spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said in a statement. The rebels sawlittle resistance from government forcesagainst the unprecedented expansion of their reach afteryears of fighting. Congo’s government vowed to restore order in Bukavu but there was no sign of soldiers. Many were seen fleeing on Saturday alongside thousands of civilians. The M23 are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo’s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth that’s critical for much of the world’s technology. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the United Nations experts. The fighting has displaced more than 6 million people in the region, creating the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Rebels vow to ‘clean up’ disorder Bernard Maheshe Byamungu, one of the M23 leaders who has been sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council for rights abuses, stood in front of the South Kivu governor’s office in Bukavu and told residents they have been living in a “jungle.” “We are going to clean up the disorder left over from the old regime,” Byamungu said, as some in the small crowd of young men cheered the rebels on to “go all the way to Kinshasa,” Congo’s capital, nearly 1,000 miles away. Congo’s communications ministry in a statement on social media acknowledged for the first time that Bukavu had been “occupied” and said the national government was “doing everything possible to restore order and territorial integrity” in the region. One Bukavu resident, Blaise Byamungu, said the rebels marched into the city that had been “abandoned by all the authorities and without any loyalist force.” “Is the government waiting for them to take over other towns to take action? It’s cowardice,” Byamungu added. Fears of regional escalation Unlike in 2012, when the M23 briefly seized Goma and withdrew after international pressure, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power. The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. The M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the militia group is “fully integrated” into the Congolese military, which denies it. But the new face of the M23 in the region — Corneille Nangaa — is not Tutsi, giving the group “a new, more diverse, Congolese face, as M23 has always been seen as a Rwanda-backed armed group defending Tutsi minorities,” according to Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol. Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi, whose government on Saturday asserted that Bukavu remained under its control, has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo’s forces were being supported in Goma by troops from South Africa and in Bukavu by troops from Burundi. But Burundi’s president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest on social media his country would not retaliate in the fighting. The conflict was high on the African Union summit’s agenda in Ethiopia over the weekend, with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warning it risked spiraling into a regional conflagration. Still, African leaders and the international community have been reluctant to take decisive action against M23 or Rwanda, which has one of Africa’s most powerful militaries. Most continue to call for a ceasefire and a dialogue between Congo and the rebels. ___ Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria.",Rwanda-backed rebels reach the center of east Congo’s Bukavu,"Chinedu Asadu, Pascal Cinamula, Janvier Barhahiga",AP News,2025-02-16T09:56:18,2025-02-17T06:16:39,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4egp7lwno,"Mouldy half-finished food on bunk beds, discarded military uniforms and abandoned weapons - these are the remnants of an abrupt retreat from this base that once belonged to Iran and its affiliated groups in Syria. The scene tells a story of panic. The forces stationed here fled with little warning, leaving behind a decade-long presence that unravelled in mere weeks. Iran was Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most critical ally for more than 10 years. It deployed military advisers, mobilised foreign militias, and invested heavily in Syria's war. Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) built deep networks of underground bases, supplying arms and training to thousands of fighters. For Iran, this was also part of its ""security belt"" against Israel. We are near Khan Shaykhun town in Idlib province. Before Assad's regime fell on 8 December, it was one of the key strategic locations for the IRGC and its allied groups. From the main road, the entrance is barely visible, hidden behind piles of sand and rocks. A watchtower on a hilltop, still painted in the colours of the Iranian flag, overlooks the base. A receipt notebook confirms the base's name: The Position of Martyr Zahedi -  named after Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander who was assassinated in an alleged Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria on 1 April, 2024. The supplies recently ordered - we found receipts for chocolates, rice, cooking oil - suggest daily life continued here until the last moments. But now the base has new occupants - two armed Uyghur fighters from Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist militant group whose leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has become the new interim president of Syria. The Uyghurs arrived suddenly in a military vehicle, asking for our media accreditation. ""Iranians were here. They all fled,"" one of them says, speaking in his mother tongue, a dialect of Turkish. ""Whatever you see here is from them. Even these onions and the leftover foods."" Boxes full of fresh onions in the courtyard have now germinated. The base is a labyrinth of tunnels dug deep into white rocky hills. There are bunk beds in some rooms with no windows. The roof of one of the corridors is draped in fabric in the colours of the Iranian flag and there are a few Persian books on a rocky shelf. They left behind documents containing sensitive information. All in Persian, they have details of fighters' personal information, military personnel codes, home addresses, spouses' names and mobile phone numbers in Iran. From the names, it's clear that several fighters in this base were from the Afghan brigade that was formed by Iran to fight in Syria. Sources linked to Iran-backed groups told BBC Persian that the base houses mainly Afghan forces accompanied by Iranian ""military advisers"" and their Iranian commanders. Tehran's main justification for its military involvement in Syria was ""to fight against jihadi groups"" and to protect ""Shia holy shrines"" against radical Sunni militants. It created paramilitary groups of mainly Afghan, Pakistani and Iraqi fighters. Yet, when the final moment came, Iran was unprepared. Orders for retreat reached some bases at the very last moment. ""Developments happened so fast,"" a senior member of an Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary group tells me. ""The order was to just take your backpack and leave."" Multiple sources close to the IRGC told the BBC that most of the forces had to flee to Iraq, and some were ordered to go to Lebanon or Russian bases to be evacuated from Syria by the Russians. An HTS fighter, Mohammad al Rabbat, had witnessed the group's advance from Idlib to Aleppo and Syria's capital Damascus. He says they thought their operation would take ""about a year"" and best, they'd ""capture Aleppo in three to six months"". But to their surprise, they entered Aleppo in a matter of days. The regime's rapid downfall was brought about by a chain of events after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel. That attack led to an escalation of Israeli air strikes against the IRGC and Iran-backed groups in Syria and a war against another key Iranian ally – the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose leader was killed in an air strike. This ""situation of psychological collapse"" for Iran and Hezbollah was central to their downfall, says 35-year-old fighter Rabbat. But the most crucial blow came from within: there was a rift between Assad and his Iran-linked allies, he says. ""There was a complete breakdown of trust and military co-operation between them. IRGC-linked groups were blaming Assad of betrayal and believing that he is giving up their locations to Israel."" As we pass through Khan Shaykhun, we come across a street painted in the colours of the Iranian flag. It leads to a school building that was being used as an Iranian headquarters. On the wall at the entrance of the toilets, slogans read: ""Down with Israel"" and ""Down with the USA"". It was evident that these headquarters were also evacuated at short notice. We found documents classified as ""highly sensitive"". Abdullah, 65, and his family are among the very few locals who stayed and lived here alongside the IRGC-led groups. He says this life was hard. His house is only a few metres away from the headquarters and in between, there are deep trenches with barbed wire. ""Movement at night was prohibited,"" he says. His neighbour's home was turned into a military post. ""They sat there with their guns pointing at the road, treating us all as suspects,"" he recalls. Most of the fighters didn't even speak Arabic, he says. ""They were Afghans, Iranians, Hezbollah. But we referred to them all as Iranians because Iran was controlling them."" Abdullah's wife Jourieh says she is happy that the ""Iranian militias"" have left, but still remembers the ""stressful"" moment before their withdrawal. She had thought they would be trapped in crossfire as Iran-backed groups were fortifying their positions and getting ready to fight, but then ""they just vanished in a few hours"". ""This was an occupation. Iranian occupation,"" says Abdo who, like others, has just returned here with his family after 10 years. His house had also become a military base. I observed this anger towards Iran and a softer attitude towards Russia in many conversations with Syrians. I asked Rabbat, the HTS fighter, why this was. ""Russians were dropping bombs from the sky and other than that, they were in their bases while Iranians and their militias were on the ground interacting. People were feeling their presence, and many weren't happy with it,"" he explained. This feeling is reflected in Syria's new rulers' policy towards Iran. The new authorities have put a ban on Iranian nationals, alongside Israelis, entering Syria. But there is no such ban against Russians. Iran's embassy, which was stormed by angry protesters after the fall of the regime, remains closed. The reaction of Iranian officials towards developments in Syria has been contradictory. While supreme leader Ali Khamenei called on ""Syrian youths"" to ""resist"" those who ""have brought instability"" to Syria, Iran's foreign ministry has taken a more balanced view. It says the country ""backs any government supported by the Syrian people"". In one of his first interviews, Syria's new leader Sharaa described their victory over Assad as an ""end of the Iranian project"". But he hasn't ruled out having a ""balanced"" relationship with Tehran. For the moment, though, Iran is not welcome in Syria. After years of expanding its military presence, everything Tehran built is now in ruins, both on the battlefield and, it seems, in the eyes of a large part of Syria's public. Back at the abandoned base, Iran's military expansion was still under way even in the last days. Next to the camp were more tunnels under construction, apparently the beginnings of a field hospital. The cement on the walls was still wet and the paint fresh. But left behind now is evidence of a brief fight - a few bullet shells and a military uniform covered with blood. The delay comes after Washington imposed new sanctions targeting Iran on Wednesday. The sectarian violence involving Islamist factions, security forces and Druze gunmen is another sign of the fragile security situation. The strikes were south of Damascus, where Syrian security forces say they are battling gunmen from the religious minority. The interior minister said ""some individuals deemed responsible"" for Saturday's blast at Shahid Rajaee are being questioned.

Speaking hours after US President Donald Trump again threatened to impose tariffs on Taiwanese semiconductors, Lai said the government would act prudently, strengthen communications with the US and promote greater mutual understanding. Lai also touted an initiative to promote semiconductor supply chain partnerships for global democracies, saying that Taiwan would collaborate with the US and other democratic partners to facilitate a more resilient and diversified semiconductor supply chain. Such a supply chain would form the basis for a global alliance on chips for artificial intelligence (AI) and ensure industries in democratic nations have access to high-end chips, he said. This would open up a new era of growth for the international semiconductor industry, he added. Taiwan will continue to highlight that bilateral cooperation is mutually beneficial, and to communicate and negotiate closely with Washington to help the US administration better understand that Taiwan is an indispensable partner in rebuilding US manufacturing and consolidating its technological leadership, Lai said. The Executive Yuan will explore all possible trade opportunities with the US, and hopes to balance bilateral trade by stepping up investments in the US and purchasing US goods, he said. Taiwan has always been one of the most reliable trade partners of the US, as well as one of the most essential cooperative partners of US companies in the semiconductor industry, he added. Taiwan has significantly increased its investment in the US, which was valued at US$100 billion and had created nearly 400,000 jobs as of last year, Lai said. Taiwanese investment in the US in 2023 and last year accounted for at least 40 percent of the nation’s total foreign investment, he said. That far exceeded Taiwanese investment in China, which accounted for 11 percent in 2023 and only 8 percent last year, he added.

The testimonies of Sagui Dekel-Chen, Iair Horn, and Sasha Troufanov were shared with N12 and KAN. N12 reported that Hamas wrongly insisted that some of the hostages were soldiers, using continual interrogation and torture to try to obtain intelligence from them. The hostages were held in extremely unhealthy environments, including in tunnels and hiding places, which were full of lice, bedbugs, mold, and mildew. They also received almost no food and drank only salt water, which was not fit for drinking. N12 added that because many of the hostages were wounded by Hamas terrorists and did not receive proper medical treatment, they may have to undergo surgery. Before their release, the terrorists forced the hostages to write letters of gratitude while documenting them. Horn was held captive for a while with his brother Eitan, who remains in Hamas captivity. He spent most of his time in the Hamas tunnels but was held with other hostages, so he was able to provide Israel with signs of life from those he was held with. Dekel-Chen was interrogated throughout his time in captivity, including through physical torture, N12 said. This has resulted in physical scars on his body. KAN added that he was shot in the right shoulder on October 7 but told IDF officers after his release to leave the wound alone as “the most important thing is for me to meet my family now.” He was also unaware of his family’s fate, cut off from all means of communication for nearly 15 months. During the hostage release, Hamas told him that his wife had given birth to a daughter while he was in captivity, which he didn’t believe until it was confirmed by the IDF. Troufanov was held alone throughout his time in captivity, KAN claimed. He was told by the IDF after his release that his father, Vitaly, had been murdered and burst into tears. Dekel-Chen, Horn, and Troufanov were all held in Khan Yunis in tunnels up until very recently when they were moved to apartments above ground.",Three released hostages reveal horrific details of Hamas captivity,MATHILDA HELLER,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-15T19:43:00,2025-02-16T13:17:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2483zrz0zo,"Imposing US tariffs on UK steel would be ""negative"" for both countries, the business secretary has said. Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK and US have a ""mutual interest"" in negotiating an exemption from President Donald Trump's plans for the 25% import tax, which could come into force in March. He said the UK was in a different trading position to other countries and could offer ""very specialised"" steel and aluminium exports the US needs like Navy submarine casings made in Sheffield, while tariffs would push up costs for US taxpayers. Reynolds' comments came after the government promised up to Â£2.5bn in support for the UK steel industry. President Trump has said his tariffs would be enforced ""without exceptions or exemptions"". However, Reynolds told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that imposing them on UK steel ""would be negative for ourselves, it would be negative for the US as well"". He said he has had ""some very constructive conversations with key people in the Trump administration recognising our relationship is different"", including the US special envoy to the UK. The minister told the programme he thought there was a basis for ""constructive engagement"" between the UK and US but ""I'm not saying it's easy"". He added: ""I appreciate they have a mandate for changing how they approach the issues of trade, but we have got a different argument, a different story to tell, to the EU or to China in relation to our trading relationships."" The government has already said it would not retaliate immediately to the tariffs announced by Trump. UK Steel, which represents the industry, has said the tariffs would be a ""devastating blow"" that would damage the sector's Â£400m-a-year contribution to UK-US trade. The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. But there are concerns within the industry the tariffs might not just hinder exports to the US, but also lead to excess steel being ""dumped"" in the UK. This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut. Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the ""uncertainty"" the steel industry faced due to US tariffs was something the government ""has been entirely silent on when instead they should be talking to the US, our closest trading partner"". On Sunday, the government launched a consultation on its Plan for Steel, which will look at ways to reverse long-term issues facing the industry - including cheap imports flooding the domestic market. The UK steel industry has faced heavy job losses in recent years. Tata Steel is replacing old blast furnaces with an electric arc furnace - which is less energy-intensive and environmentally friendlier - at its site in Port Talbot, Wales. Traditional steelmaking at the siteceased in September,resulting in 2,800 job cuts. British Steel announced in 2023 it wouldclose blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, and unveiled plans to roll out an electric arc furnace, which requires fewer workers to keep it going, with2,000 jobs under threat. Asked about the potential job losses in Scunthorpe, Reynolds accepted that there would be a ""reduction in head count"" with the introduction of new technologies, but he said more jobs could be created if demand for UK steel was increased. The government's plan will address issues that have been ""holding the industry back for too long"", the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) said, including: The consultation will also examine electricity costs for steel companies ""to make the UK competitive globally"", but the government has not yet made a firm commitment to reduce energy bills. Griffiths said he looked forward to seeing a detailed plan, but added ""a clear part must be steps to reduce the cost of energy which is placing an intolerable strain on UK steel"". Help for the sector will be available through the National Wealth Fund, which partners the government with the private sector and local authorities to finance infrastructure and other projects. The government says this financial assistance could benefit Scotland, as well as areas of England such as Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, Rotherham and Redcar which have ""a strong history of steel production"". But the DBT said it was ""wasting no time"" supporting UK steel, pointing tothe government's backing an expansion of Heathrow Airport, which it said would require 400,000 tonnes of steel. The GMB union said the government's plan to support the ""beleaguered"" steel industry provided ""desperately needed"" funding after ""years of dithering"". ""As the world becomes more volatile, primary domestic steel making capacity is vital for both our economy and domestic security,"" the union's national secretary Andy Prendergast added. Gareth Stace, director-general of UK Steel, said the government's commitment to the industry was ""both vital and welcome"". Information gathered in the consultation will be used to help form a ""steel strategy"", to be launched in the spring. Stace added a robust strategy ""has the power to reverse the sector's decline, particularly as we face increasing competition from imports benefiting from more favourable business conditions"". The Liberal Democrats have said the government urgently needs to prepare for retaliatory tariff. Deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the UK steel industry was being left ""dangerously exposed"" to the ""devastating damage"" Trump's tariffs could inflict.","Trump steel tariffs negative for UK and US, says Reynolds",David Mercer & Vishala Sri-Pathma,BBC News,2025-02-15T19:56:02.196,2025-02-16T11:03:02.032,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250215001300320?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, Feb. 15 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Saturday reaffirmed its commitment to bolstering its defensive capabilities to deter what it calls ""provocative attempts"" by South Korea and the United States, the North's state media reported Saturday. 

 ""The DPRK's bolstering of its self-defensive capabilities is an essential requirement for deterring rivals' ever-increasing various provocative attempts and ensuring the security of the state,"" read a press statement of Pyongyang's defense policy chief, released by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

 DPRK is the acronym of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.


 The statement was released a day after the commander of the U.S. Northern Command, Gen. Gregory Guillot, said before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that the North's newest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) could pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland and overwhelm its defenses.

 Guillot said Pyongyang may be moving toward producing new ICBMs capable of striking North America. 

 Pyongyang's defense official slammed the U.S. general's remarks, accusing the U.S. of falsely charging North Korea of making ""threats"" that are ""nonexistent.""

 ""The U.S. describing this as a 'threat' only proves that it is hostile to the DPRK,"" the official said, noting the U.S. is trying to justify its ""adventurous military ambitions.""

 ""It is just self-defensive right of a sovereign state to steadily develop the self-defense capability,"" he added. 

 ""The armed forces of the DPRK will as ever fully deter and control all kinds of challenges and threats from its rival countries by dint of powerful self-defense capability and faithfully discharge their mission for reliably defending peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.""

 The North's defense policy chief also accused the U.S. of building a missile defense system aimed at preemptively attacking other countries and weaponizing outer space.

 He also condemned the U.S. nuclear submarine's recent trip to the Korean Peninsula and information sharing among Seoul, Washington and Tokyo, as well as Seoul's plan to hold joint military and space-related drills with the U.S.

Some 10,000 people were estimated to have gathered at Geumnam-ro, the city's central avenue, to participate in a massive prayer event, organized by a conservative Christian group, to oppose Yoon's ouster over his short-lived martial law bid in December. Geumnam-ro is the historic street symbolizing the May 18 pro-democracy uprising in Gwangju in 1980. Many people were killed and injured in Gwangju as the military brutally cracked down on protesters who rose up against the ruling junta led by Chun Doo-hwan. Saturday's protest came as the Constitutional Court has been holding Yoon's impeachment trials over his botched martial law bid. Yoon was also detained last month on charges of insurrection over his martial law bid. His supporters called for Yoon's immediate release from prison or verifying the election fraud allegations, cited by Yoon as a main reason for declaring martial law. Meanwhile, protesters calling for Yoon's ouster also gathered at Geumnam-ro, just across walls of police buses that were set up to prevent potential clashes between demonstrators from opposite ends of the political spectrum. Around 20,000 protesters, estimated by organizers, participated in the rally, chanting slogans, including ""Uphold Yoon's impeachment"" and ""Out, far-right forces."" Protesters in support of Yoon's removal denounced Yoon's supporters for using Geumnam-ro as a venue to advocate his martial law imposition. ""There is a saying that South Korea's democracy has grown, fed by the blood of Gwangju. We cannot tolerate (Yoon's supporters) defending his martial law bid and supporting the mastermind of insurrection at Geumnam-ro,"" Hwang Hyun-pil, a YouTuber and Korean history instructor, said.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/shin-bet-launches-inquiry-into-netanyahu-aides-ties-with-qatar/,"The Shin Bet said Saturday it has begun probing reports on the alleged ties between advisers to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar, the main financial backer of the terror group Hamas. In response to a query from The Democrats MK Gilad Kariv, the security service said that as the body responsible for “preventing espionage threats,” it has begun investigating the protection of state secrets in the Prime Minister’s Office and the personnel surrounding “protected persons,” a euphemism for the most senior Israeli officials. Responding to the development, Netanyahu’s office put out a statement accusing the Shin Bet of selective enforcement by not probing the premier’s political rivals. “We are used to false accusations about the Prime Minister’s Office,” the statement said, dismissing the allegations against the prime minister’s aides as “fake news.” The Shin Bet’s confirmation of the inquiry came after Hebrew media reported Friday that Eli Feldstein, Netanyahu’s former spokesman, was paid by Doha to feed top Israeli journalists pro-Qatar stories. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories According to Channel 12 news, Feldstein’s ties with Qatar, which serves as a mediator of the current hostage-ceasefire deal because of its influence over Hamas, emerged during an investigation that led to him being charged in November with harming national security in a case involving the theft and leaking of classified IDF documents. Eli Feldstein, a spokesman in the Prime Minister’s Office accused of leaking stolen IDF intelligence classified documents, arrives for a court hearing at the District Court in Tel Aviv, January 14, 2025. (Avshalom Sassoni) Feldstein’s alleged ties to Qatar, however, were left unexplored by investigators. The network cited a former defense official excoriating investigators for the reported oversight. The TV report also said Feldstein worked for Qatar via an international firm contracted by the Persian Gulf state. Meanwhile, Channel 13 news reported that Feldstein was hired by a Qatar-employed US strategist, who had interviewed several well-known publicists for the job. The reports prompted calls for a probe into Qatar’s influence in the Prime Minister’s Office, while The Democrats chairman Yair Golan demanded Netanyahu and his staff be investigated for treason. “It is not possible for people who have financial interests with a foreign country to be involved in managing matters critical to Israel’s national security,” Golan said in a statement welcoming the Shin Bet probe as ” a necessary step,” while calling for everybody involved in the matter to be removed from government service “immediately.” “The Shin Bet must thoroughly investigate not only the prime minister’s associates, but also the prime minister himself: Was he aware of these connections? Did he approve of them? And perhaps even worse — did he himself receive funds, directly or indirectly? This investigation must not be allowed to be hidden or scuttled. This is about Israel’s security and the lives of the hostages,” he stated. Israel has no diplomatic relations with Qatar, which hosts Hamas’s leadership. For years, with Netanyahu’s approval, Qatar transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to the terror group in Gaza. Qatar, along with Egypt and the United States, mediated the current ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, following 15 months of fighting that began on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages. It also helped mediate November 2023’s weeklong hostage-truce deal. Reports of Feldstein’s ties to Doha were first published on Monday, and follow reports in November that top Netanyahu aides Jonatan Urich and Yisrael Einhorn did public relations work for Qatar ahead of the 2022 World Cup there.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-943c9a5e-32c0-4eae-8abb-4d9c4c6eae1e,"President Donald Trump has made repeated claims that China “operates” the Panama Canal in recent weeks and has threatened to take back the waterway to block what he sees as Beijing’s increasing influence. A BBC Verify analysis shows that the US remains the main user of the canal, but Chinese involvement in infrastructure projects around the waterway - which is operated directly by Panama - has grown in recent years. Up to 14,000 ships use the 51-mile (82km) passage each year. It links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the Central American country, avoiding an otherwise lengthy and costly trip around South America. The waterway cuts the amount of time it takes goods to flow from Shenzhen in China to the US east coast, or between San Francisco and New York, by weeks. After Panama signed up to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2017 - where Beijing invests in infrastructure across the globe - Chinese companies were more active around the canal. Panama left the partnership earlier this month amid US pressure. However, much of Trump’s ire has been focused on Chinese control over ports which predate the BRI. There are five container ports around the Panama Canal. All of them are operated by foreign companies.  Three of the canal’s main container ports - Colon, Rodman and Manzanillo - are operated by companies based in Singapore, Taiwan and the US.  But much of the US attention has focused on the two biggest, Cristóbal and Balboa. They sit at either end of the canal and have been operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings since 1997.   While the company is a private corporation based outside the Chinese mainland, experts have told the BBC that the Chinese national security law introduced in 2020 could allow China to exercise influence over Hong Kong-based companies in the event of a conflict.  “In terms of the day-to-day, I’m sceptical as to whether there’s a direct line between Beijing and CK Hutchison, but in a time of a crisis or a conflict it would be relatively trivial for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to say we’re going to use the ports,” Henry Ziemer, an Americas specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told the BBC.  This view was echoed by the former commander of the US military’s southern command, Gen Laura J Richardson. She told lawmakers in 2023 that “in any potential global conflict, the PRC [China] could leverage strategic regional ports to restrict US naval and commercial ship access”.  The chairman of CK Hutchison - Victor Li Tzar-kuoi - serves as a member of the national committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), according to his company website.  The CPPCC is China's top political advisory body comprising of thousands of members and is part of the “United Front System” which works to aid government influence domestically and abroad. Its members usually include top corporate figures. BBC Verify approached CK Hutchison Holdings for comment.  While Trump’s attention has focused on Balboa and Cristóbal, Chinese companies have been involved in projects elsewhere around the canal - with one major bridge project attracting some attention.  Three bridges currently cross the canal at various points. Slightly north of the Bridge of the Americas, a Chinese corporation is building the new Fourth Bridge, connecting Panama City to West Panama. This is the site in March 2024. The deal - which the Reuters news agency reported was worth about $1.42bn - has been beset by delays. But satellite images over the past year show development of the bridge has picked up, as seen here in January 2025. US officials have raised concerns over the involvement of Chinese firms in the project. Republican Senator Ted Cruz recently said that the “partially-completed bridge gives China the ability to block the canal without warning”, but did not elaborate as to how he thought the bridge could be used as an obstacle. Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama at the time, visits the site of the Fourth Bridge Project in 2019 Other major projects include the Amador Cruise Terminal built by the China Harbour Engineering Company on the Pacific side of the canal.  And an extension to the Panama City Metro which will run under the south end of the canal is being built by the China Railway Tunnel Group Company.  But while these projects represent some Chinese interests around the canal, Panamanian authorities have shelved several other high profile Chinese-led projects.  Eddie Tapiero, a Panama-based economist, said he believed that around 50% of projects initiated after Panama joined the BRI have been discontinued or suspended. In 2022, a major project intended to develop a new port on Isla Margarita on the Caribbean side of the canal was cancelled. A proposed high-speed rail line across the country from Panama City to David in the west of the country was also shelved after a new government came to power in Panama. And a plan to build a new Chinese embassy on the Amador Causeway Islands - which sit at the gates of the canal - was cancelled in 2018.  Experts who spoke to the BBC have suggested that China’s influence over infrastructure had mainly expanded to fill a gap left by the US in the region.  Mr Tapiero told BBC Verify that US companies were frequently uninterested or uncompetitive in bidding processes compared to Chinese competitors - who he said were often willing to offer finance when seeking deals.  Statistics for foreign direct investment (FDI) - the amount of money countries are investing in another country - paint a similar picture.  China invested $1.4bn in Panama in 2023 - a fourfold increase since the start of the BRI in 2017 - while US investments, although far higher overall, have declined over that same period. Annual investment in Panama From October 2023 to September 2024, shipping to or from China accounted for 21% of the cargo going through the waterway according to figures from the Panama Canal management company. However, the US remains the biggest investor in Panama and the top user of the canal by some distance. Last year, three and half times as much cargo passed through the canal going to and from the US than China. Cargo via the Panama Canal, top 15 countries, Oct 2023 to Sep 2024 Beijing’s influence in Panama may well be on the decline, says Henry Ziemer of the CSIS. The Panamanian authorities have “had a taste of what infrastructure partnership with China looks like, and they are not too pleased with that. It hasn’t delivered the big flashy gains that were promised when they first signed onto the BRI.” “That is why - along with pressure from Washington - the sense is now that Panama is seeking to move away from China.”",Mapping China’s influence around the Panama Canal  - BBC News,"Matt Murphy, Jake Horton and Erwan Rivault",BBC News,2025-02-24T05:05:19,2025-02-24T05:05:19,gemini-2.0-flash

Ramping up his desire for a more muscular Europe, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s nearly three-year fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion has proved that a foundation exists for the creation of a European army — an idea long discussed among some leaders on the continent. “I really believe that time has come,” he said. “The armed forces of Europe must be created.” It’s unclear whether the idea will catch on with European leaders. Zelenskyy has sought greater military and economic support from the European Union for years and repeatedly warned that other parts of Europe could be vulnerable to Russia’s expansionist ambitions. While the bloc — along with the United States — has been one of Kyiv’s strongest backers, pockets of political disagreement over its approach to Moscow and economic realities, including national debt levels that have crimped defense spending, have stood in the way of greater support. Zelenskyy also told The Associated Press on Saturday that he “didn’t let” his ministers sign an agreement with the U.S. on the extraction of minerals in the country, because “it is not ready to protect us, our interest.” Ukraine is hoping to offer rare earth elements essential for many kinds of technology in exchange for continued military aid. Earlier, Zelenskyy alluded to a phone conversation between Trump and Putin this week, after which Trump said that he and Putin would likely meet soon to negotiate a peace deal over Ukraine — breaking with the Biden administration’s harder line against Moscow over Russia’s all-out assault on Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Russia’s Foreign Ministry and the U.S. State Department said Saturday that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken by phone. Rubio reaffirmed Trump’s “commitment to finding an end to the conflict in Ukraine. In addition, they discussed the opportunity to potentially work together on a number of other bilateral issues,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. Trump previously assured Zelenskyy that he would have a seat at the table to end the war, and the Ukrainian leader insisted that Europe should also have one. “Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement, and the same rule should apply to all of Europe,” Zelenskyy said, adding that “not once did (Trump) mention that America needs Europe at the table.” “That says a lot,” he said. “The old days are over when America supported Europe just because it always had.” Europeans likely excluded from Ukraine peace talks European leaders have been trying to make sense of a tough new line from Washington on issues including democracy and Ukraine’s future, as the Trump administration continues to upend trans-Atlantic conventions that have been in place since after World War II. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, all but cut Europeans out of any Ukraine-Russia talks, despite Zelenskyy’s call for Europe to take part. “You can have the Ukrainians, the Russians, and clearly the Americans at the table talking,” Kellogg said at an event hosted by a Ukrainian tycoon. Pressed on whether that meant Europeans won’t be included, he said: “I’m a school of realism. I think that’s not going to happen.” “We need to ensure Ukrainian sovereignty,” he said, before adding: The “European alliance ... are going to be critical to this.” At the conference, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister, described the new U.S. stance as a “moment of truth” that requires European leaders to overcome their differences and unite for a meaningful peace in Ukraine. “This is an existential moment. It’s a moment where Europe has to stand up,” she said. “There won’t be any lasting peace, if it’s not a European-agreed peace.” Iceland’s prime minister, Kristrún Frostadóttir, lamented a lack of clarity from Washington. “People are still not sure what the U.S. wants to do. And I think it would be good if we came out of this conference if they had a clear picture of it,” she said.  German chancellor hits back at Vance Earlier, Scholz said that he was “pleased” at what he called a shared commitment with the United States to “preserving the sovereign independence of Ukraine” and agreed with Trump that the Russia-Ukraine war must end. But Scholz also condemned the new political tack from Washington, affirming his strong stance against the far-right and said his country won’t accept people who “intervene in our democracy.” A day earlier, Vance chastised Europe’s leaders at the conference and suggested that free speech is “in retreat” across the continent. Vance said that no democracy could survive telling millions of voters that their concerns “are invalid or unworthy of even being considered.” He also met with the co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party, which is polling second ahead of Scholz’s own Social Democrats before the Feb. 23 election in Germany. Alluding to Germany’s Nazi past, Scholz said that the longstanding commitment to “Never Again” — a return to the extreme right — wasn’t reconcilable with support for AfD. “We will not accept that people who look at Germany from the outside intervene in our democracy and our elections and in the democratic opinion-forming process in the interest of this party,” he said. “That’s just not done, certainly not amongst friends and allies. We resolutely reject this.” Not all responses from European leaders were negative. President Karin Keller-Sutter of Switzerland, which isn’t an EU member, was quoted by Swiss daily Le Temps as saying Vance had spoken about “values to defend and that we share, like freedom and the possibility for people to express themselves.” ___ Susie Blann reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Jamey Keaten reported from Lyon, France.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/these-are-the-14-hostages-yet-to-be-released-in-phase-one-of-the-gaza-ceasefire/,"With six rounds of hostage-prisoner releases completed in the ongoing Gaza ceasefire deal as of Saturday, there are 14 Israeli hostages still supposed to be set free in the first phase. Days into the truce, which began in January, family members of several hostages slated to be released from Gaza in the coming weeks expressed dread over their loved ones’ fates after Hamas conveyed information saying that eight of the 33 hostages on the original list are dead. Following the release of the information, those families were informed by the military that Hamas’s information aligned with previous assessments and there were dire concerns about their fates. Those on the list, to be returned over the initial period of 42 days that began on January 19, are so-called humanitarian cases: women, children, elderly individuals and the infirm. According to the terms of the ceasefire, the identities of those set to return are to be provided by the terror group 24 hours before each release, though in recent weeks, Hamas has not always met the deadline. As of Saturday, February 15, 70 of the 251 hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 34 confirmed dead by the IDF. The list of hostages left on the list to be released in phase one of the deal includesShiri Silberman Bibas, 33, and her two young sons,Ariel, 5, andKfir, 2.Israel is said to bepressuringmediators to clarify the condition of Bibas and her young sons. Hamas claimed in November 2023 that the three had been killed, which Israel called a “cruel” claim that it could not confirm. Israel has said there is “grave concern” over the fate of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir. The list of remaining hostages to be released in the first stage also includes five older men: Itzik Elgarat, 70Shlomo Mantzur, 86Ohad Yahalomi, 50Oded Lifshitz, 84Tsahi Idan, 50 And another six men under 50: Hisham al-Sayed, 36Omer Wenkert, 23Eliya Cohen, 27Avera Mengistu, 38Tal Shoham, 39Omer Shem-Tov, 22 Al-Sayed and Mengistu have been captive in Gaza for over a decade, after entering the Strip of their own accord. All the others were abducted on October 7, 2023. Hamas has so far released 24 hostages — 19 Israeli civilians and female soldiers, and five Thai nationals — during the ceasefire that began on January 19. The terror group also freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that. In total, Israel has said it will release up to 1,904 Palestinian prisoners — including 737 jailed Palestinians who were not captured in Gaza during the war and some of whom are serving life terms for dozens of murders — in return for the 33 Israeli hostages during the deal’s first phase. The deal’s implementation has been shaky, with Israel and Hamas both accusing each other of violating it at multiple junctures. US President Donald Trump’s controversial proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza fueled further uncertainty on whether the multiphase agreement will hold up. The 19 Israeli hostages who have been released in exchange for Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners and detainees in the deal so far, in six batches, are: Romi Gonen, 23Emily Damari, 27Doron Steinbrecher, 31Liri Albag, 19Karina Ariev, 20Danielle Gilboa, 20Naama Levy, 20Agam Berger, 21Arbel Yehoud, 29Gadi Moshe Mozes, 80Keith Siegel, 65Yarden Bibas, 35Ofer Calderon, 54Or Levy, 34Ohad Ben-Ami, 58Eli Sharabi, 52Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36Iair Horn, 46Sasha Troufanov, 28 The three-phase deal’s later phases are to see negotiations with the stated goal of reaching a “sustainable calm” in the enclave, alongside the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, the release of more Palestinian security prisoners, and an Israeli withdrawal from the Strip. Though talks for the second phase were supposed to commence two weeks ago, the negotiating team that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu initiallysent to Dohareportedly only had a mandate to discuss technical issues about the ongoing initial stage. The families of male hostages who are not set to be released until after the first phase of the deal have expressed deep concern over the delay in talks on the second phase. The war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, when some 3,000 Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and taking 251 hostages, amid many acts of brutality and sexual assault. Aside from hostages released under deals with the Palestinian terror group, eight have been rescued alive by troops, and the bodies of 40 hostages have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors. Hamas is also holding Mengistu and Al-Sayed — the two Israeli civilians who entered the Strip in 2014 and 2015 — as well as the body of an IDF soldier, Hadar Goldin, who was killed in 2014. The body of another IDF soldier, Oren Shaul, also killed in 2014, was recovered from Gaza in January.",These are the 14 hostages yet to be released in phase one of the Gaza ceasefire,"ToI Staff, Agencies",The Times of Israel,2025-02-15T11:36:42,2025-02-18T14:17:27,gemini-2.0-flash

IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi saidon the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that Tehran is increasing its monthly production of 60 percent enriched uranium by almost sevenfold. ""Iran will have about 250 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent by the time the IAEAâ	ms next report is presented in the coming weeks,"" Grossi said on February 14 in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the conference. ""It's clearly a sign that should be taken very seriously. So this is why I believe that we shouldn't be wasting more time. I hope that we can refocus on Iran,"" he said. Earlier this month he called on the Trump administration and Iran to engage in dialogue to advance the nuclear talks, stressing that dialogue is ""absolutely necessary"" to make progress. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said last week that talks with the United States were ""not smart, wise or honorable"" after President Donald Trump restored his ""maximum pressure"" policy toward Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero to push it into a deal that would severely constrain its nuclear program.

https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-cuban-fighters-ukraine-mercenaries/33315782.html,"In a room far behind the front lines in central Ukraine, a Cuban man wearing Russian military fatigues smiles widely as he taps out a rhythm on a table. But his mood soon turns somber. Frank Dario Jarrosay Manfuga, 36, joined Russia's army in January 2024.By March he had been captured by Ukrainian forces, and he is now hoping for a way out of a desperate situation.""I never intended to kill anyone. I never wanted to participate in a war. I have a family,"" said Manfuga, who claimed he was tricked into boarding a Russia-bound plane with the promise of a job in construction.""Maybe some organization could save me,"" he said, adding he has no desire to return to Russia or Cuba.Manfuga's claim that he was duped could not be verified. A former geography teacher who later became a professional musician to increase his income, he is now a captured mercenary.Hisinterview with Schemes, the investigative unit of RFE's Ukrainian Service, was arranged through contacts in the Ukrainian military, which is keen to demonstrate just how widely Russia has cast its net in a search for foreign manpower to bolster the invasion and offset an unpopular conscription drive at home. In Manfuga's case, that distance is more than 9,500 kilometers from Moscow. And he is not alone.""Based on passports obtained by Ukrainian hackers, our own information from Cuba, numerous videos we've seen, and reports of some Cubans killed in combat, we can estimate that around 5,000 Cuban soldiers are fighting for Russia,"" Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, co-founder of the Cuban Democratic Directorate, a U.S.-based NGO advocating for democratic change in communist Cuba, told Schemes. ""This network could not function without the Cuban regime's approval."" If that figure is accurate, it would amount to under half the number of soldiers from North Korea reportedly participating in Russia's war with their government's open backing -- most notably in the effort to counter Ukraine's shock offensive in Russia's Kursk region.But unlike North Koreans, Cuban fighters in Russia have left a significant social media footprint, with many openly embracing the Kremlin's militarism and ideology, a Schemes investigation found.Those posts helped Schemes identify hundreds of mercenaries, find previously unreported training facilities with the aid of satellite imagery, and discover the location and the nature of some of the Cubans' military activities in Russia and on Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory.They also raise questions about how hard Cuba's pro-Russian government is ""working to neutralize and dismantle a human trafficking network,"" as its Foreign Ministry claimed in September 2023, when evidence of Cubans fighting in the war was beginning to emerge. Dead In The Battle For BakhmutImportant indications of the scale of Cubans' involvement in the war came just days after the Cuban Foreign Ministry's statement, when a document hack unearthed nearly 200 Cubans serving in the Russian military, initially posted to the Tula region south of Moscow.That trove was first discovered by the Ukraine-focused investigative group InformNapalm, with the documents proving the Cubans' service coming from the e-mail account of a Russian major hacked by Cyber Resistance, a Ukrainian hacker group.Since then, RFE journalists have found new evidence of hundreds of other apparent Cuban mercenaries on the Russian social network VKontakte.In many cases, their accounts were created in 2024 -- seemingly the year they arrived in Russia for pre-deployment training. The Schemes investigation tied many of the Cuban mercenaries with an online presence to the 106th Airborne Division. In one example, a photo posted in July 2023 by a man named Aliesky Anache included the geotag Promyshlenny Proyezd, an area of the city of Tula known to host the 106th Airborne Division and its 51st Parachute Regiment.Journalists were subsequently able to geolocate the blue-walled military building where that photo was taken. Satellite imagery of the region suggests there is no other military unit stationed anywhere in the surrounding area.Units of the 106th Airborne Division participated in the battle for Bakhmut. Known grimly as ""the meat grinder,"" the monthslong battle concluded with the Russian occupation of the city in May 2023 and was the one of the bloodiest chapters of the war to date.And at least one Cuban, a 41-year-old fighter with the call sign Chiki, appears to have died there before being buried in Moscow, according to a post on VKontakte found by RFE journalists. Another Cuban with the same call sign became a minor celebrity in Russia after appearing on the military TV channel Zvezda.In a segment of a Zvezda program on August 2, 2024, the fighter, whose real name is Rafael, was seen scrawling ""Hasta la vista, baby"" (""Goodbye, baby"" in Spanish) on military projectiles and informed the interviewer that he had ""fallen in love with buckwheat,"" a Russian staple, during his military service.Rafael's VKontakte profile features photos of him wearing patches associated with Russia's Wagner Group.From August on, Rafael posted several images from combat positions in Ukraine's Kherson region. But many of his social media posts before then featured photos with other Cubans during training exercises and outings to bars in Tula. The bar photos and the fighters that featured in them helped RFE journalists geolocate a second military facility used by the Cubans of the 106th. This previously unpublicized facility in the Tula region is the paratrooper training ground, unofficially called Krym (Crimea) in VKontakte geotags.Rush For Rubles, Assist For RussiaGrueling poverty in Cuba helps explain the appeal of Russian military service to Cubans. Historically friendly ties with Moscow dating back to Soviet times mean that citizens of the island nation can enter the country as tourists without a visa.A typical monthly salary for a foreigner enlisting in the Russian army on a yearlong contract is the equivalent of $2,000.That was seemingly enough for Odin Rivas, who featured in one of Rafael's posts from Tula, to swap running a small business in Cuba for active military duty. Rivas has been posting frequently from military positions, promoting Russian and Soviet propaganda symbols.Back in 2022, he was being celebrated as a hero in the Cuban press after he volunteered as a firefighter to help extinguish a giant fire at the Matanzas oil terminal.Matanzas is at the heart of Moscow's patronly ties to Cuba, since it receives large oil deliveries from Russian tankers. Using the ship-tracking service Marine Traffic and satellite images from Planet Labs, RFE journalists found satellite images showing that Russian oil tankers had docked in Cuban ports in 2022, 2023, and 2024.According to data obtained by Schemes from the KSE Institute and Kpler, in 2024, tankers transported more than 1.8 million barrels of Russian oil products to Cuba. From the beginning of 2025, they carried more than 700,000 barrels to the Caribbean island.One of those deliveries came at a vital time as Cuba witnessed its worst protests in several years in March 2024 amid energy and food shortages.Havana has never formally endorsed Russia's invasion.But on March 1, a day when Russia targeted civilian infrastructure and killed hundreds of civilians in cities across Ukraine, its Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Pedro Luis Pedroso Cuesta, criticized the West for ""assuming that Russia would remain defenseless in the face of direct threats to its national security.""And in May 2024, Russian state media reported Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel had wished Russian President Vladimir Putin success in ""the special military operation,"" as the Kremlin calls the war, during talks in Moscow that coincided with Russia's May 9 military parade commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.In comments to Schemes, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said Cuba ""has clearly chosen Russia's side in the full-scale war because of its anti-American stance.""In addition to extensive open-source research, Schemes journalists obtained copies of Russian military documents from Ukrainian military sources concerning other Cubans who are serving in Russian military units. One of the documents was a questionnaire belonging to Julio Pelaez, a 38-year-old man who last September appealed in Russian on VKontakte for help getting a plane ticket to Moscow in order to report to ""any recruitment center.""In the questionnaire, Pelaez, who said he had never been abroad before, appeared to lean into a Kremlin propaganda trope concerning Ukraine when stating his motivation to join the war. ""I consider it the duty of every free person who hates Nazis,"" Pelaez wrote.By the end of October, according to his profile page, Pelaez was in Russia, and had posted a photo of his military gear complete with the pro-war ""Z"" symbol, a patch featuring the Cuban flag, and a document resembling a Russian passport","Russia Turns To Cuban Recruits As It Struggles With Conscription, RFE/RL Reveals","Valeriya Yegoshyna, Olya Ivleva, Kyrylo Ovsyaniy, Kira Tolstyakova, Schemes",RFE/RL,2025-02-19T11:14:50,2025-02-19T11:14:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czep44jn9jyo,"The UK military is ""so run down"" it could not lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, the former head of the Army has said. Lord Dannatt told the BBC that up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed for such a mission and ""we just haven't got that number available"". It comes after Sir Keir Starmer said the UK would ""play its part"" in guaranteeing Ukraine's security after the prime minister was asked this week if he was open to sending British troops as peacekeepers. A former Nato chief told the BBC that Britain and France should lead a force of up to 100,000 troops as part of a long-term peacekeeping effort should Russia's war with Ukraine end. US President Donald Trump earlier this week announced he had had a lengthy conversation with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations to stop the ""ridiculous war"" in Ukraine would begin ""immediately"". Trump then ""informed"" Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, of his plan. Lord Dannatt - who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2009 - agreed that a force to keep the peace would require about 100,000 troops. However he said the UK would have to supply ""quite a proportion of that and we really couldn't do it"". ""Our military is so run down at the present moment, numerically and as far as capability and equipment is concerned, it would potentially be quite embarrassing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster. ""I mean, if we were to deploy 10,000 troops, each rotation for six months, that would effectively tie up 30,000 or 40,000 troops and we just haven't got that number available. ""So there are some big issues here that today's politicians won't really have considered."" It comes as Britain's foreign and defence secretaries called on the UK and Europe to ""do more"" to ""share the burden"" of regional security in a joint article for the Daily Telegraph on Saturday. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said he was ""very encouraged"" by his talks on Ukraine with US Vice-President JD Vance on Friday, on the first day of the Munich Security Conference. ""We share the view that there has to be an enduring peace,"" Lammy told Reuters news agency following the meeting. ""There was an agreement that Zelensky and the Ukrainians have to be part of that negotiated deal."" The talks came after Vance gave a speech at the conference, in which he was expected to address possible talks to end the war but instead attacked European democracies. In the address, he said the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but ""from within"". He added that Europe must ""step up in a big way to provide for its own defence"" and said he hoped a ""reasonable settlement"" could be reached for the war. Lammy and his defence colleague John Healey said that Putin had for two decades sought ""to recreate the Russian empire and suffocate the countries around its borders"". ""Too often in the past, the West has let him,"" they said in the Telegraph. ""We did too little in 2008 when he invaded Georgia, and in 2014 when he first went into Ukraine."" Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who was Nato secretary-general from 2009 to 2014, said ""a number of European countries need to step up to the plate"" for any peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, adding that the UK and France should lead that coalition by putting boots on the ground. ""I would let military experts determine [the number] but my guess would be between 50,000 and 100,000 troops,"" he told BBC Newsnight. As of October 2024, there were 74,612 members of the UK's regular Army forces (excluding Gurkhas and volunteers), according to the latestMinistry of Defence (MoD) figures. The Army has targets on how many new recruits below the rank of officer it should take on every year, set out by the MoD. These targets have been missed in almost every single financial year since 2010-11, according to a written answer to Parliament last January. Lord Dannatt said the Labour government would need to ""look at their priorities"", adding: ""Yes, health, education, roads, infrastructure are important, but actually defence and the security of this nation are more important."" The crossbench peer said he believes the UK government needs to go further than its commitment of increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP - a pledge that they have yet to put a timeline on when it will be delivered. Zelensky has previously asked for the UK and other European allies including France to send troops to Ukraine for a peacekeeping operation after the war. Sir Keir last month signed a ""landmark"" 100-year pact with Ukraine, building on the Â£12.8bn the UK has already sent to the country, with further commitments of Â£3bn every year for ""as long as it takes"". The UK will also continue to train Ukrainian troops, 50,000 of whom have been trained on British soil so far. In response to Lord Dannatt's comments, an MoD spokesperson said Britain's armed forces were ""respected worldwide for their professionalism and excellence"". ""Right now, the Ukrainians are still fighting with huge courage. Our government is stepping up support for Ukraine's war fighters to put them in the best possible position for any talks. The spokesperson cited a Â£150m ""firepower package"" announced this week ""providing more drones, tanks and air defence systems"". Some of the men who were there look back nearly 80 years to the largest single airborne operation. The deal sets up an investment fund to search for minerals, and set outs how revenues would be split. The White House has been pushing for the agreement as a prerequisite for further military assistance. A minister says nearly all key details have been finalised for a deal giving the US access to the country's minerals.

The stage features Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad flags, as well as propaganda posters, including a picture of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar looking at the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem with the caption in English, Hebrew and Arabic, saying “No migration except to Jerusalem,” a dig at US President Donald Trump’s call to resettle Gazans. Another poster has aerial images of the communities and bases that Hamas invaded on October 7, 2023, with the caption, “We crossed over swiftly.” In the coming hours, hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen, Sasha Troufanov and Iair Horn are expected to be released from captivity. Dekel-Chen and Horn are being held by Hamas, while Troufanov is being held by Islamic Jihad. Ù

The C-17 US military aircraft will carry 67 persons from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, three Uttar Pradesh natives, two each from Rajasthan, Goa, and Maharashtra, and one each native of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Saturday's flight is expected to arrive at the Amristar airport around 10 pm. The deportations will continue every other week till all the illegal immigrants are not sent back to their respective homeland, a news agency PTI report said. Last week, 104 illegal Indian migrants were deported from the US. They were sent in a US military C-17 transport aircraft to Amritsar. The deportations also come in the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the US, where he met Trump to discuss several key bilateral issues, including immigration. Addressing a joint press conference, PM Modi affirmed that New Delhi is ready to take back its citizens living illegally in America. He said most of those staying in the US illegally come from ordinary families, often misguided by human traffickers. ""They are shown big dreams and most of them are such who are misled and brought here. So, we should attack this entire system of human trafficking. Together, it should be the effort of the US and India to destroy such an ecosystem from its roots so that human trafficking ends... Our bigger fight is against that entire ecosystem, and we are confident that President Trump will fully cooperate with India in finishing this ecosystem,"" the prime minister said at the presser. However, it is notable that the treatment given to the deported Indians did not sit well, sparking a massive controversy among people and the political circuit alike. Opposition leaders came down heavily on the Centre, asking it to take a stand against the unfair treatment given to the deportees. The handcuffing and shackling of deportees has been justified by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as a standard security protocol used on deportation flights to prevent escape attempts or disruptions. However, many have argued that such a practice is excessive and inhuman, especially for people who have committed no crimes beyond immigration violations. External affairs minister S Jaishankar addressed the matter in the Parliament and asserted that India is engaging with US officials to ensure that the deportees are given dignified treatment. He further emphasised that while immigration laws must be upheld, humane treatment should be not a compromise. The Trump administration has brought down a wreck in the lives of thousands of Indians, placing immense pressure on the central government to manage the reintegration efforts. As the immigration laws in the US are being tightened, India will also have to find ways to curb illegal migration with the help of stronger border management and diplomatic negotiations.",Second US flight with Indian migrants to arrive in Punjab's Amritsar today,HT News Desk,Hindustan Times,2025-02-15T09:09:53,2025-02-15T14:10:33,gemini-2.0-flash

The 10th formal hearing will be held at 2 p.m. Thursday, with Han, Hong Jang-won, former first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service, and Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the National Police Agency, chosen for witness examinations. The announcement comes a day after the court said the trial's ninth hearing will take place Tuesday. The court had previously rejected a request from Yoon's lawyers to call Han as a witness, citing the lack of necessity. But the lawyers requested Han's presence again, saying he best understood the reasons behind the Dec. 3 martial law imposition. Hong had testified at the court earlier this month, but Yoon's lawyers requested he appear again, raising doubt over his testimony. Cho, who is suffering from blood cancer, had also previously been selected as a witness but failed to appear twice, citing health reasons. If he fails to appear again, the court could consider forcefully bringing him in. He is considered to be a key witness in the trial due to his alleged involvement in martial law operations. The court is expected to decide whether to schedule more hearings based on the trial's proceedings. If it does not select additional witnesses, the court could conclude oral arguments in the last week of February, and a final decision on whether to uphold Yoon's impeachment or reinstate him is likely to be reached in early or mid-March. Meanwhile, Thursday's impeachment hearing will coincide with the first preparatory hearing of Yoon's criminal trial on charges related to his martial law imposition. The criminal hearing is scheduled to take place in the morning. Yoon's legal team requested the Constitutional Court to change the date for the 10th formal hearing to a different date.

Cho made the remarks as he arrived at Munich International Airport to attend an annual international security forum in Munich, where he is set to have his first in-person meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday (local time). The planned talks come as President Donald Trump announced a plan to impose 25-percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, starting March 12, and is pushing to roll out ""reciprocal"" tariffs on U.S. imports to match what other countries impose on American goods. Trump has also been weighing tariffs on cars, chips and pharmaceuticals. ""I have this thought that (I) will have discussions on ways for strategic cooperation in the shipbuilding industry, atomic energy and cutting-edge technology sectors, including semiconductor and artificial intelligence; explain our thoughts and position on 25-percent tariffs on steel and aluminum and the issue of reciprocal tariffs; and express our will to resolve it through dialogue and explore a solution,"" he told reporters. ""In terms of specifics, there might not be much time to go as far as to touch on solutions, but I will convey our position and thought in what could be a spadework (in pursuit of a solution),"" he added. Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul arrives at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, on Feb. 14, 2025 to depart for Germany, where he is set to attend the Munich Security Conference. (Yonhap) Cho underscored the need to take into account Trump's perceived transactional approach on foreign policy issues as Seoul seeks to enhance its national interests in diplomacy with the Trump administration. ""After all, to find a win-win solution, we need to appeal to the U.S. by underscoring how important South Korea's role is for the alliance and how it can contribute to the effort to achieve (Trump's) vision to make America great again,"" he said. The minister noted that during his call with the secretary on Jan. 23, he confirmed the shared consensus on the ""firm"" alliance, cooperation on North Korean issues and the importance of trilateral cooperation among South Korea, the U.S. and Japan.

Hezbollah supporters attacked the convoy of Lázaro as it tried to make its way to Rafik Hariri International Airport. Lebanese forces fired tear gas to break up a protest organized by Hezbollah supporters near Beirut airport on Saturday, Reuters reported, citing Lebanese Security sources. Protestors claimed their goal was to secure the return of citizens stranded in Iran and block external influences on the Lebanese government, Hezbollah-owned Al Manar reported. UNIFIL demanded a full and immediate investigation by Lebanese authorities and for all perpetrators to be brought to justice, it added in a statement. At least one UNIFIL officer was injured in the incident after Hezbollah operatives attacked the vehicle marked with the UN logo, beating the people inside. The Lebanese LBCI network reported that four UNIFIL personnel were attacked. Three fled to the airport, and the fourth was taken to a military hospital. The attackers used iron rods, set fire to at least one vehicle, and shouted ""Shiite, Shiite"" during the attack, Lebanese media reported. Social media footage showed protestors waving Hezbollah flags, blocking the road and setting fires on it. The Lebanese Army warned Lebanese citizens from participating in the riots, saying it created dangerous internal tension during a critical period for the country. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam condemned the attack and expressed support for UNIFIL. Ø¥Ø·Ù

https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-pledges-immediate-response-to-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs/,"The line from Brussels appears to have hardened since its response to Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs earlier this week. The EU has pledged to respond “firmly and immediately” to Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs on all US imports, in a sign that Brussels’ negotiating stance with the new US administration may be hardening. In a statement published on Friday morning, the EU's executive denounced Trump’s decision to match the tariff rate other countries charge on US goods as “a step in the wrong direction” and reiterated its commitment to an “open and predictable global trading system”. “The EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade, including when tariffs are used to challenge legal and non-discriminatory policies,” the Commission said. The language noticeably differs from Brussels’ response to Trump’s announcement of 25% duties on steel and aluminium earlier this week, when it vowed a “firm and proportionate” response. The word “proportionate” was entirely absent from Friday’s statement. But the word was used by European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis – who told Bloomberg TV on Friday morning that Brussels’ is committed to a “firm and proportionate” response. “We do not see the basis for these tariffs, neither economically nor legally,” he said, adding that the Berlaymont is “in engagement” with US officials to “find a constructive way forward”. The Commission's comments follow Trump’s announcement on Thursday night that Washington will impose “reciprocal” levies to address cases of “unfair” economic protectionism by other nations. The duties could enter into force as early as April 2, according to the White House. The EU’s average tariff rate is higher than the US's in many critical export-dependent sectors, including cars, chemicals and food. However, the bloc’s overall average tariff rate is slightly below the US's average of 3.95%, according to economists at ING. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump repeatedly denounced the EU’s trade policy vis-à-vis the US. ""We all love Europe, love the countries in Europe, but the European Union has been absolutely brutal on trade,"" he said. The EU ran a surplus in goods of €150 billion and a deficit in services of roughly €100 billion with the US in 2023, according to the EU. The 25% duties on steel and aluminium are set to enter into force on 12 March. However, Trump has repeatedly said that countries could avoid the duties by lowering trade barriers or shifting production to the US. Trump has also introduced an additional 10% levy on all imports from China and threatened to impose 25% duties on Mexico and Canada since his return to the White House last month.

He was there “for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue in a hospital setting treatment for bronchitis that is still ongoing,” the Vatican said. They later confirmed he was in the facility, and that he had canceled his meetings for the next three days. Francis has made a number of visits to the hospital in recent years, and received abdominal surgery in 2023. He has been struggling with bronchitis in recent weeks and has asked aides to read speeches and addresses. But he held audiences at the Vatican on Friday morning before his hospitalization, including with the prime minister of Slovakia and with Mark Thompson, the Chief Executive of CNN. Christopher Lamb, CNN’s Vatican Correspondent, who saw Francis at the beginning of that meeting, said the pope was mentally alert but struggling to speak for extended periods due to breathing difficulties. The latest diagnosis of bronchitis will cause particular worries for the Roman Catholic Church, because Francis has suffered from lung-related issues for much of his life. As a young man, the Argentinian leader suffered from severe pneumonia and had part of one lung removed. Francis became pope in 2013, the first pontiff from South America. More recently he has been seen with a walking stick and sometimes uses a wheelchair. Last month, he suffered a fall and injured his arm. Francis also suffers from diverticulitis, a common condition that can cause the inflammation or infection of the colon. In 2021, he had surgery to remove part of his colon. Despite his medical issues Francis has kept up a busy calendar of events, including a 12-day visit of four countries in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. That trip was one of the longest any pope has embarked on and marked the furthest geographical distance (about 20,000 miles) that Francis has traveled since being chosen as the leader of the Catholic Church. Last week, it was announced that the pope would meet King Charles III in April. Christopher Lamb reported from the Vatican, and Antonia Mortensen reported from Rome.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2025/02/14/2003831865,"The government will continue to support a humanitarian group in the Czech Republic that provides services to Ukrainian refugees, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and the group in Prague on Tuesday said. The MOU paves the way for a new round of cooperation between Taiwan and the Czech group — People in Need — in a joint effort to assist Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic, the ministry said on Wednesday. Through the joint project, the Czech group would provide shelter for young Ukrainians fleeing the ongoing war at home and offer counseling services to refugees in the Czech Republic, ministry said. Photo: Huang Chin-hsuen, Taipei Times With a budget of US$283,252, the project, which is to run until the end of this year, is expected to help 4,825 displaced Ukrainians, the ministry told the Central News Agency, without specifying if the government would be the source of the funding. Taiwan in 2022 donated US$1 million to People in Need to support its programs aiding the education and integration of displaced Ukrainian children in Czech schools, along with other assistance. The US$1 million in funding was part of the US$32 million that the ministry raised from private citizens in Taiwan shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The MOU was signed between Representative to the Czech Republic Ke Liang-ruey (柯良叡) and People in Need executive director Simon Panek. The deal was lauded by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois Wu (吳志中), who took part in the signing ceremony remotely from Taipei, as another “milestone” for Taiwan-Czechia collaborations in their help for Ukraine, the ministry said in a news release. Panek was cited in the release as expressing gratitude for Taiwan’s aid to Ukraine, citing how countless Ukrainian refugees had benefited from Taiwan’s support. The ministry in its release also reaffirmed Taiwan’s commitment to supporting Ukraine as the war continues and to keep working with the Czech Republic to provide humanitarian assistance to Ukrainian refugees. Czech Commissioner for Human Rights Klara Simackova Laurencikova also took part in the signing ceremony in Prague, the release said. Founded in 1992, People in Need has grown to become the largest humanitarian organization in the Czech Republic and one of the most important non-governmental organizations in central and eastern Europe, the ministry said. Taiwan would benefit from more integrated military strategies and deployments if the US and its allies treat the East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea as a “single theater of operations,” a Taiwanese military expert said yesterday. Shen Ming-shih (沈明室), a researcher at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said he made the assessment after two Japanese military experts warned of emerging threats from China based on a drill conducted this month by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Eastern Theater Command.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2025/02/14/2003831873,"An alleged US government plan to encourage Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) to form a joint venture with Intel to boost US chipmaking would place the Taiwanese foundry giant in a more disadvantageous position than proposed tariffs on imported chips, a semiconductor expert said yesterday. If TSMC forms a joint venture with its US rival, it faces the risk of technology outflow, said Liu Pei-chen (å	8a	89ä½©ç	9c	9f), a researcher at the Taiwan Industry Economics Database of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. A report by international financial services firm Baird said that Asia semiconductor supply chain talks suggest that the US government would ask TSMC to send engineers to Intelâ	80	99s US fab, applying the companyâ	80	99s know-how to ensure both the fab and subsequent manufacturing projects are viable. Photo: CNA Although TSMC has built production facilities in Dresden, Germany, and Kumamoto, Japan, through joint ventures, the local businesses it partners with are its customers, Liu said. If a joint venture with Intel is formed, it would inevitably focus on advanced semiconductor technology and once technology leaks occur, that could jeopardize TSMCâ	80	99s leading edge in advanced technology, he said. As US President Donald Trump is committed to prioritizing US interests, if TSMC cooperates with Intel it might be placed at a disadvantage, he added. TSMCâ	80	99s leadership in advanced technology is irreplaceable and gives it strong bargaining power, Liu said, adding that if the US imposes tariffs on imported chips, the increased costs could be passed on to TSMCâ	80	99s customers in the US. Therefore, a joint venture with Intel is the worse choice for TSMC and more unfavorable than Trumpâ	80	99s tariff plans, he said. Intel is facing operational difficulties and is encountering bottlenecks in technological development, while TSMC is in a leading position. If a TSMC-Intel joint venture is formed, it would help Intel overcome difficulties and bolster the development of the US semiconductor manufacturing industry, Liu said. TSMC chairman C.C. Wei (é	ad	8få	93²å®¶) has said the company has no interest in acquiring Intelâ	80	99s chip manufacturing facilities after the US firm spun off its foundry business, he said. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra said that while there is no confirmation and the potential completion of the project could take a long time, the move would make sense, â	80	9cfurther building on Intelâ	80	99s prior CEOâ	80	99s focus on the companyâ	80	99s core competency, manufacturing.â	80	9d Taiwan would benefit from more integrated military strategies and deployments if the US and its allies treat the East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea as a â	80	9csingle theater of operations,â	80	9d a Taiwanese military expert said yesterday.

https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-russia-us-kremlin-us-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-illusory-goal/,"Ukraine will participate in negotiations with Russia and the United States “one way or another,” but peace talks will remain primarily bilateral, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. “We, of course, understand that our main counterpart in this process is Washington,” Peskov said, according to Russian state media. “One way or another, of course, Ukraine will participate in the negotiations. Of course, there will be a bilateral Russian-American track of this dialogue, and a track that, of course, will be connected with Ukraine's involvement.” Peskov’s remarks came after a whirlwind 24 hours in which U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and declared that negotiations between the U.S. and Russia to end the war in Ukraine would commence imminently, notably sidelining Ukrainian participation in his public messaging. At the same time, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called a return to Ukraine’s old borders an “illusory goal.”
Later in the day, Trump declined to directly answer a reporter’s question about Ukraine’s role in the coming talks. “It’s an interesting question,” Trump replied, before suggesting that Ukraine chose to enter into a war with Russia after its invasion. “I think they have to make peace. That was not a good war to go into.” The Trump administration’s decision to downplay Ukraine’s role in negotiations with Russia — and to reopen communication channels with the Russian leader — rattled European leaders and prompted an outpouring of criticism for Trump’s methods.
“Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity are unconditional,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Wednesday night. “Our priority must now be strengthening Ukraine and providing robust security guarantees.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy put on a brave face after his conversation with Trump on Wednesday, saying the two leaders had a “meaningful conversation” about peace. But the Ukrainian leader was more forceful in his language on Thursday, saying he and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk had agreed on a call that “no negotiations with Putin can begin without a united position from Ukraine, Europe and the U.S.” “I also warned world leaders against trusting Putin’s claims of readiness to end the war,” Zelenskyy added.",Kremlin: Ukraine can be part of peace talks — but main players will be US and Russia,Giselle Ruhiyyih Ewing,POLITICO,2025-02-13T19:50:36,2025-02-13T19:50:36,gemini-2.0-flash
