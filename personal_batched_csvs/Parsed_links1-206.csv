https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-iaea-zarif-tehran-c3a8afc699c670300b9521f1e2019ef7,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran confirmed Wednesday that the next round of nuclear talks with the United States this weekend will be held in Rome after earlier confusion over where the negotiations would be held. The announcement by Iranian state television came as Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian formally approved the resignation of one of his vice presidents who served as Tehran’s key negotiator in its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency, also arrived in the Islamic Republic on Wednesday. His talks may include negotiations over just what access the IAEA inspectors can get under any proposed deal. The state TV announcement said Oman will again mediate the talks on Saturday in Rome. Oman’s foreign minister served as an interlocutor between the two sides at talks last weekend in Muscat, the sultanate’s capital. Officials initially on Monday identified Rome as hosting the negotiations, only for Iran to insist early Tuesday they would return to Oman. American officials so far haven’t said publicly where the talks will be held, though Trump did call Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq on Tuesday, while the ruler was on a trip to the Netherlands. The stakes of the negotiations couldn’t be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear program if a deal isn’t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Pezeshkian praises former vice president while acknowledging his resignation The former vice president, Mohammad Javad Zarif, served as a key supporter of Pezeshkian in his election last year but drew criticism from hard-liners within Iran’s Shiite theocracy, who long have alleged Zarif gave away too much in negotiations. In March, Zarif tendered his resignation to Pezeshkian. However, the president did not immediately respond to the letter. Zarif has used resignation announcements in the past in his political career as leverage, including in a dispute last year over the composition of Pezeshkian’s Cabinet. The president had rejected that resignation. But on late Tuesday, a statement from the presidency said Pezeshkian wrote Zarif a letter praising him but accepting his resignation. “Pezeshkian emphasized that due to certain issues, his administration can no longer benefit from Zarif’s valuable knowledge and expertise,” a statement from the presidency said. The president in a decree appointed Mohsen Ismaili, 59, to be his new vice president for strategic affairs. In Iran’s political system, the president has multiple vice presidents. Ismaili is known as a political moderate and a legal expert. Grossi visit comes as Iran has restricted IAEA access Grossi arrived in Tehran for meetings with Pezeshkian and others. He met Wednesday night with Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on the social platform X after the meeting: “Cooperation with (the IAEA) is indispensable to provide credible assurances about the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme at a time when diplomacy is urgently needed.” Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency described Araghchi as briefing Grossi on the first round of talks with the U.S., while also urging the IAEA to “adopt a clear and transparent stance regarding threats against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities.” Both Israel and the U.S. have threatened to attack Iran’s nuclear sites if a deal can’t be reached to limit Tehran’s program. “As variety of spoilers are gathered to derail current negotiations, we need a Director General of Peace,” Araghchi wrote on X. “Our predisposition is to trust Grossi in mission to keep the Agency away from politics and politicization, and to retain focus on its technical mandate.” Since the nuclear deal’s collapse in 2018 with Trump’s unilateral withdraw of the U.S. from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its program, and enriches uranium to up to 60% purity — near weapons-grade levels of 90%. Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency’s most experienced inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that they could pursue atomic weapons, something the West and the IAEA have been worried about for years since Tehran abandoned an organized weapons program in 2003. Any possible deal between Iran and the U.S. likely would need to rely on the IAEA’s expertise to ensure Tehran’s compliance. And despite tensions between Iran and the agency, its access has not been entirely revoked. Iran’s foreign minister questions contradictory responses from US envoy Meanwhile, Araghchi on Wednesday warned the U.S. about taking contradictory stances in the talks. That likely refers to comments from U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who this week initially suggested a deal could see Iran go back to 3.67% uranium enrichment — like in the 2015 deal reached by the Obama administration. Witkoff then followed up with saying “a deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.” “Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,” he wrote on X. “It is imperative for the world that we create a tough, fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.” Araghchi warned America about taking any “contradictory and opposing stances” in the talks. “What is certain is that Iran’s enrichment (program) is a real, accepted matter,” he said. “We are prepared to build trust and address any potential concerns, but the core issue of enrichment itself is not negotiable.” ___ Karimi reported from Tehran, Iran.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7pqzk47zo,"Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales. The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people. The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women. The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words ""woman"" and ""sex"" are defined in the legislation. He told the court: ""The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. ""But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not."" He added that the legislation gives transgender people ""protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender"". Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears. The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including ""sex"" and ""gender reassignment"". Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by ""sex"" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, ""certificated"" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex ""for all purposes"". For Women Scotland argued for a ""common sense"" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an ""immutable biological state"". Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: ""Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex. ""Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling."" First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement. Heposted on social media: ""The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster. ""We will now engage on the implications of the ruling."" Swinney added: ""Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions."" A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted ""in good faith"" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement. A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring ""clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs"". ""Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,"" the spokesman added. Conservative leader Kemi Badenochdescribed the rulingas a ""victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious"". She added: ""It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so."" Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: ""It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK."" But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: ""This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society. ""It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next."" For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups. Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender. Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was ""shocked"" by the court ruling, arguing that it ""reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates"". They added: ""This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services. ""It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody."" The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy overtransgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prisonand an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse whoobjected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room. NHS Fife said it would ""carefully consider"" the court's judgement. The judges ruled that interpreting sex as ""certificated"" rather than ""biological"" would ""cut across the definitions of man and ""woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way"". They said a ""certified"" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian. The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to ""function coherently"". It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions. The judges noted ""similar confusion and impracticability"" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces. The judges added: ""The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct."" Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender. However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs ""if it is proportionate to do so"". Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman. He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex. But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be ""settled"" by this court case. He told the BBC: ""It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them."" Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a ""reassessment"" of rules. The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards. For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law. The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts. Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was ""not limited to biological or birth sex"". The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex. The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers. Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-04-16-2025-884713e2096d5353e3008ec7d9cc01ab,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s defense minister said on Wednesday that troops will remain in so-called security zones in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely, remarks that could further complicate talks with Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage release. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes across Gaza killed another 22 people, according to local health officials, including a girl who was not yet a year old. The girl’s mother, who was wounded, embraced her daughter, still wearing a bloodied blue dress, before she was taken for burial. Israeli forces have taken over more than half of Gaza in a renewed campaign to pressure Hamas militants to release hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire last month. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria after rebels overthrew Syrian President Bashar Assad in December. “Unlike in the past, the (Israeli military) is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. The military “will remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and (Israeli) communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza — as in Lebanon and Syria.” The Palestinians and both neighboring countries view the presence of Israeli troops as military occupation in violation of international law. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports displaced Palestinians have been told to leave shelters in the West Bank; many have nowhere to go. Lebanese president Joseph Aoun said that Israel’s continued presence in some areas in Lebanon was “hindering” the Lebanese army’s full deployment as required by the ceasefire negotiated with Israel. Two Israeli drones strikes on Wednesday in southern Lebanon killed two people, the health ministry said. The U.N. said Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 70 civilians since the ceasefire took effect in November. Hamas has said it will not release dozens of remaining hostages without a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire. “They promised that the hostages come first. In practice, Israel is choosing to seize territory before the hostages,” the main organization representing families of the hostages said in a statement. “There is one solution that is desirable and feasible, and that is the release of all the hostages at once as part of an agreement, even at the cost of ending the war.” Israel says it must maintain control of what it refers to as security zones to prevent a repeat of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack in which thousands of militants stormed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Israel’s offensive has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says women and children make up more than half of the dead. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. Ahlam Seiam’s family had planned to celebrate her first birthday later this month. Then the Israeli strike hit the building where they had pitched a tent on the roof. Her grandfather, Nashat, said the family was awakened by a blast overnight. When he raced to the roof, he found his son, Mohammed, sobbing. “I found her like this,” he said as he held the girl’s body. Associated Press footage showed the mother, wrapped in bandages, cradling her daughter one last time in the hospital bed. Israel says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas. The grandfather said there were no militants in the area of the strike. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The family had fled to Khan Younis from the southern city of Rafah after Israel renewed its offensive last month. “Wherever you go, death will catch up with you. There is no escape,” the grandfather said. Nermin Zughrub, Ahlam’s aunt, scrolled through photos of the girl on her phone. “If the world doesn’t wake up today, when will it?” she said. “Every day, massacres. Every day, children.” Israel’s bombardment and ground operations have left vast areas of the territory uninhabitable and have displaced around 90% of the population of roughly 2 million Palestinians. Many have been displaced multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps with dwindling food as an aid blockade in Gaza imposed by Israel entered its seventh week. The U.N. humanitarian office, or OCHA, said Wednesday that humanitarian workers on the ground are reporting a rise in acute malnutrition across the Gaza Strip. Water has become increasingly scarce, with Palestinians desperately lining up in front of water trucks clutching containers and jerrycans. Omar Shatat, deputy director of Gaza’s Coastal Water Utility, told The Associated Press that each person gets six to seven liters of potable water each day, calling it a “water catastrophe.” ”Water, it’s the simplest thing,” said Nevin Al-Dahloul, a displaced woman from Beit Lahiya. “We’re not asking for luxury, it’s our most basic right.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to annihilate Hamas and return the 59 hostages still in Gaza — 24 of whom are believed to still be alive. On Wednesday, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group released a video of hostage Rom Braslavski. It was the first sign of life of him, though recently released hostages had said they had seen him in captivity. In the video, which was filmed under duress, Braslavski says he was held in terrible conditions and pleads with Netanyahu to stop the war and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Netanyahu also has said that Israel will implement U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal for the resettlement of much of Gaza’s population in other countries through what Netanyahu refers to as “voluntary emigration.” Palestinians and Arab countries have universally rejected Trump’s proposal, which human rights experts say would likely violate international law. Palestinians in Gaza say they don’t want to leave, and fear another mass expulsion like the one that occurred during the war surrounding Israel’s creation in 1948. The Trump administration, which took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire, has expressed full support for Israel’s decision to end the truce and to cut off aid. Trump’s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been trying to broker a new ceasefire, more favorable to Israel, but those efforts appear to have made little progress. Netanyahu leads the most nationalist and religious government in Israel’s history, and his coalition partners have called for the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.

Earlier this month, Trump imposed steep ""reciprocal"" tariffs on South Korea, Japan and several other countries, but later announced a 90-day suspension of the new measures to allow for negotiations.

https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250415-french-pm-bayrou-warns-trump-s-hurricane-has-made-france-vulnerable,"France urgently needs to reduce its budget deficit to confront a “tsunami of destabilisation” that includes a bellicose Russia and a trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister François Bayrou said on Tuesday. The upheaval caused by Trump’s tariffs and his decision to turn against traditional allies has shattered trust around the world, Bayrou said in unusually strident comments, warning France’s growing debt and larger budget deficits compared to European peers made it vulnerable. “The president of the United States has started a hurricane whose consequences will not end any time soon,” Bayrou said in a news conference meant to drum up support ahead of talks about the 2026 budget that pose a risk for his minority government. “As if war weren’t enough, a tsunami of destabilisation came to shake up the planet,” Bayrou said, saying the world had witnessed “a reversal of alliances that no one could have imagined” as he pointed to Trump’s treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office in February. Read moreTrump, Vance and Zelensky at the White House President Emmanuel Macron, treading a careful path of international diplomacy, has been less outspoken about Trump than his prime minister, who would traditionally be more focused on the domestic audience. Budget in the balanceBayrou’s predecessor Michel Barnier was toppled in December after he tried to pass a 2025 budget that would have cut spending faster to reduce a budget deficit that rose to 5.8 percent in 2024. Speaking on a podium where a sign read “the truth allows us to act”, Bayrou gave little concrete details on how he intended to cut government spending he said was too high. He ruled out increasing France’s overall tax take, among the highest in the world. He only said he wanted to wrap up consultations with lawmakers and stakeholders on the 2026 budget ahead of the usual September deadline and bring it forward to France’s national holiday on July 14. The government aims to cut the deficit this year to 5.4 percent of economic output as a first step towards bringing the shortfall back in line with a European Union ceiling of 3 percent by 2029. Bayrou, who relies on a minority government inherited from Macron’s failed gambit to call an early election in June last year, is especially dependent on the goodwill of Socialist lawmakers. The Socialist party, which is in the midst of a party leadership contest, has warned it could decide to pull the plug on Bayrou if the wealthiest in society were not part of efforts to reduce the deficit.

The ministry issued the statement as the SCL came into force Tuesday. The DOE's inclusion of South Korea in the list's lowest category has emerged as a hot button issue in bilateral relations. ""We have been actively engaging in negotiations, including working-level consultations at the director-general levels with the U.S. Department of Energy, together with relevant ministries,"" the ministry said, recalling that the two sides have agreed to work out the issue ""promptly through due procedures.""  ""However, as this matter is proceeding in accordance with the U.S. internal procedures, we expect that more time will be needed,"" it said. The DOE confirmed last month that the preceding Biden administration added South Korea to the SCL in early January -- a list that includes North Korea, China and Russia. The designation has stoked concern it could affect science and technology cooperation between the allies. The listed countries are subject to stricter scrutiny when access is requested to DOE research institutions or other facilities for technology cooperation or other purposes. The ministry cited the DOE reaffirming that the designation ""will not affect bilateral cooperation in ongoing or future research and development."" A foreign ministry official said the government and relevant research institutions are monitoring the situation to see whether any research projects or related exchanges have been affected. ""So far, we have not identified any cases that have been impacted,"" the official said. A diplomatic source said that other U.S. allies had been included on the list in the past before later being removed. South Korea was designated on the list in 1981 and was taken off in July 1994, following seven months of negotiations. Multiple sources in Washington said Seoul has not been informed of any DOE decision to reverse the listing before the designation took effect this week, signaling South Korea is now included in the SCL. The DOE did not respond to a request for comment. elly@yna.co.kr(END)",(LEAD) S.

https://www.riotimesonline.com/venezuela-keeps-oil-output-above-one-million-barrels-in-march-opec-reports/,"Venezuela kept its crude oil production above one million barrels per day in March, according to the latest OPEC report. The country produced 1,048,000 barrels per day, up by 23,000 from February. This figure comes from direct sources, including Venezuela’s state oil company. Secondary sources, such as independent industry analysts, reported a lower figure of 911,000 barrels per day for March. Both numbers show a clear increase compared to the same period last year. The average production for the first quarter of 2025 reached 1,034,667 barrels per day, a 19.75% rise over the previous year. The price of Venezuela’s main crude blend, Merey, dropped to $61.10 per barrel in March from $64.96 in February. This price remains below global benchmarks, reflecting the heavier quality of Venezuelan crude and the challenges in marketing it. Oil exports remain Venezuela’s main source of foreign currency. Since 2017, production has dropped sharply. Venezuelan officials blame U.S. sanctions for this decline. These sanctions have limited Venezuela’s access to international markets and technology. The country’s oil sector saw a partial recovery after the U.S. relaxed some sanctions in late 2022. This allowed companies like Chevron to resume operations and export oil. Chevron’s involvement has been significant, accounting for about a quarter of Venezuela’s total oil production. However, the U.S. government recently replaced Chevron’s license with a more restrictive one. This change requires Chevronto wind down its operations by late May. Other international companies, such as Eni and Repsol, also face new restrictions. These firms together contribute around 300,000 barrels per day to Venezuela’s output. Analysts warn that without these foreign partners, Venezuela’s production could fall below 720,000 barrels per day. The government is seeking new deals with countries like China and Turkey. Officials have announced a plan to boost domestic investment and technology. However, the sector faces technical and financial challenges. Venezuela’s oil industry stands at a crossroads. The country’s ability to maintain or grow output depends on new investment and access to markets. The next months will show if Venezuela can keep its oil sector afloat or face another decline. All figures and claims in this article come from official reports and industry data.","Venezuela Keeps Oil Output Above One Million Barrels in March, OPEC Reports",Juan Martinez,The Rio Times,2025-04-15T05:48:33,2025-04-15T05:53:24,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgy7vwxlxo,"Hamas is said to have rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza which called for the armed group to give up its weapons. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks said the plan gave no commitment to end the war or for an Israeli troop pull-out - key Hamas demands - in exchange for releasing half of the living hostages which it holds. It comes as Israel continues its military offensive in Gaza. A security guard was killed and nine other people were injured in an air strike on a field hospital in Khan Younis, the hospital said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it struck the head of a Hamas cell. A UN agency meanwhile warned that ""the humanitarian situation in Gaza is now likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities"". It is six weeks since Israel allowed any supplies to enter through crossings into the Palestinian territory - by far the longest such stoppage to date. UN agencies strongly refute Israel's claim that there is enough food in Gaza to last for a long time and suggest the blockade could breach international humanitarian law. Israel's prime minister said the block on supplies was aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages and to extend the ceasefire which expired on 1 March. At the same time, the UN's humanitarian affairs office stated: ""Partners on the ground report a surge in attacks causing mass civilian casualties and the destruction of some of the remaining infrastructure that's needed to keep people alive."" Israel is said to have submitted its latest ceasefire proposal to regional mediators late last week, just days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met US President Donald Trump in Washington. A Hamas delegation headed by chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya then met Egyptian intelligence officials in Cairo. The senior Palestinian official told the BBC: ""The Israeli proposal relayed to the movement through Egypt explicitly called for the disarmament of Hamas without any Israeli commitment to end the war or withdraw from Gaza. Hamas therefore rejected the offer in its entirety."" It is understood to be the first time that Israel has added Hamas disarmament as a condition for advancing a ceasefire - a red line for the group. The Palestinian official accused Israel of stalling for time, seeking only to retrieve the hostages while prolonging the war. It is believed that 59 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 24 are alive. On Tuesday afternoon, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing said it had ""lost contact"" with a group of fighters holding Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander following what he described as ""a direct strike on their location"". Abu Ubaida produced no evidence to support the claim and gave no indication of when contact had been lost. Israel has said it avoids hitting locations where it believes hostages are being held. Hamas released a video of the 21-year-old soldier on Saturday, in which he appeared to be speaking under duress as he criticised the Israeli government. Recently released hostages related how many were held with them in dire conditions underground. Some are in poor health with untreated injuries. Hamas has said it is ready to return all of those held captive, in exchange for a complete end to hostilities and full Israeli pull-out from Gaza. It previously offered five hostages in exchange for a truce extension but claims to have shown flexibility on the number of hostages to be released. The BBC understands that Egypt has put forward a modified proposal to Hamas which it is now considering. Israeli media had not been anticipating an imminent ceasefire breakthrough. The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth quoted an unnamed Israeli senior security official as saying: ""We assess that there will be a deal within two-three weeks, but right now there are still gaps and the distance is great."" ""We want to get them to release 19 living hostages. Israel and the United States are co-ordinated, and the military pressure is having an impact,"" the official went on. ""They have a shortage of gas, and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents' return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. Pressure from the residents has begun. That's rattled them."" Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza on 18 March and then restarted ground operations, saying it was targeting Hamas. The prime minister said future ceasefire talks would be held ""under fire"". Since Israel restarted its offensive in Gaza, at least 1,630 people have been killed - bringing the total killed in 18 months of war to 51,000, according to the latest figures from the Hamas-run health ministry. Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the unprecedented Hamas-led 7 October attacks which triggered the war, Israel says. On Tuesday morning, Israeli warplanes struck by the gate of the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in al-Mawasi, a crowded tented area for displaced people on the coast near Khan Younis in southern Gaza, hospital spokesman Saber Abu Arar told the BBC. The man killed worked at the site, he said, and those injured were both hospital staff and patients. Three ambulances and some tents used as a reception area were damaged. Graphic footage released by the field hospital on Facebook showed a man covered in blood being rushed away with attempts made to resuscitate him. The IDF said in a statement that it ""struck the head of a Hamas terrorist cell and a combat zone commander"" outside the hospital, without giving any evidence. It also said a ""precise munition"" was used to mitigate harm in the area. The attack comes after the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, said he was ""deeply alarmed"" at Sunday's strike on al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, his spokesman said. Israel said it targeted a building at the site which Hamas was using as ""a command-and-control centre"" - something the group denied. Doctors scrambled to evacuate the hospital, saying they were given just a 20-minute warning by the IDF. A 12-year-old boy being treated for head injuries is said to have died because his care was disrupted. The hospital - which had been the best functioning in northern Gaza - is now out of service and cannot admit new patients. ""Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,"" the spokesman for Guterres said. He added that the attack dealt ""a severe blow to an already devastated healthcare system in the strip"", adding that with aid blocked, there was strong concern that medical supplies were now running low as well as stocks of food and water. The UN secretary general pointed out that under international humanitarian law, an occupying power had obligations to ensure relief for the civilian population. Recent Israeli military evacuation orders have led to wide-scale displacement of Gaza's 2.1 million population. The UN says about 70% of the strip is currently under displacement orders or in ""no-go"" zones,"" where the Israeli authorities require humanitarian teams to coordinate their movements. In Israel, polls suggest that a majority of Israelis back a Gaza ceasefire deal and - when it comes to their countries' stated war goals - prioritise bringing home the hostages over dismantling Hamas' governing and military capabilities. However, Netanyahu is backed by hard-line religious ultranationalist parties who have threatened to collapse the government if he ends the war. Israel signed onto a ceasefire deal in January, leading to the release of 33 hostages - 25 of them alive - in exchange for some 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in the first six-week stage. It then largely refused to begin talks on the planned second stage which was supposed to lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a complete end to fighting. In the past week, Israeli military reservists and veterans have signed several open letters condemning the ongoing war and questioning its priorities. There has also been criticism of the IDF's chief of staff and air force commander for sacking air force reservists who signed an original statement. This has coincided with rising frustration among reservists and their families over the cost of ongoing reserve duty along with the government's failure to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews despite the IDF facing shortages of combat soldiers.","Hamas rejects Israeli ceasefire disarmament proposal, Palestinian official says","Yolande Knell, Rushdi Abualouf",BBC News,2025-04-15T14:05:13,2025-04-15T14:05:13,gemini-2.0-flash

We are still trying to reach them,” said Obeida. “Be prepared, soon your children will return in black coffins,” Hamas said in a propaganda video published on Tuesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Hamas reportedly rejected the Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza, the BBC reported. A Palestinian official told the British news agency that the proposal did not mention any end to the war nor Israeli troops leaving Gaza, which were Hamas’s key demands for a ceasefire in exchange for half of the remaining living hostages. Hamas released a video of Alexander right before the Passover holiday began in Israel on Saturday. The terror group published the video as part of its ongoing efforts to carry out psychological terror. Earlier, a teaser of the video was released by the group with the captions “Soon” and “Time is running out.” In the video, Alexander blames the Israeli government and the American administration for “deserting” him in Gaza, saying, “I am collapsing physically and mentally.” “Tell me why.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250415009500315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, April 15 (Yonhap) -- Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok on Tuesday said the cost for stationing the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) is not currently among the agenda issues being reviewed for tariff talks with the United States. ""Talks on defense payments are not being reviewed at the moment,"" Choi told a parliamentary interpellation session, when asked whether discussions are under way to adjust South Korea's share of the cost for the upkeep of the 28,500-strong USFK. When asked whether the issue could be included in the Trump administration's proposed ""package deal"" on tariffs and security issues, Choi said while he is aware of public interest in the issue, it is not among the agenda items the South Korean government is currently preparing to handle. The finance minister, meanwhile, said a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Alaska could serve as a potential bargaining chip in the bilateral trade talks. U.S. President Donald Trump recently highlighted the interest of South Korea and other countries in partnering with the U.S. to build a pipeline from the North Slope, a region with massive proven reserves of natural gas, to southern Alaska, where the gas would be liquefied for shipments, primarily to Asia. Choi, however, said discussions with U.S. officials on how negotiations should proceed in the areas of LNG, shipbuilding and trade balance should come first at the current stage. ""Only national interest will be the standard for a decision,"" Choi said, when asked about the economic feasibility of the project, adding such concerns will be sufficiently reviewed. Following his first phone call with South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo, Trump said they discussed a range of issues, including South Korea's defense payments, trade surplus with the U.S., the purchase of U.S. LNG and bilateral shipbuilding cooperation.

https://apnews.com/article/singapore-election-30486264a84bada87ab9fc12410b7da1,"Singapore’s parliament was dissolved Tuesday, paving the way for general elections in which the city-state’s long-ruling People’s Action Party will seek to strengthen its dominance under Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. The election will be held on May 3, the Elections Department said later in the afternoon. Victory is virtually assured for the PAP, which has led Singapore since its independence in 1965. “We are witnessing profound changes in the world. It is becoming more uncertain, unsettled and even unstable,” Wong wrote on Facebook. “The global conditions that enabled Singapore’s success over the past decades may no longer hold. That is why I have called this General Election,” adding that Singaporeans should choose ”the team to lead our nation.” Wong, who was sworn in as Singapore’s fourth leader in May last year, wants to clinch a stronger win after the PAP suffered a setback in 2020 polls over voters’ rising discontent with the government. He succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, who stepped down after two decades at the helm. Lee’s departure marked the end of a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first leader who built the former colonial trading outpost into one of the world’s richest nations during 31 years in office. In the 2020 polls held during the COVID-19 pandemic, the PAP maintained its supermajority with 83 out of 93 seats. But it ceded more seats to the opposition, which increased its parliamentary representation from six to 10, the highest ever. The PAP’s share of popular support also slipped to a near-record low of 61%. As Wong heads into his first general election as PAP chief, he has sought to reach out to disgruntled younger voters. He launched a “Forward Singapore” plan that aims to give Singaporeans a say in how to develop a more balanced, vibrant and inclusive agenda for the next generation. The PAP will field more than 30 new candidates to refresh the party. Wong has warned that “who you have in the cockpit matters” amid economic uncertainties as U.S. tariffs hit the global trading system. “The biggest contest we face isn’t between political parties, it’s Singapore vs the world,” Wong said in a Facebook post earlier this week. “Our mission ... is clear: to keep our nation a shining beacon of stability, progress and hope.” While Singapore has flourished as one of the world’s wealthiest nations, it has also become one of the most expensive cities to live in. The PAP has been criticized for tight government control and a government-knows-best stance, media censorship and the use of oppressive laws against dissidents. Issues like widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding caused by immigration and restrictions on free speech have also loosened the PAP’s grip on power.","Singapore dissolves parliament, paving the way for May 3 general election",,AP News,2025-04-15T03:22:13,2025-04-15T04:59:12,gemini-2.0-flash

""The Oman talks are one of dozens of tasks for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"" the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said in his meeting withÂ		  																																																																					 a group of high-ranking officials from three branches of the Iranian government on Tuesday. The Leader of the Islamic Revolution also said thatÂ		  																																																																					 the country's issues must not be tied to the talks. ""We are neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic about these talks,""Â		  																																																																					 Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said while referring to the first round of indirect negotiations between Tehran and Washington in Oman on Saturday. After all, it is a decision and a move that has been made and has been implemented well in the first steps, theÂ		  																																																																					 Leader noted. He continued, ""Of course, we are very pessimistic about the other side, but we are optimistic about our own abilities."" Recalling the mistakes made during the JCPOA agreement in 2015,Â		  																																																																					 the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said, ""The mistake we made in the JCPOA should not be repeated."" ""During the JCPOA, we conditioned the country and made everything dependent on the progress of the negotiations,"" he said. ""Investors will not invest when they see that the country is dependent onÂ		  																																																																					 negotiation,"" he underlined. â		  																																																																					 ¢The negotiations may or may not yield results. We are neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic about them. Of course, we are very skeptical of the other party, but confident in our own capabilities,â		  																																																																					 the Leader said. â		  																																																																					 ¢The removal of the sanctions is not in our hands, but neutralizing them is; there are many ways and [there is] great domestic capacity to do that. If this objective is achieved, the country will become impervious to sanctions,â		  																																																																					 the Leader said. Ayatollah Khamenei said the first steps in the current talks with the United States have proceeded satisfactorily. He urged officials to continue the negotiations with similar care hereafter. The remarks came after Iran and the US held talks in the Omani capital last Saturday, with Oman's foreign minister functioning as the mediator, according to Press TV. The Islamic Republic has asserted that the talks were solely aimed at addressing the USâ		  																																																																					 ™s illegal and unilateral sanctions against the country, and various aspects of the Iranian nuclear energy program, strongly rejecting speculation about the processâ		  																																																																					 ™s involving other issues. The United States lifted some of the sanctions as per the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a historical 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers. Washington, however, returned the bans three years after conclusion of the deal, and even began piling up more coercive measures on the Islamic Republic. The US has termed the adversarial approach as â		  																																																																					 œmaximum pressure,â		  																																																																					 which has also seen American officialsâ		  																																																																					 ™ repeatedly threatening to use military force against the Iranian soil. The Islamic Republic has, meanwhile, underscored that any direct negotiations with the US were neither useful nor acceptable for Tehran as long as Washington retained its hostile policies.

https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/312205-presidency-hezbollah-discussing-weapons-in-bilateral-dialogue,"President Joseph Aoun said Monday that the disarmament of the militant group Hezbollah will come through negotiations as part of a national defense strategy and not through ""force.""
The Lebanese government has made a decision that ""weapons will only be in the hands of the state,"" but there are ""discussions around how to implement this decision,"" Aoun said in an interview with Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera.
Those discussions are in the form of a ""bilateral dialogue"" between the presidency and Hezbollah, he said.
Lebanon has been under pressure by the United States to speed up the disarmament of Hezbollah but there are fears within Lebanon that forcing the issue could lead to civil conflict.
""Civil peace is a red line for me,"" Aoun said.
Aoun said the Lebanese army — of which he was formerly commander — is ""doing its duty"" in confiscating weapons and dismantling unauthorized military facilities in southern Lebanon, as outlined in the ceasefire agreement that ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in late November, and sometimes in areas farther north.

The Harbin public security bureau said that the three operatives -- Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson -- had been engaged in cyberattacks targeting the Asian Winter Games held in the city in February. Investigations by Chinese technical teams revealed that the cyberattacks were carried out by the Office of Tailored Access Operations of the NSA. To conceal the origins of its attacks and secure its cyber weapons, the office used multiple affiliated front organizations to purchase IP addresses from various countries and anonymously rented servers located in regions including Europe and Asia. Investigations revealed that the NSA focused its pre-event cyberattacks on critical systems of the Asian Winter Games, including registration, arrival management, and competition entry platforms, authorities said. These systems, essential for pre-event operations, stored vast amounts of sensitive personal data of individuals associated with the Games. From Feb 3, coinciding with the first ice hockey match, NSA cyberattacks peaked, primarily targeting critical operational systems such as the event's official information platforms. These systems were vital for ensuring the smooth running of the Games, and the NSA attempted to disrupt them to undermine their normal operations. Meanwhile, the NSA launched cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in Heilongjiang province, including energy, transportation, water resources, telecommunications, and defense research institutions, authorities said. Technical teams also discovered that during the Asian Winter Games, the NSA transmitted unknown encrypted data packets to specific devices running Microsoft Windows operating systems within the province. These packets are suspected to have been attempts to activate or trigger pre-implanted backdoors in the Windows systems, authorities added. Further investigations revealed that the three NSA operatives had repeatedly launched cyberattacks against China's critical information infrastructure and participated in cyber operations targeting companies such as Huawei. Technical teams also uncovered evidence implicating the University of California and Virginia Tech in the coordinated cyber campaign against the Asian Winter Games, authorities stated.",Chinese police put 3 US operatives on wanted list over cyberattacks,Xinhua,China Daily,,4/15/25 9:13,gemini-2.0-flash

""We plan to draw up a supplementary budget in the 12 trillion-won range, which is about 2 trillion won more than previously proposed, after taking into account various opinions from the National Assembly and media,"" Choi said during a meeting with economy-related ministers. The government had earlier proposed the supplementary budget to address what Choi described as the ""most pressing issues,"" including recovery efforts following recent wildfires that devastated southeastern regions of the country. The proposal also comes amid heightened trade tensions, exacerbated by the United States' imposition of reciprocal tariffs, including a 25 percent duty for South Korea. Choi said the revised budget will allocate more than 3 trillion won for natural disaster response, more than 4 trillion won to address changes in the global trade environment and another 4 trillion won to support small businesses and vulnerable groups. He also underscored the need for continued cooperation with the National Assembly, highlighting the urgency of the proposal. ""Timing is of the essence when it comes to supplementary budgets,"" Choi said, urging bipartisan support for the swift passage of the bill.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8k67028e6o,"Bangladeshi authorities have issued an arrest warrant for the British MP and former Labour minister Tulip Siddiq. The country's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has been investigating allegations Siddiq illegally received land as part of its wider probe of the regime of her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, who was deposed as prime minister in August. The Hampstead and Highgate MP, who quit as economic secretary to the Treasury in January, was named in the arrest warrant alongside more than 50 others. Lawyers acting for Siddiq denied the charges, which they said were ""politically motivated"". The ACC had not presented any evidence or informed Siddiq about an arrest warrant, the lawyers added. The UK lists Bangladesh as a 2B extradition country - meaning clear evidence must be presented before ministers and judges make a decision. The ACC is examining claims Sheikh Hasina and her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. The investigation is based on a series of allegations made by Bobby Hajjaj, a political opponent of Hasina. Court documents seen by the BBC show Hajjaj has accused Siddiq of helping to broker a deal with Russia in 2013 that overinflated the price of a new nuclear power plant in Bangladesh. In a statement seen by the BBC, Siddiq's lawyers Stephenson Harwood said: ""The allegations are completely false and have been dealt with in writing by Siddiq's lawyers. ""The ACC has not responded to Siddiq or put any allegations to her directly or through her lawyers. ""Siddiq knows nothing about a hearing in Dhaka relating to her and she has no knowledge of any arrest warrant that is said to have been issued. ""To be clear, there is no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means. ""She has never had a plot of land in Bangladesh, and she has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else. ""No evidence has been provided by the ACC to support this or any other allegation made against Siddiq, and it is clear to us that the charges are politically motivated."" Before resigning, Siddiq had referred herself to the PM's ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus when the corruption allegations first surfaced. Sir Laurie said in his report that he had ""not identified evidence of improprieties"". But he added it was ""regrettable"" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the ""potential reputational risks"" of the ties to her aunt Sheikh Hasina, the deposed prime minister of Bangladesh and leader of Awami League party. ACC chairman Mohammad Abdul Momen has previously told the BBC the allegations ""are by no means 'targeted and baseless'"" and its investigation was ""based on documentary evidence of corruption"". ""Tulip Siddiq must not shy away from the court proceedings in Bangladesh. ""I would welcome Siddiq come and defend her case and with the best possible legal support accompanying her,"" he added. He also rejected her lawyer's claims that the ACC was interfering in UK politics, adding: ""ACC briefing to the media is a regular phenomenon, it is delivered professionally and with all accuracy."" A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""If it is the case that Keir Starmer's choice for anti-corruption minister is the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP. ""It is shocking that Keir Starmer believes 'the door remains open' for Ms Siddiq returning to a government position.""

https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthis-us-airstrikes-israel-hamas-war-f37d6c5e878045efd48d3790fe69aef7,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Suspected U.S. airstrikes around Yemen’s rebel-held capital killed at least seven people and wounded 29 overnight, the Houthis said Monday as they also claimed shooting down another American MQ-9 Reaper drone. Since its start nearly a month ago, the intense campaign of U.S. airstrikes under President Donald Trump targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters — related to the Israel-Hamas war — has killed over 120 people, according to casualty figures released Monday by the Houthis’ Health Ministry. Footage aired by the Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel showed firefighters spraying water on a raging fire they described as being sparked by the airstrikes. Rubble littered a street as rescuers carried one person away from the site, which the rebels claimed was a ceramics factory in the Bani Matar neighborhood of Sanaa, the capital. The Associated Press could not independently verify what was struck. The U.S. military’s Central Command, which oversees American military operations, did not acknowledge the strikes. That follows a pattern for the command, which now has authorization from the White House to conduct strikes at will in the campaign that began March 15. The American military also hasn’t been providing any information on targets hit. The White House has said over 200 strikes have been conducted so far. Intense airstrikes overnight into Tuesday also struck areas of Hodeida, al-Jawaf and Marib governorates, the Houthis said, without offering any casualty information. Houthis claim another American drone shot down The Houthis separately claimed Sunday night they shot down an MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen’s Hajjah governorate, which sits to the northwest of the country on the Red Sea on the country’s border with Saudi Arabia. Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, described the downing in a prerecorded video message as the fourth in two weeks by the rebels. Saree said the rebels targeted the drone with “a locally manufactured missile.” The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles — such as the Iranian missile known as the 358 — capable of downing aircraft. Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo. General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and remain in the air for over 30 hours. They have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA for years over Afghanistan, Iraq and now Yemen. Central Command said it was aware of “reports” of the drone being shot down but did not elaborate. US strikes come as part of monthlong intense campaign An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities. The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted. The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success. The U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. “What we’re doing with the Houthis and what we’re doing in the region, we’ve shown a capability to go far, to go deep and to go big,” U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Sunday on Fox News. “We don’t want to do that. But if we have to, we will to prevent a nuclear bomb in Iran’s hands.” Hegseth added: “We know Iran ... is taking a look at what’s happening to the Houthis and realizing they don’t want any part of it.”","Suspected US airstrikes kill 7 in Yemen, Houthis say",Jon Gambrell,AP News,2025-04-13T22:25:23,2025-04-14T02:01:39,gemini-2.0-flash

The attacks came despite the US pushing for an end of the war and holding separate talks with both Moscow and Kyiv -- and as US President Donald Trump this week said he was unhappy with Russia for “bombing like crazy.” JOIN US ON TELEGRAMFollow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official. In Odesa, several explosions were reported following air raid alerts late in the evening on Sunday, April 13. The regional military administration confirmed damage to infrastructure, including a hospital, and burning vehicles on city streets. Right now, Odesa is under attack by Russian kamikaze drones.The drones are striking vehicles while they’re moving. There are also reports of a hit on a hospital. Odesa Mayor Hennady Trukhanov and regional officials urged residents to remain in shelters as the drone assault unfolded. Ukraine’s Air Force reported the movement of Iranian-made Shahed drones from the Black Sea toward the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions prior to the strikes. In Kharkiv, a drone strike early Monday hit a civilian enterprise in the Saltivskyi district, sparking a large fire that spread across roughly 1,000 square meters. Local authorities said food storage facilities were damaged, and nearby residential buildings also suffered blast damage. No casualties were reported in Kharkiv. Emergency services continue to assess the damage and respond at both sites.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r5vlwj4dqo,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has invited Donald Trump to visit his country before any deal is struck with Russia to end the war. ""Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,"" Zelensky said in an interview for CBS's 60 Minutes programme. The interview was recorded before a Russian missile hit the city of Sumy on Sunday, killing 35 people and injuring 117 others. Without providing evidence, Russia said it fired two Iskander missiles at a meeting of Ukrainian soldiers, killing 60 of them. Trump said he had been told it was a mistake, without specifying who told him. At the scene in Sumy, the conference centre Russia claimed was used for the meeting is smashed, and a crater marks the spot where a missile hit. The roof is no more. Kyiv has not confirmed the gathering of military officers – however, a regional mayor in Sumy has demanded the resignation of local security officials if indeed they allowed such a meeting to happen. Any gathering of soldiers is a prime target for Russia. In previous attacks and indeed throughout the invasion of Ukraine, civilians have been seen as acceptable collateral damage by the Russian military. The attack comes as the US, Ukraine's strongest military ally, has been pursuing an end to the war - now in its fourth year - through negotiation under Trump. Asked about the attack, the US president said it was ""terrible"" and that he had been ""told they made a mistake"", but did not elaborate. Earlier, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, retired Lt-Gen Keith Kellogg, said the attack had crossed ""any line of decency"". However, it remains to be seen if Trump will accept Zelensky's invitation. Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, is the only senior member of Trump's team to visit Kyiv, and that was to demand Zelensky sign a contract heavily weighted in Washington's favour to trade Ukraine's mineral wealth for continued military aid. Zelensky refused. The Ukrainian president has highlighted Russia's continued attacks on civilians while Trump attempts to improve relations with Moscow in search of a ceasefire. US special envoy Steve Witkoff has already held three meetings with Vladimir Putin, and Kyiv is adamant Moscow will exploit this as it continues to erode Ukraine's territory. European leaders condemned the Sumy attack. Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, told the country's public broadcaster ARD the attack constituted a ""serious war crime"". ""It was a perfidious act.. and it is a serious war crime, deliberate and intended,"" the conservative politician said. Germany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said the attack showed ""just what Russia's supposed readiness for peace [was] worth"". French President Emmanuel Macron accused Russia of ""blatant disregard of human lives, international law, and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump"". ""Strong measures are needed to impose a ceasefire on Russia,"" he said. ""France is working tirelessly toward this goal, alongside its partners."" Describing the attack as ""barbaric"", European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen added: ""Russia was and remains the aggressor, in blatant violation of international law. ""Strong measures are urgently needed to enforce a ceasefire. Europe will continue to reach out to partners and maintain strong pressure on Russia until the bloodshed ends and a just and lasting peace is achieved, on Ukraine's terms and conditions."" British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also gave a view, saying he was ""appalled at Russia's horrific attacks on civilians in Sumy"". A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was ""deeply alarmed and shocked"" to learn of the missile attack. ""Attacks against civilians and civilian objects are prohibited under international humanitarian law, and that any such attacks, wherever they occur, must end immediately"", he added. Guterres stressed the UN's support for ""meaningful efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive peace that fully upholds Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity"". Sunday's double missile strike was the deadliest attack on civilians in Ukraine this year. Another Russian missile attack, earlier this month on 4 April, killed 20 people and injured 61 in the city of Kryvyi Rih. On that occasion, Russia's defence ministry said it had targeted a meeting of ""unit commanders and Western instructors"" in a restaurant. No evidence was provided. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The UN estimates that nearly seven million Ukrainians are currently living as refugees. The conflict goes back more than a decade, to 2014, when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown. Russia then annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed insurgents in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c807p2xjj8zo,"Downing Street has said it is ""confident"" the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces at British Steel's Scunthorpe site switched on will reach it in time. The government has been attempting to source the materials needed to fuel the plant's central blast furnaces since taking control of it on Saturday, and has confirmed a shipment will arrive ""in the coming days"". Ministers seized control of operations after talks with British Steel's Chinese owner Jingye broke down, and the government accused the firm of planning to switch the furnaces off. Beijing has accused the British government of ""politicising trade co-operation"", and said the move raised doubts about investment in the UK. Officials had been attempting to obtain the coking coal and iron pellets needed to keep the steel-producing furnaces running – materials which ministers have accused Jingye of selling off. Speaking during a visit to the site on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said ""everything is in place"" for the furnaces to continue to fire after the materials were secured. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman had earlier confirmed that two shipments of both materials are being held at Immingham docks, 30 miles east of Scunthorpe, and will reach the steelworks first, while a third shipment of raw materials is onboard a vessel off the coast of Africa that is making its way to the UK. Sourcing and transporting the raw materials to the Scunthorpe plant is critical because if a blast furnace goes out, in most cases it is unable to be restarted. Even its temperature dropping too low can cause permanent damage. An emergency law was rushed through Parliament on Saturday, giving the government control of the Lincolnshire site after it ""became clear"" that Jingye was intent on shutting the site. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the House of Commons that Jingye had intended to ""cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders"" of raw materials, and therefore ""irrevocably and unilaterally closed down"" the plant. On Monday, the government appointed two long-standing British Steel employees to run the plant on an interim basis. The situation at British Steel has raised questions about Chinese investment in industries the UK government has deemed strategically critical. Treasury minister James Murray told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, while Jingye had ""clearly behaved irresponsibly"", the actions of one firm did not ""speak to all companies who are based in China"". He also said there needed to be a ""high level of scrutiny"" for any foreign investment in critical infrastructure. The UK government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership, but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations at Scunthorpe. While Rayner said the government wanted to work with the company to continue production at the site, as well as explore alternative private investment, she said no option was off the table. China's embassy in the UK has urged ministers to negotiate with Jingye to ""find a solution acceptable to all parties"", while its foreign ministry urged the UK government to hold further talks with Jingye. Spokesman Lin Jian said: ""It is hoped that the British government will... avoid politicising trade cooperation or linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK for normal investment,"" according to news agency AFP. On Monday morning, Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community Union - which represents the majority of steelworkers - said the blast furnaces are ""in a far better position"" than before the government stepped in. Mr Rickhuss told Today he was certain the plant would remain running and that the furnaces were ""secure"". Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, from the GMB Union, told BBC Breakfast that she had spoken to British Steel on Sunday night and had been reassured the raw materials would be secured by the government. The Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people and is the last site in the UK that can produce virgin steel - a high-grade product which is needed for large construction projects. Without the plant, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make virgin steel - which the government believes would pose a risk to the country's economic security. The site produces the majority of rail tracks used by Network Rail. The company said it does not expect ""any impact on the continued delivery of reliable rail services"" as it built up a stockpile of steel in anticipation of the plant's possible closure. The virgin steel made in Scunthorpe is also critical for large-scale infrastructure developments, such as building nuclear power plants like the ongoingHinkley Point C project in Somerset. However, in March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe site was losing Â£700,000 a day, which it said was ""no longer financially sustainable"", and the company began a consultation on job cuts. Talks with Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough. The government said the company had demanded more than double the government's original Â£500m offer with few guarantees it would keep the plant open. Speaking about the company's actions on Sunday, Reynolds said ""it might not be sabotage, it might be neglect"". Rayner said there was ""no evidence"" of corporate sabotage. The Conservatives have criticised the government for not stepping in sooner to save the plant. Tory shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the party had supported the emergency law because ""it's the least worst option on the table"".",British Steel: Government 'confident' Scunthorpe furnaces can be kept firing  ,"Maia Davies, Adam Durbin & Emma Rossiter",BBC News,2025-04-13T21:19:28,2025-04-14T14:17:30,gemini-2.0-flash

An Israeli official told the news site that US envoy Steve Witkoff briefed Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer on the talks, which Israel is wary of supporting. According to the report, the Trump administration emerged satisfied from the first round of talks in Oman this weekend, which marked the highest-level dialogue between US and Iranian officials in eight years.

https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/13/russia-was-and-remains-the-aggressor-says-von-der-leyen-following-deadly-attack-on-ukraine,"European leaders took to social media on Sunday to condemn Russia's latest deadly attack on the Ukrainian city of Sumy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote that ""Russian cruelty struck again,"" calling the attack ""barbaric"" in a post on X. More than 30 people were killed in the missile strike as people gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, according to officials. Images from the scene showed lines of black body bags lying on the side of the road, while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris. Video footage also showed fire crews as they fought to extinguish the shells of burned-out cars among the rubble from damaged buildings. A further 99 people were injured, including 11 children, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. Von der Leyen added that ""Russia was and remains the aggressor, in blatant violation of international law."" The attack on Sumy is the second large-scale attack to claim such a high number of civilian lives in just over a week. A deadly missile strike on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih on 4 April killed some 20 people, including nine children. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said that the Sumy attack crossed “any line of decency” and that the White House remained committed to ending the conflict. “There are scores of civilian dead and wounded. As a former military leader, I understand targeting and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war,"" he said. Zelenskyy also called for a global response to the attack. “Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs. What’s needed is an attitude toward Russia that a terrorist deserves,” he said. EU Foreign Chief Kaja Kallas also condemned the attack on social media, writing of a ""horrific example of Russia intensifying attacks while Ukraine has accepted an unconditional ceasefire."" French President Emmanuel Macron said that the strike undermined Washington-led peace talks between the two sides. “Everyone knows: This war was initiated by Russia alone. And today, it is clear that Russia alone chooses to continue it — with blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump,” he wrote in a statement. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ""appalled at Russia's horrific attacks on civilians."" The strikes come a day after Russia and Ukraine’s senior diplomats accused each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the three-year war. Russian forces hold the advantage in Ukraine, and Kyiv has warned Moscow is planning a fresh spring offensive to ramp up pressure on its foe and improve its negotiating position. Ukraine has endorsed a broader US ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet.","Russia 'was and remains the aggressor', says Von der Leyen following deadly attack on Ukraine's Sumy",Emma De Ruiter,Euronews,2025-04-13T12:43:01,2025-04-13T12:43:01,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-850005,"The family of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander approved the publication of Hamas’s propaganda video of him on Sunday, which was released before Passover. In the video, Alexander blames the Israeli government and the American administration for “deserting” him in Gaza, saying, “I am collapsing physically and mentally.” “I am collapsing because of this disgusting world and disgusting Israeli government,” Alexander says. “Every day, I see that he – [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu – controls the country like a dictator,” he continues. “I am collapsing physically and mentally. “I heard that three weeks ago, Hamas was prepared to release me, but you refused and abandoned me here!” he exclaimed “Tell me why. Why am I not at home? Why am I filming my second video? Why?” Alexander asked. “Everyone is lying to me: My people, the Israeli government, the American government, the army, and everyone else,” he said. “I want to believe I will return home to celebrate the holidays with you.” Edan then turns and directly addresses US President Donald Trump. “President Trump, I believed in you. I believed you would free me alive. Why have you fallen victim to Netanyahu’s lies? “Every day I hear my mother’s voice, my father’s voice, my little brother’s voice. Every day, I see the citizens of Israel demonstrating, they are doing everything in their power [to help us] and the world doesn’t listen to them,” he said. “I came to Israel to serve in the Golani Brigade. I am a lone soldier. On October 7, I was left alone at the post against an entire army!” Alexander said. “I want to believe this video will not be the last time you see me alive. I want to return to the people of Israel safely. Keep demonstrating and doing everything you can.” Netanyahu spoke with Edan’s parents Yael and Adi on Sunday evening following the release of Hamas’s propaganda video. He told the family that he sympathizes with their pain and informed them that a tremendous effort is currently underway to return Edan and all the hostages home. Yael and Adi issued the following statement in response to Hamas’s video release last night: “Our son Edan’s love for Israel led him to leave his comfortable life in New Jersey and join the IDF. On October 7, he stood his ground alone at his military post, trying to protect nearby communities from Hamas terrorists. Now he remains alone in tunnels, in enemy hands. Each moment grows more unbearable. You can see it in his face – his fear, his desperation.” “For 555 days – over a year and a half – through two Passovers, two Festivals of Freedom, our son remains captive. President Trump, our hope and trust rest with you now. We implore you to use your leadership and negotiation skills to secure a deal that will bring all 59 hostages back to their families – including our son, Edan, and the other American citizens.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp6zeymevo,"A 38-year-old man has been arrested and is due to be charged following an alleged arson attack on the official residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, authorities have said. Cody Balmer faces charges of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault. The arrest came hours after Shapiro, often touted as a future White House contender, woke up in the middle of the night to authorities banging on the door of his home as a fire spread. At a news conference on Sunday, Shapiro said he was ""obviously emotional"" as he recalled what had happened. The Democrat and his family were able to evacuate unscathed, but their home in the state capital of Harrisburg was severely damaged. ""I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempted to put on me by attacking us as they did last night,"" he told reporters. Hours before the fire, Shapiro and his family had celebrated the first night of Passover, a Jewish holiday, at home. ""When we were in the state dining room last night, we told the story of Passover,"" he said - adding that Balmer's motives were not known. Police Deputy Commissioner George Bivens said the suspect had a homemade incendiary device in his possession and was arrested in the Harrisburg area. Authorities believe the suspect was able to hop a fence surrounding the home and get inside to start the blaze, which is still being investigated. State authorities said the blaze - which was extinguished - had caused ""a significant amount of damage to a portion of the residence"". The governor and his family were in a different part of the brick home when the fire was set, police explained. The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire said it had worked to put out the blaze while police focused on evacuating Shapiro and his family. Authorities had offered a $10,000 (Â£7,600) reward for information that led to any arrest. It is unclear whether a tip led to the arrest of Balmer, who remains in custody. Shapiro and his wife, Lori, have four children together: Sophia, Jonah, Max and Reuben. The governor was considered as a possible running mate for former Vice-President Kamala Harris during her run for president last year. She ultimately chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. The Pennsylvania Governor's Residence, in Harrisburg, is a 29,000 sq ft Georgian-style home from 1968 that has housed eight governors. Shapiro has served as Pennsylvania's governor since 2023, after working as the state's attorney general.",Josh Shapiro: Man arrested after alleged arson attack at governor's home,Christal Hayes,BBC News,2025-04-13T11:56:09,2025-04-13T20:56:12,gemini-2.0-flash

April 13 (Yonhap) — The presidential primary of the Democratic Party (DP) is shaping up to be a four-way race, with former party leader Lee Jae-myung expected to dominate given his strong grip on the party leadership, experts said Sunday. Last week, Lee officially declared his candidacy for the June 3 presidential election, following the ouster of former President Yoon Suk Yeol after his martial law declaration. Lee is expected to compete against three candidates in the party primary -- former lawmaker and Interior Minister Kim Doo-kwan, Gyeonggi Gov. Kim Dong-yeon and former South Gyeongsang Gov. Kim Kyoung-soo. As Lee is widely considered the front-runner in the upcoming presidential election, the party race is largely expected to be a contest between Lee and the three Kims from the non-Lee faction, with Lee likely to dominate. ""As the period of the party primary is quite short due to the snap election, the primary itself does not hold much significance for the overall presidential race. The start of the primary marks the beginning of our competition with the People Power Party,"" a DP official said. It marked Lee's third presidential bid, following 2017 and 2022. He lost the presidential race to Yoon by a thin margin three years ago.

The suspension of tariffs on a range of products from electric vehicle batteries to agave syrup extends until July 2027, the government said in a statement. The move is part of a wider drive to protect British firms from United States President Donald Trump's tariffs, including an increase in state-backed loans for companies, the Telegraph reported. The British government claims the initiative will save U.K. businesses Â£17 million, which could be passed on to consumers. The U.K. was slammed with 10 percent U.S. tariffs across the board on April 2, on top of 25 percent duties on aluminum, steel, vehicles and car parts. On Saturday, the House of Lords approved emergency legislation giving the government the power to bring the last remaining source of virgin steel in the U.K., British Steel, under state control. The U.S. is the second-most important export market for British steel after the European Union. Starmer has said the U.K. will â	keep calm and fight for the best deal with the U.S.â	 while also working with other countries to reduce trade barriers. Under the tariff plan announced Sunday, the products that will now face zero import duties when entering the U.K. also include pasta, canned pineapples, fruit juice, coconut oil, plywood and plastics.",UK suspends some tariffs to help firms cope with Trump’s trade war,Eliza Gkritsi,POLITICO,2025-04-13T10:48:06,2025-04-13T11:18:24,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/japan-osaka-expo-us-trade-05c228709f4814ff4a6e74703bf3ff16,"OSAKA, Japan (AP) — The Expo 2025 opened in Osaka on Sunday with more than 10,000 people singing Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony to celebrate the start of the six-month event that Japan hopes will unite the world divided by tensions and wars. Here is what to know about the Expo 2025 Osaka: What is Expo 2025 Osaka about? The Osaka Expo is held at Yumeshima, which means “dream island,” a reclaimed industrial waste burial site in the Osaka Bay, where participants from more than 160 countries, regions and organizations showcase their futuristic exhibits inside about 80 pavillons of unique architecture. “Creating a future society for our lives” is the main theme. It is Osaka’s second Expo after the hugely successful 1970 event that attracted 64 million visitors, a record until Shanghai in 2010. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports the Osaka Expo opens in Japan offering a vision of the future. Organizers expect 28 million visitors through mid-October, though ticket sales have been slow, with about 9 million sold in advance, short of an initial target of 14 million. “It’s been 55 years since the last Expo in Osaka. I’ve been looking forward to it,” said Daiki Chiba, who traveled from from Sendai, about 900 kilometers (560 miles) northeast of Osaka. Many visitors carried Myaku-Myaku mascots or wore clothes matching its colors — red, blue and white — to get in the mood. What does it mean to hold Expo amid global tensions The Expo comes only four years after Japan struggled to host the no-audience Tokyo Olympics during the coronavirus pandemic. It opens in the wake of trade wars and fears of a global economic downturn sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, the three-year Russian invasion of Ukraine and Middle East conflicts. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba compared the global tensions to a “national crisis” and said that Trump’s tariffs, especially the 25% duty on automobiles, would be a blow to all industries and Japan’s economy. Still, Japan wants to turn the pinch into a chance. “I think the timing is actually quite fitting,” said Sachiko Yoshimura, head of Expo 2025 global communications. “Holding the Expo now could eventually help to address the divisions in the world. ... I believe this Expo in Japan might actually lead to stronger international relationships and improvements.” What is the Grand Ring? The iconic ring, designed by architect Sou Fujimoto, is a lattice-like structure encircling the venue and recognized by the Guinness World Records as the largest wooden architecture. It is 20 meters (65 feet) high and has a 2-kilometer (1.2-mile) circumference. The costly ring takes up more than 14% of the Expo’s total spending of 235 billion yen ($1.64 billion) and has triggered public criticism. The total cost nearly doubled from the initial estimate largely due to the weaker yen, causing construction delays. Several pavilions, including those of Nepal, India, Vietnam and Chile, were not ready for the opening. The ring is supposed to be partially reusable, reflecting the theme of creating a sustainable future. What are other highlights? Exhibits of cutting-edge technology, such as robots and flying cars, as well as pop culture like Hello Kitty and Gundam, are among the highlights. “Pavilions all look amazing,” said Laurel Sylvester from New Zealand, visiting with her husband and two children. Her family is interested in ocean sustainability and planned to visit the Blue Ocean Dome. She said the boys are “super excited to have their photo with the (big Gundam) robot and some of the interesting tech things that are going on.” A small artificial heart made from induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS, demonstrated a heartbeat at a Japanese health care pavilion. At the Future of Life pavilion, visitors can interact with robots. A human washing machine that was a sensation at the 1970 expo returned with a high-tech makeover. The U.S. pavilion focuses on space travel. Its lunar stone from the Apollo 12 mission, a sensation at the 1970 expo, was back on display. China, also highlighting space technology, exhibits soil samples from its lunar missions. Carrying a “Not for sale” sign and decorated with its blue-and-yellow national flags, Ukraine attracted many visitors with a globe and other items carrying barcodes. By scanning them, visitors can see videos showing people’s lives at war and their reconstruction effort. Dymtro Liuyi, Ukrainian creative director, said his country’s participation was undecided until December due to the war. The preparation was finished Sunday morning, he said, showing blue paint on his fingers. What is Myaku-Myaku? With its blue face encircled by red balls, some of them eyeballs, the mysterious, smiley creature Myaku-Myaku welcomes visitors. The imaginary creature was born from the fusion of cells and water in a small spring in the Kansai region, organizers say. The friendly but clumsy character can transform into various shapes and is good at finding a rainbow after the rain. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.",Osaka Expo opens in Japan offering a vision of the future.

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/04/13/2003835086,"State-owned oil refiner CPC Corp, Taiwan (CPC, 台灣中油) plans to boost its procurement of US energy products — including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil — in response to US President Donald Trump’s 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese exports, sources said yesterday. President William Lai (賴清德) has said the government intends to expand purchases of US goods, including agricultural, industrial, and energy products, as part of its strategy to narrow the trade balance. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said it aims for US-sourced LNG to account for 30 percent of Taiwan’s total LNG imports. Last year, US LNG made up 10 percent of CPC’s imports, with the company sourcing from 14 different countries, the ministry said. CPC sources said the target could be met by ramping up existing LNG imports from the US or seeking new supply channels, such as LNG from Alaska. The company said it has inked a term sheet with select US firms certifying its intent to import LNG from Alaska, although the project could take five to seven years to come online. The company said that major US energy firms maintain diversified global investments and that it has an understanding with its partners to adjust delivery volumes based on demand and evolving circumstances. It also said it confirmed it would significantly increase LNG imports from the US over the next four years. It also plans to raise its purchases of US crude oil to help ensure a stable energy supply for the country. The company said it primarily imports sweet crude oil, or crude with a lower sulfur content, from the US and African countries, adding that sweet crude, while more expensive, was more environmentally friendly. It is also importing sour crude, or crude with higher sulfur content, from the Middle East, it added. While the company had been considering scaling back US sweet crude imports due to declining domestic demand for gasoline and diesel, it is now reassessing that decision in light of the government’s push for net-zero emissions and broader energy diversification policies. US-sourced crude has already increased from 44 percent to 60 percent of CPC’s total imports over the past three years. The rise was partly due to a fire at the company’s Dalin refinery’s heavy oil desulfurization unit on Oct. 27, 2022. The Dalin facility has since been repaired and is expected to resume operations shortly, CPC said.",CPC to boost LNG imports to narrow trade balance,"Liu Ching-hua, Jake Chung",Taipei Times,2025-04-13T00:00:00,2025-04-13T00:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash

Nikita Casap, 17, was arrested in March and charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of hiding a corpse, according to Waukesha County authorities. Other charges include theft of property over $10,000 and misappropriating ID to obtain money. Court documents show investigators are pursuing federal charges including conspiracy, presidential assassination and use of weapons of mass destruction. The teen's stepfather, Donald Mayer, 51, and mother, Tatiana Casap, 35, were both found dead inside their home by the Waukesha County Sheriff's Department on March 1, according to a press release from the department. The sheriff's department issued a search warrant and say they found material on the teen's phone related to ""The Order of Nine Angles,"" which is ""a network of individuals holding new-Nazi racially motivated extremist views,"" according to investigators. The Federal Bureau of Investigation reviewed documents allegedly written by the teen,	which calls for the assassination of Trump and the start of a revolution to ""save the white race,"" according to federal court documents. The alleged writings shows images of Adolf Hitler with the following text: ""HAIL HITLER HAIL THE WHITE RACE HAIL VICTORY,"" according to court documents. ""He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States. And he paid for, at least in part, a drone and explosives to be used as a weapon of mass destruction to commit an attack,"" investigators said in the federal affidavit. ""Other parties, with whom Casap was in contact, appear to have been aware of his plan and action and to have provided assistance to Casap in carrying them out,"" according to the affidavit. Casap was in court on April 9 for a preliminary hearing on his state charges. He has not yet offered a plea and remains in custody.

https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-war-recruitment-soars-with-record-bonuses/33383051.html,"Russian recruitment for men to fight in Ukraine is soaring in many of the country's regions, with signing bonuses and other incentives reaching new records in some places. In Siberian regions like Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, local authorities have aggressively pushed contracts on potential volunteers, and signing bonuses in some places exceed average annual salaries, according to recruits and official advertising campaigns. Sergei, who asked that his real name not be used and that his specific town in the Irkutsk region not be disclosed, said that, when he showed up at a recruiting office, he was immediately shown into a room and handed a brochure with ""big, red figure"" on the front: 1.4 million rubles ($16,700). ""It's supposedly what they’re paying you to go die. Or kill. Depends how it turns out, I guess,"" he told RFE's Siberia Realities. Russian officials have not released casualty figures since 2022, but Western estimates put the number of Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the all-out invasion in February 2022 at more than 790,000. The bulk of those casualties have occurred as a result of the battlefield tactics that Russian commanders have relied on: front infantry assaults, sometimes on foot, sometimes on motorcycles, that seek to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses. Extraordinarily High Wages And Benefits To replenish personnel, authorities have relied heavily on extraordinarily high wages and benefits to attract volunteers to fight in Ukraine. The signing bonuses typically are a mix of federal and local payments. Authorities in Moscow have also pressured regional leaders to meet quotas for new volunteers. In Iskitim, a town near the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, a woman who asked to be called Galina said she visited her local recruiting office on behalf of her nephew, who had previously been rejected for medical reasons.

In a press statement signed by the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kimiebi Imomotimi Ebienfa, the government said: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs observes with concerns a recent social media publication by the United States Embassy, Abuja, regarding the security situation in Nigeria and the testimonies provided by Bishop Wilfred Anagbe and Rev. Fr. Remigius Ihyula, on the unfortunate alleged threats that have arisen as a result of their testimonies at the U.S. Congressional Hearing on Religious Persecution in Nigeria. “Though their testimonies misrepresent facts and oversimplification of a deeply complex national challenge, the religious leaders are entitled to their opinions, freedom of expression, and association as enshrined in Nigeria’s constitution.” The Ministry described as “both inaccurate and unfair” the assertion that the Nigerian government has “allowed the violence to escalate unchecked.” “The government has consistently taken decisive actions, including deploying security forces to areas affected by communal violence, engaging in peace-building efforts between farmers and herders, strengthening intelligence operations to track down criminal elements, and implementing policies to address root causes, including land use reforms and economic development initiatives,” it said. “It is important to state that, while challenges remain, it is incorrect to suggest that the Nigerian government has been inactive or indifferent. The reality is that Nigeria is fighting multiple security threats, including banditry, terrorism, and organized crime, all of which affect different communities irrespective of religion.” The statement reaffirmed Nigeria’s commitment to upholding “freedom of religion and freedom of expression, among other freedoms,” and assured that “any reports of threats or intimidation against religious leaders will be investigated, and appropriate actions will be taken.” While acknowledging the concerns raised, the Ministry rejected “the portrayal of the crisis as an ‘Islamist extermination’ of Christians,” stating:”Government will continue to prioritize the protection of the lives and property of its citizens regardless of faith or ethnicity while strengthening national and international cooperation in the fight against insecurity. “We therefore call for responsible reporting that reflects the full complexity of the challenges at hand and promotes constructive dialogue rather than polarization.” Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

The two ballistic missiles hit around 10:15 a.m., officials said. Images from the scene showed lines of black body bags on the side of the road, while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris. Video footage also showed fire crews fighting to extinguish the shells of burned-out cars among the rubble from damaged buildings. The dead included two children, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a statement. A further 117 people were wounded, including 15 children, it said. “Only filthy scum can act like this — taking the lives of ordinary people,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. In a statement on social media, he said the first strike hit buildings belonging to a city university, while the second exploded above street level. The head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Andriy Yermak, said cluster munitions were used to kill as many people as possible. The Associated Press was unable to verify that claim. The attack on Sumy followed a deadly April 4 missile strike on Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih that killed some 20 people, including nine children. Zelenskyy called for a global response to the attack. “Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs. What’s needed is an attitude toward Russia that a terrorist deserves,” he said. Other world leaders also condemned the attack, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying that it undermined Washington-led peace talks between the sides. “Everyone knows: This war was initiated by Russia alone. And today, it is clear that Russia alone chooses to continue it — with blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts” of U.S. President Donald Trump, he wrote in a statement. Asking about the attack, Trump said late Sunday evening that he was trying to get the war stopped. “I think it was terrible and I was told they made a mistake, but I think it’s a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington. He did not clarify whether he was saying the attack was unintentional. Elsewhere in Ukraine, two women, ages 62 and 68, and a 48-year-old man were killed in Russian attacks on the Kherson region, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin said. Another person was killed during Russian shelling on Ukraine’s Donetsk region, Gov. Vadym Filashkin said. The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, said a Russian strike hit one of the city’s kindergartens, shattering windows and damaging the building’s facade. No casualties were reported. The strikes come a day after Russia and Ukraine’s senior diplomats accused each other of violating a tentative U.S.-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the three-year war. The two countries’ foreign ministers spoke at separate events at the annual Antalya Diplomacy Forum a day after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss peace prospects. “The Ukrainians have been attacking us from the very beginning, every passing day, maybe with two or three exceptions,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, adding that Moscow would provide the U.S., Turkey and international bodies with a list of Kyiv’s attacks during the past three weeks. His Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, contested that claim, saying Saturday that Russia had launched almost 70 missiles, over 2,200 exploding drones and more than 6,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, “mostly at civilians” since agreeing to the limited pause on strikes. Russian forces hold the advantage in Ukraine, and Kyiv has warned that Moscow is planning a fresh spring offensive to ramp up pressure on its foe and improve its negotiating position. Ukraine has endorsed a broader U.S. ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, said the Sumy attack crossed “any line of decency” and that the White House remained committed to ending the conflict. “There are scores of civilian dead and wounded.

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/underestimating-china,"Success in great-power competition requires rigorous and unsentimental net assessment. Yet the American estimation of China has lurched from one extreme to the other. For decades, Americans registered blistering economic growth, dominance of international trade, and growing geopolitical ambition, and anticipated the day when China might overtake a strategically distracted and politically paralyzed United States; after the 2008 financial crisis, and then especially at the height of the COVID pandemic, many observers believed that day had come. But the pendulum swung to the other extreme only a few years later as China’s abandonment of “zero COVID” failed to restore growth. Beijing was beset by ominous demographics, once unthinkable youth unemployment, and deepening stagnation while the United States was strengthening alliances, boasting breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and other technologies, and enjoying a booming economy with record low unemployment and record high stock markets. A new consensus took hold: that an aging, slowing, and increasingly less nimble China would not overtake an ascendant United States. Washington shifted from pessimism to overconfidence. Yet just as past bouts of defeatism were misguided, so is today’s triumphalism, which risks dangerously underestimating both the latent and actual power of the only competitor in a century whose GDP has surpassed 70 percent of that of the United States. On critical metrics, China has already outmatched the United States. Economically, it boasts twice the manufacturing capacity. Technologically, it dominates everything from electric vehicles to fourth-generation nuclear reactors and now produces more active patents and top-cited scientific publications annually. Militarily, it features the world’s largest navy, bolstered by shipbuilding capacity 200 times as large as that of the United States; vastly greater missile stocks; and the world’s most advanced hypersonic capabilities—all results of the fastest military modernization in history. Even if China’s growth slows and its system falters, it will remain formidable strategically. During the Cold War, Soviet leaders often made the point that “quantity has a quality all its own.” As productivity equalizes, nations with larger populations, broader geographic reach, and greater economic heft scale up and dominate smaller first-movers. This dynamic has held throughout most of history. The United States benefited from it during the last century. It caught the tide of European industrialization, then leveraged its continental scale and larger population to outclass the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, and ultimately the Soviet Union. Today, it is China that benefits from that dynamic and the United States is at risk of being overtaken technologically, deindustrialized economically, and defeated militarily by a rival with far greater size and productive capacity. This is an era in which strategic advantage will once again accrue to those who can operate at scale. China possesses scale, and the United States does not—at least not by itself. Because its only viable path lies in coalition with others, Washington would be particularly unwise to go it alone in a complex global competition. By retreating to a sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere, the United States would cede the rest of the world to a globally engaged China. Yet acknowledging the need for allies and partners should be the starting point, not an endpoint—because the United States’ legacy approach to alliances will no longer suffice. That approach, rooted in Cold War–era assumptions and extended by inertia over eight decades, tended to view partners as dependents: recipients of protection rather than co-creators of power. They were often seen as helpful, but also as burdensome and even obstructive. That model is obsolete. To achieve scale, Washington must transform its alliance architecture from a collection of managed relationships to a platform for integrated and pooled capacity building across the military, economic, and technological domains. In practical terms, that might mean Japan and Korea help build American ships and Taiwan builds American semiconductor plants while the United States shares its best military technology with allies, and all come together to pool their markets behind a shared tariff or regulatory wall erected against China. This kind of coherent and interoperable bloc, with the United States at its core, would generate aggregate advantages that China cannot match alone. But such an approach demands a fundamental reorientation, from command-and-control diplomacy to a new capacity-centric statecraft. This radical shift in how the United States builds and wields power is essential in a world where it no longer has the singular advantage of scale. As China plays for time and mass, the United States and its partners must play for cohesion and collective leverage. To repurpose the warning often attributed to Benjamin Franklin: we must hang together, or we will all hang separately. Not every large country becomes a great power. Size refers to dimensions; scale is the ability to use size to generate efficiency and productivity and thereby outcompete rivals. Small states can become world-class by maximizing efficiency on a small foundation, but when large states run that playbook on a much larger foundation, they can remake the world. Broader internal markets can drive down costs, enabling companies to outcompete others around the world. Bigger populations create deeper pools of talent and research. Large states are less reliant on trade, which gives them greater resilience. And they can field larger militaries. Small states have risen to power on first-mover advantages, often with the acquiescence or benign neglect of larger states. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the United Kingdom was able to dominate the world with a first-mover advantage in industrialization. But that dominance was short-lived. Germany and the United States—thanks in part to the diffusion of British industrial methods—were able to achieve greater scale than a small island in the northwest corner of Europe. From 1870 to 1910, the British share of global manufacturing fell by half as the United States and Germany caught up and surpassed it. While the United Kingdom’s steel production doubled, to 6.5 million tons, Germany’s quintupled, to 12 million, and the United States’ grew sixfold, to 23 million. Germany and the United States pushed the British out of major industries, leveraging their larger internal markets, resource bases, and talent pools to drive down marginal costs. That economic advantage translated into still greater military and technological advantage. Together, these trends led to the United Kingdom’s gradual deindustrialization and eventual decline. British leaders and strategists were aware of the problem. In the late nineteenth century, the British historian John Robert Seeley, in one of the most influential books of the era, worried about the emergence of “highly organized states on a yet larger scale,” noting that as technology diffused, “Russia and the United States will surpass in power the states now called great as much as the great country-states of the sixteenth century surpassed Florence.” Even before the collapse of the British Empire, he feared that the United Kingdom would be reduced “to the level of a purely European Power” such as Spain. Seeley was not alone in calling for his country to pursue the kind of scale and efficiency gains an island could not generate on its own, through “Greater Britain”—tighter integration with imperial holdings in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. But these efforts were delayed, inconsistently pursued, and ultimately a failure. The colonies went their own way, and the British never found scale. When World War I broke out, London was fortunate to have a much more powerful ally in Washington—one with the scale to help win the war. That scale was clear to rivals. Before World War II, Hitler observed that “The American Union . . . has created a power factor of such dimensions that it threatens to overthrow all previous state power rankings.” Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto predicted that his country’s forces would “run wild for the first six months or a year, but I have utterly no confidence for the second and third years” because of the United States’ manufacturing advantage. Italy’s foreign minister also recognized that a protracted war favored the United States: “Who will have the most stamina? This is the way the question should be put.” All the Axis powers feared U.S. industrial capacity. They understood that quantity was a quality of its own. Today, that daunting scale and capacity belongs to China. American strategists must confront the risk that the United States could find itself in the position of the United Kingdom a century ago. The British experience offers both lessons and warnings: its effort at imperial integration was too little and too late. But the United States today can succeed where Britain failed, by harnessing allied and partner scale in new ways. The starting point for that success must be accurate self-assessment. In recent years, the pages of Foreign Affairs have featured a slew of essays making the case that the United States has a clear and enduring advantage over China. Michael Beckley argues that “the Chinese economy is shrinking relative to that of the United States” and that “current trends are solidifying a unipolar world.” Stephen Brooks and Ben Vagle claim that “the United States still has a commanding and durable advantage” that would give it significant economic leverage in a conflict. Jude Blanchette and Ryan Hass conclude that “the United States still has a vital edge over China in terms of economic dynamism, global influence, and technological innovation.” Predicting the rise or fall of great powers is always a fraught exercise, given inadequate information, the risks of bias, the long shadow of current events, and the challenge of sorting out which metrics matter most and in what time frame. American strategists previously swung from one extreme to another in their estimation of Japan and the Soviet Union. That same weakness has characterized net assessment of China and the United States. There is no question that China faces significant problems: an aging society, towering debt, stagnating productivity, growing risks in its housing market, high youth unemployment, crackdowns on the private sector. But even grave macroeconomic challenges do not neatly translate to strategic disadvantage. Two facts can be true at the same time: that China is slowing economically and that it is becoming more formidable strategically. And Beijing might well address economic challenges with a return to sound decision-making in the years ahead. Emphasizing China’s weaknesses risks understating its scale and capacity on the metrics and time frame most relevant for great-power competition. For example, the idea that the United States’ economy will remain larger than China’s—contrary to most expectations just a few years ago—is frequently offered as evidence of commanding U.S. advantage. But as the economist Noah Smith argues in his analysis of these GDP comparisons, “Americans should take little comfort in the fact that their total GDP at market exchange rates is outpacing China’s.” As exchange rates shift, so do comparisons of relative size, so that a 15 percent depreciation of the renminbi—as has occurred since its peak three years ago—would make the Chinese economy seem 15 percent smaller even if its output stayed the same. Accounting for purchasing power and local prices using the World Bank’s methodology, although imperfect, reveals instead that China’s economy surpassed the U.S. economy about a decade ago and is 25 percent larger today: roughly $30 trillion to the United States’ $24 trillion. This purchasing power adjustment captures the real cost of the determinants of national power, including infrastructure investment, weapons systems, manufactured goods, and government personnel—key factors in sustaining long-term strategic advantage. Using this approach, if one looks narrowly at goods rather than services, China’s productive capacity is three times as large as that of the United States—a decisive advantage in military and technological competition—and exceeds that of the next nine countries combined. In the two decades after China joined the World Trade Organization, its share of global manufacturing quintupled to 30 percent while the U.S. share halved to roughly 15 percent; the United Nations has estimated that, by 2030, the imbalance will grow to 45 percent and 11 percent. China leads in many traditional industries—producing 20 times as much cement, 13 times as much steel, three times as many cars, and twice as much power as the United States—and increasingly in advanced sectors as well. Although still catching up in fields such as biotechnology and aviation, which have been traditional U.S. strengths, China—thanks in part to ambitious industrial policy efforts such as Made in China 2025—produced almost half the world’s chemicals, half the world’s ships, more than two-thirds of electric vehicles, more than three-quarters of electric batteries, 80 percent of consumer drones, and 90 percent of solar panels and critical refined rare-earth minerals. And Beijing is taking steps to ensure its dominance continues and expands: China was responsible for half of all industrial robot installations worldwide (seven times as many as the United States), and it is a decade ahead of anyone else in commercializing fourth-generation nuclear technology, with plans to build over 100 reactors in 20 years. The last great power to so thoroughly dominate global production was the United States, from the 1870s to the 1940s. American observers tend to underestimate China’s ability to innovate, mistakenly assuming it simply copies and reproduces Western innovations. Like the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and the United States before it, China’s manufacturing strength creates a foundation for innovative advantage. State investment helps, too; it now rivals the United States’ investment in science. And China’s large population provides a deep talent pool and competitive scale. In ten industries of the future, according to a recent report from the Information Technology and Industry Foundation, China is near the leading edge of innovation (or better) in six. This industrial and innovative strength can be activated for military purposes. China’s navy, already the largest in the world, will add a staggering 65 vessels in just five years, reaching a total size 50 percent larger than the U.S. Navy—roughly 435 vessels to 300. It has rapidly increased its ships’ firepower, surging from one-tenth of the United States’ vertical launch system cells a decade ago to likely exceeding U.S. capacity by 2027. Although China lags the United States in aviation, it has broken a long-standing technical barrier by building jet engines at home and is now rapidly closing the production gap, with the ability to build more than 100 fourth-generation combat aircraft annually. In most missile technologies, China is probably the world’s leader: it boasts the first antiship ballistic missile, impressive air-to-air missile range, and the largest stockpile of conventional cruise and ballistic missiles. And in a growing number of military fields, from quantum communications to hypersonics, China is ahead of any competitor. These advantages, built over decades, will persist even if China stagnates. China’s challenges are significant. But their strategic importance is often overstated. For example, its demographic challenges will be a major issue in the long term, but in the medium term—a timeline much more relevant to competition with the United States—they are manageable. A generational “echo boom,” as the grandchildren of the Mao-era baby boomer generation enter the workforce, means that, despite an aging population, the percentage of the population below the age of 15 has actually increased, by over 30 million between the 2010 and 2020 censuses, and it has also grown as a percentage of the total population. China’s dependency ratio (of adult workers to children and retirees) will remain below Japan’s current ratio until 2050. And massive investments in education, industrial robotics, and embodied artificial intelligence will help China weather labor shortfalls. Debt levels are also illustrative. Although China’s household, corporate, and government debt is at a record 300 percent of GDP, other powers—including India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States—have similar levels of total debt. In some cases, metrics that indicate weakness in one area reflect strategic strengths in another. China’s housing bust, for example, is a drag on growth. But Beijing is plowing credit from that sector into industrial policy efforts that are boosting competitiveness. Similarly, while American firms continue to capture a higher share of profits and dominate rankings of market capitalization, Chinese firms are focused on different goals, often running losses to gain market share and put rivals out of business. Despite short-term challenges, China continues to play the long game. Even if its weaknesses prove more severe than projected, China will remain vastly more powerful than any past U.S. competitor on the metrics most relevant for competition. Washington may have overestimated past rivals, including Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union. But China is the first to outmatch the United States in size alone, as well as in several strategically relevant areas. Stagnant or not, Beijing will remain more formidable than any past challenger. Some analysts warn that American declinism is itself a risk, which could become “a self-fulfilling prophecy.” There is wisdom in that admonition; the rise and fall of great powers often begins with flawed self-diagnosis. But it is also the case, as the political scientist Samuel Huntington argued in these pages before the fall of the Soviet Union, that fretting about decline can just as often drive renewal. The greatest risk is not declinism; it is complacency, leading to a lack of strategic intention and a failure to catalyze collective action to rise to the China challenge. If anything, the United States—particularly in the era of President Donald Trump—risks overestimating unilateral power and underestimating China’s ability to counter it. For Washington, three realities must be central to any serious strategy for long-term competition. First, scale is essential. Second, China’s scale is unlike anything the United States has ever faced, and Beijing’s challenges will not fundamentally change that on any relevant timeline. And third, a new approach to alliances is the only viable way the United States can build sufficient scale of its own. Altogether, this means that Washington needs its allies and partners in ways that it did not in the past. They are not tripwires, distant protectorates, vassals, or markers of status, but providers of capacity needed to achieve great-power scale. For the first time since the end of World War II, the United States’ alliances are not about projecting power, but about preserving it. During the Cold War, the United States and its allies outclassed the Soviet Union. Today, a slightly expanded configuration would handily outclass China. Together, Australia, Canada, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the United States, and the European Union have a combined economy of $60 trillion to China’s $18 trillion, an amount more than three times as large as China’s at market exchange rates and still more than twice as large adjusting for purchasing power. It would account for roughly half of all global manufacturing (to China’s roughly one-third) and for far more active patents and top-cited journal articles than China does. It would account for $1.5 trillion in annual defense spending, roughly twice China’s. And it would displace China as the top trading partner of almost all states. (China is today the top trading partner of 120 states.) In raw terms, this alignment of democracies and market economies outscales China across nearly every dimension. Yet unless its power is coordinated, its advantages will remain largely theoretical. Accordingly, unlocking the potential of this coalition should be the central task of American statecraft in this century. And that cannot be done by simply doubling down on the traditional alliance playbook. The starting point for the United States can be long-standing bilateral alliances (such as those with Japan and South Korea) and multilateral alliances (such as NATO), along with newer partnerships (such as the AUKUS defense technology agreement with Australia and the United Kingdom) and less institutionalized groupings (such as the Quad, which also includes Australia, India, and Japan). But rather than simply celebrating these frameworks or expanding their membership, the task ahead is to deepen their function—to make them foundations for capacity-centric statecraft across multiple domains. These relationships have too often operated on the assumption that the United States provides security while others contribute political support or, at best, niche capabilities. It has been largely security-centric, too—focused on deterrence, access, and reassurance—while leaving economic coordination, industrial integration, and technological collaboration as emerging but still secondary concerns. The traditional model was simply not designed to compete with a systemic rival on the order of China. It is dangerously inadequate to the demands of the moment. The U.S. approach to alliances and partnerships in recent decades has been shaped by a combination of strategic habit and structural hierarchy. Now, it must become a platform for generating shared capacity across all critical domains—not just military ones. That will require a level of coordination and codependence that is unfamiliar and will at times be uncomfortable for both the United States and its partners. For military power, creating scale requires capacity to flow in both directions, including investment in the weaker parts of the U.S. defense industry and more generous provision of advanced U.S. military technologies to allies who historically have not received it. For the economy, scale means building a shared tariff and regulatory wall against China’s excess capacity while constructing new mechanisms to coordinate industrial policy and pool allied market share. For technology, the challenge will similarly be to erect common investment rules, export controls, and research protections to prevent technology transfer to China while undertaking joint investment. These steps mark the difference between a coalition that is aligned in principle and one that is fused in practice. That shift—toward shared capacity as the foundation of strategy—will allow the United States and its partners to compete at scale and at speed. The Biden administration used existing security alliances and partnerships to construct a “latticework” meant to better distribute force posture, increase allied defense spending, and launch new security arrangements such as AUKUS while elevating bodies such as the Quad. These efforts should be reinforced, but the next step is to transform defense-industrial cooperation. The lessons from Ukraine are clear: the United States would lack sufficient capacity to sustain a prolonged conflict with China on its own. Although innovation from new firms in uncrewed systems is promising, true scale, particularly in legacy systems, will require co-production and deeper industrial integration with allies. The World War II Arsenal of Democracy is unlikely to return. In its place, the United States needs to construct what the historian Arthur Herman has called an Arsenal of Democracies:  a networked defense industrial base built on joint production, shared innovation, and integrated supply chains. This marks a sharp change from the past, when the United States primarily provided capability to others. Now, scale demands two-way flows, including allied investment and manufacturing in the United States. Some initial steps the Biden administration took, such as having the Japanese repair American destroyers, provide a modest glimpse of what is possible. More ambitious efforts might involve joint ventures with Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders (which are two to three times more productive than U.S. firms); partnerships between Europe’s missile manufacturers and U.S. companies; or recruiting Japanese or Taiwanese firms to build legacy microelectronics in the United States. Too often, dated regulatory and political constraints, which must be addressed jointly by Congress and the executive, create barriers to benefiting from allied capability. The United States’ own capability must also flow outward to allies. Biden-era efforts such as AUKUS and the co-production of Tomahawk missiles with Japan are steps in the right direction. But real progress requires overcoming a bureaucratic alliance between a State Department concerned about proliferation and a Defense Department fearful of eroding its edge. Sharing technology quickly is the key to ensuring that Australia builds nuclear submarines, that Asian allies have sufficient antiship cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, that Taiwan can deter Chinese invasion, and that India is able to turn the Andaman Islands to its east into a fortress that Beijing cannot ignore. In practice, this could mean harmonizing export-control laws, aligning procurement standards, and coordinating investment in chokepoint components, from semiconductors to optical equipment. Allies can also transfer capacity to each other, both within regions and between different ones. Some of this has begun to happen haltingly, but much more is possible. South Korean weapons can help Europe rearm and reindustrialize. French nuclear technology can support India’s submarine program. Norwegian and Swedish missiles can help Indonesia and Thailand defend their waters. Pooling capacity requires thinking across alliances, with the United States facilitating collective action. Tighter integration also requires more burden sharing—and burden shifting. Even as allies and partners build bridges across continents, they must also play a bigger role in deterrence closer to home, with Europeans stepping up in Europe and Asians stepping up in Asia. That can be done in part by strengthening the security dimension of increasingly important groupings (the Quad or the trilateral relationship with Japan and Korea). But Washington also needs to strengthen coordination with allies for actual warfighting—through steps such as modernized joint command-and-control systems, new investments in interoperability, and more sophisticated joint exercises. That could include creating joint units with U.S. allies and partners, starting with ground-based antiaircraft and antiship missile battalions to be used in a crisis in the Indo-Pacific and later extending to more complex air and naval air formations. The United States should also reinforce extended deterrence by offering allies a greater say in nuclear command and control and the kinds of nuclear sharing arrangements that it pursued with European allies during the Cold War. Globally, the United States could pursue a new version of U.S. President Richard Nixon’s “Guam Doctrine,” which devolved responsibilities to partners after the Vietnam War. That would empower regional states—what former Australian Prime Minister John Howard called “deputy sheriffs”—to take the lead on security challenges in their neighborhood: Australia in the Pacific islands, India in South Asia, Vietnam in continental Southeast Asia, Nigeria in Africa. In practical terms, the next time a South Asian country faces challenges, the United States would defer to India’s judgment on what might serve regional stability or counter China’s influence rather than seek to advance its own preferences. The Biden administration took important steps in the economic and technology competition with China, with initiatives such as the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, and coordinated semiconductor export controls with Japan and the Netherlands. But withstanding China’s excess capacity and retaining technological leadership will require more ambitious action, beyond what Washington has typically been willing to do. China’s nonmarket practices and sheer scale have overwhelmed the World Trade Organization and now pose an existential risk to the industrial base of the United States and its allies and partners. Attempting to act alone against this threat will mean failure: securing the U.S. market will do little good if China can still push U.S. companies out of partner markets, depriving them of the scale they need to remain competitive. Instead, the United States and its allies and partners must find scale together, through a defensive moat against Chinese exports. Building a protected common market could start with coordinated tariffs on Chinese goods. But because tariffs can be easy to circumvent, a better approach might be to use coordinated nontariff barriers, including regulatory tools. (The Biden administration used such barriers against digitally connected vehicles from China.) Such regulatory measures could be coordinated with partners relatively quickly and easily. Another tool is “preferential plurilateralism”—selectively opening allied and partner markets while creating higher barriers for Chinese goods. This approach, broadly supported by figures across the political spectrum, from Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative during Trump’s first term, to prominent Democratic legislators, echoes aspects of the early post–World War II trading system, which gave preferential treatment to members of the free world over autocratic rivals. If the era of free trade agreements is over for now, then sectoral agreements with allies could offer promising avenues for pooling markets while avoiding political sensitivities. Coordinated industrial policy instruments would also be useful, such as a new international industrial investment bank that would make loans to firms in strategic sectors to diversify supply chains out of China, especially in key sectors such as medicine and critical minerals. And coordinated efforts to remove barriers to allied and partner investment could, for example, allow the bypass of national security review. Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have invested heavily in industrial cooperation with the United States (over $300 billion during the Biden administration with continued growth under Trump). And despite a tendency to dismiss Europe as economically stagnant, it outproduces the United States in steel, cars, ships, and civil aircraft; claims a greater share of global manufacturing; and has a manufacturing workforce three times the size of that of the United States. Meanwhile, stronger connections between scientific ecosystems—with more cooperation and people-to-people ties, along with common research protections—will help ensure that U.S. allies and partners can match China’s scale. Pooled market share would also create strategic leverage. A collective framework for economic defense—what some have called an “economic Article 5,” drawing on NATO’s mutual defense clause—is a long-overdue response to China’s economic coercion. Such an agreement would trigger coordinated sanctions, export controls, or trade action if one of the group’s members encountered economic pressure from Beijing.",Underestimating China,Kurt M.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7l123zy5o,"An Israeli air strike has destroyed part of al Ahli Arab Hospital, the last fully functional hospital in Gaza City. Witnesses said the strike destroyed the intensive care and surgery departments of the hospital. Video posted online appeared to show huge flames and smoke rising after missiles hit a two-storey building. People, including some patients still in hospital beds, were filmed rushing away from the site. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted the hospital because it contained a ""command and control centre used by Hamas"". No casualties were reported, according to Gaza's civil emergency service. However, one child, who previously suffered a head injury, died as a result of ""the rushed evacuation process"", according to a statement from the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, part of the Anglican Church, which runs the hospital. Surrounding buildings, including St Philip's church, were also damaged, the diocese said. It added that it was ""appalled"" at the bombing of the hospital ""on the morning of Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week"". Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said al Ahli Arab Hospital's building was ""completely destroyed"", leading to the ""forced displacement of patients and hospital staff"". The IDF said it had taken steps ""to mitigate harm to civilians or to the hospital compound, including issuing advanced warnings in the area of the terror infrastructure, the use of precise munitions, and aerial surveillance"". A local journalist, who was working at the hospital, said the IDF had phoned a doctor who was operating in the emergency department and asked them to evacuate the hospital immediately. ""All patients and displaced people must go out to a safe distance,"" the officer reportedly said. ""You have only 20 minutes to leave."" Footage on social media showed staff and patients leaving the building while it was still dark outside. Dozens of Palestinians, including women and children, were also seen fleeing from a courtyard inside the hospital where they had been seeking shelter. Khalil Bakr told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme that he and his three injured daughters had fled the hospital with only a couple of minutes to spare before it was bombed. ""It was terrifying,"" he said. ""The whole situation was difficult because I have already been injured. And as for my three daughters, one had her leg amputated, the other had her hand amputated, and the third had her body full of platinum plates."" He added: ""Only two minutes separated us from death."" Al Ahli Arab - a small medical facility before the war - was the only fully functional hospital in Gaza City, following the destruction ofAl-Shifa medical complexand other hospitals in the northern part of the Strip. World Health Organization director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the hospital was out of service following the evacuation order and attack, according to an update he received from the hospital's director. Dr Ghebreyesus highlighted how a child had died after a disruption to care, and said the hospital had been forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals, but was unable to move 40 critical patients and could not receive new patients until repairs are carried out. ""Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop,"" he stated. In its statement, the Hamas-run government media office condemned the attack. Israel was ""committing a horrific crime by targeting al Ahli Arab, which houses hundreds of patients and medical staff"", it said. UK Foreign Minister David Lammy said such ""deplorable attacks must end"", adding: ""Israel's attacks on medical facilities have comprehensively degraded access to healthcare in Gaza."" The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said in a statement: ""For the only Christian hospital in Gaza to be attacked on Palm Sunday is especially appalling. ""I share in the grief of our Palestinian brothers and sisters in the Diocese of Jerusalem. I pray for the staff and patients of the hospital, and for the family of the boy who tragically died during the evacuation."" In October 2023, an explosion at the same hospitalkilled hundreds of people. Palestinian officials blamed an Israeli strike for the blast. Israel said the blast was caused by a failed rocket launch by the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which denied responsibility. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 50,933 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Of those, 1,563 have been killed since 18 March, when Israel restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip, the ministry said. Assad al-Nassasra was missing for weeks following last month's attack, in which 15 emergency workers were killed by Israeli troops. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar accused each other of lies or inaccuracies in sworn depositions. Dozens of countries will give evidence at the ICJ hearings, which Israel has labelled a ""circus"". But the Qatari PM says there was still no ""answer for the ultimate question: how to end this war"".

https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-fm-ukrainian-membership-in-nato-should-not-be-off-the-agenda/,"Ukraine’s NATO membership must remain on the international agenda, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum on April 12, stressing that Kyiv’s integration is essential for long-term transatlantic security. “This is not just about Ukraine,” Sybiha said. “This is about transatlantic security. It’s about our contribution.” He emphasized that Ukraine currently fields 110 combat-ready brigades, describing them as a “realistic, true contribution to future security — and, by the way, the cheapest one.” Sybiha also criticized Russia for violating all 10 principles of the Helsinki Final Act and highlighted the problems within the UN. “This year, we mark 80 years of the UN Charter. Why do I mention this? Because it is important that international law should be law, not simply declarations or words,” he said. He added that the global system had proven “dysfunctional” and “unjust” in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “We need new enforcement tools. We need reforms. We need reforms in the UN and, by the way, in humanitarian law — in the Geneva Conventions. We must update them, not only for Ukraine but for other countries like Syria. Having such a bitter experience, we are ready to contribute.” Addressing the ongoing war, Sybiha reaffirmed Ukraine’s desire for peace but warned against the misuse of the term. “We want to end this war this year. But it is important not to manipulate,” he said. “How this war ends will determine the future security architecture of Europe — it depends on the future security of every family in Europe,” he said. “That is why achieving a long-term and clear peace is fundamentally important.” Sybiha also condemned Russia for escalating attacks on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s commitment to a full ceasefire. “Yesterday marked exactly one month since Ukraine unconditionally supported a full ceasefire,” he said. “Instead of this, Russia has only escalated its terror,” 	Sybiha said According to the foreign minister, Russian forces have launched nearly 70 missiles, more than 2,020 Shahed drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs over the past month — most of them targeting civilian areas. “This clearly shows the world who truly wants peace and who is committed to war,” he said.",Ukrainian FM: Kyiv's membership in NATO should not be off the table,Anna Fratsyvir,The Kyiv Independent,2025-04-12T09:30:46.000,2025-04-12T09:44:06.000,gemini-2.0-flash
https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-works-to-repair-chornobyl-containment-structure-damaged-in-russian-drone-strike/,"Ukraine is working to repair damage to the containment structure at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant following a Russian drone strike in February, Environment Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said on April 12. Speaking at the site of the decommissioned plant, Hrynchuk noted that the strike had compromised the functionality of the massive protective arch installed in 2019 to prevent radioactive leaks. The minister commented during the launch of a new 0.8-megawatt solar power station near Chornobyl ahead of two upcoming nuclear safety and energy conferences. She said that Ukraine is cooperating with international experts to assess the extent of the damage and determine the necessary steps to restore the arch's integrity. ""Unfortunately, after the attack, the arch partially lost its functionality. And now, I think, already in May, we will have the results of the analysis that we are currently conducting ...,"" Hrynchuk said. ""We are actively working on this ... We, of course, need to restore the ""arch"" so that there are no leaks under any circumstances because ensuring nuclear and radiation safety is the main task."" She added that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as well as scientific institutions and companies involved in the arch’s original installation, are contributing to the analysis. According to plant officials, the February 14 drone attack created a hole in the containment vessel’s outer layer and exploded inside. The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the incident as ""a provocation."" The structure was designed to enclose the unstable sarcophagus hastily built after the 1986 reactor explosion—the worst nuclear accident in history. Hrynchuk also emphasized the importance of renewable energy in the Chornobyl exclusion zone, saying the new solar facility would support the site's power needs. ""We have been saying for many years that the exclusion zone needs to be transformed into a zone of renewal,"" she said. ""And this territory, like no other in Ukraine, is suitable for developing renewable energy projects.""",Ukraine works to repair Chornobyl containment structure damaged in Russian drone strike,Olena Goncharova,The Kyiv Independent,2025-04-12T19:38:00,2025-04-12T20:45:23,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-claims-it-handed-over-most-sites-in-southern-lebanon-to-nations-army/,"BEIRUT — Most military sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon have been placed under Lebanese army control, a source close to the terror group said Saturday. A November 27 ceasefire that ended more than a year of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, including two months of full-blown war, stipulated that only United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanon’s army should be deployed in the country’s south. The deal required the Iran-backed terror group to dismantle its remaining military infrastructure in the south and move its fighters north of the Litani River, which is about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Israeli border. “Out of 265 Hezbollah military positions identified south of the Litani, the movement has ceded about 190 to the army,” the source said on condition of anonymity. The stipulation was also part of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, but Hezbollah never adhered to the obligation and continued to build up its forces and positions to an unprecedented degree in recent years. On October 8, 2023, Hezbollah began launching near-daily rocket and drone attacks on northern Israel in support of the Hamas terror group, a day after its massive, deadly assault on southern Israel. The attacks forced the evacuation of 60,000 northern residents, killed dozens of people and caused significant damage. Israel hit back with airstrikes, and by September 2024, the conflict escalated into open war, during which Israel decimated Hezbollah’s leadership and stockpiles. The war ended in a late November 2024 ceasefire, which has largely held despite mutual accusations of violations. Under the agreement, Israeli forces were to withdraw from southern Lebanon while Hezbollah was to remove its military infrastructure from the area. Troops remain in five points deemed “strategic” by the Israeli military. Israel also maintains the right to strike targets that pose an imminent threat. In recent days, some Hezbollah officials have signaled a willingness to discuss the group’s arsenal with the country’s government. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, a US-backed former army chief whose election in January ended a two-year impasse, has vowed to seek a state monopoly on arms. The United States deputy special envoy for the Middle East, Morgan Ortagus, discussed disarming Hezbollah with senior Lebanese figures during her visit to the country a week ago, a Lebanese official said. In an interview with Lebanese television channel LBCI, Ortagus said, “We continue to press on this government to fully fulfill the cessation of hostilities, and that includes disarming Hezbollah and all militias.” She said it should happen “as soon as possible.” The United States chairs a committee, which also includes France, tasked with overseeing the ceasefire.",Hezbollah claims it has handed over most sites in southern Lebanon to nation’s army,"AFP, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-04-12T12:57:21,2025-04-12T12:57:21,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.thetimes.com/uk/defence/article/russia-secret-war-uk-waters-submarines-dpbzphfx5,"Russian sensors suspected of attempting to spy on the UK’s nuclear submarines have been found hidden in the seas around Britain. The discovery by the British military was deemed a potential threat to national security and has never been made public. Several were found after they washed ashore, while others are understood to have been located by the Royal Navy. The devices are believed to have been planted by Moscow to try and gather intelligence on Britain’s four Vanguard submarines, which carry nuclear missiles. One of these submarines is always at sea under what is known as the UK’s continuous at-sea deterrent. The Sunday Times has chosen to withhold certain details, including the locations of the sensors. During a three-month investigation we spoke to more than a dozen former defence ministers, senior armed forces personnel and military experts to expose how Russia is using its unrivalled underwater warfare capabilities to map, hack and potentially sabotage critical British infrastructure. We were allowed unprecedented access to the RFA Proteus, the Royal Navy’s deep-sea surveillance vessel, to witness how it is leading efforts to counter threats in domestic waters. The investigation also found: Unmanned Russian vehicles have been discovered lurking next to deep-sea communications cables. The Ministry of Defence had credible intelligence that superyachts owned by Russian oligarchs may have been used to conduct underwater reconnaissance. The navy has discovered other sensors planted on the sea bed. The government is looking at requiring technology and energy companies to work more closely with the military and fund the protection of underwater infrastructure. Senior military figures liken the technological battle for supremacy below the waves to the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Now Britain has “woken up” to the Russian threat, the question is whether it is capable of catching up. First line of defence At 8.45am on March 21, a black inflatable speedboat is skimming across Campbeltown Loch towards one of the most secretive vessels in the Royal Navy’s fleet. The Sunday Times has joined senior naval officers being ferried to the RFA Proteus, named after the sea god in Greek mythology, as its crew spend the week training and experimenting with cutting-edge underwater vehicles. Anchored just off Scotland’s westernmost town, the Proteus forms an imposing silhouette against the Isle of Arran, its giant helipad and deep-sea crane clearly visible from a mile away. It is the first time a journalist has been allowed to observe its capabilities since the vessel came into service in 2023. On deck, helmeted crews prepare remotely operated vehicles that later today will be lowered to the sea bed via a moon pool — an opening in the hull the size of eight snooker tables. Other, more sensitive equipment is stowed in blue metal containers. Already aboard are two dozen members of the navy’s diving and mine-hunting squadrons, experts in searching out, recovering and destroying enemy munitions on the sea bed. They are here for the first time and will become an integral part of the ship’s operations, because Britain’s critical undersea infrastructure is under unprecedented threat from a long-standing nemesis: Russia. Cat and mouse When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the might of Russia’s non-nuclear forces went with it. But according to Royal Navy insiders, Moscow never stopped investing in the submarines patrolling the murky depths of the world’s oceans. Russia is the only nation with a fleet of specialist subs for sea-bed warfare and espionage. Some surpass the capabilities of those of Britain and its Nato allies. By the time President Putin sent tanks into Ukraine three years ago, Russia had already begun setting the stage for a much wider conflict with Nato, engaging in surveillance and sabotage of the underwater internet connections, energy pipelines and military cables that are vital to the functioning of western democracies. These activities are at the heart of Putin’s “greyzone” doctrine. The blowing up of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in 2022 was the first major incident; Royal Navy insiders maintain that its “military precision” had all the hallmarks of a Kremlin greyzone operation. In the past 15 months, at least 11 internet cables in the Baltic Sea have also been damaged, some from ships dragging anchor across the sea bed. Suspicion has come to rest on Russia’s shadow fleet of ageing tankers, which are mainly used by Putin to circumvent western oil sanctions. “You really need to keep the [engine] power on to drag, so it is a deliberate act,” a defence insider said. When a cable between Estonia and Finland was damaged in December, the Joint Expeditionary Force, a group of northern European and Baltic states led by the UK, responded by activating Nordic Warden, a reaction system that uses AI to track locations of the shadow fleet. A senior serving British military figure added: “There should be no doubt, there is a war raging in the Atlantic. This is a game of cat and mouse that has continued since the ending of the Cold War, and is now heating up again. We are seeing phenomenal amounts of Russian activity.” The Russian underwater research programme is largely overseen by the Main Directorate for Deep-Sea Research (Gugi). Its best-known vessel is the spy ship Yantar, which gained notoriety last year when it appeared off the British coast. It is equipped with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and two mini-submarines capable of reaching depths of 6,000m, craft that allow the Yantar to find and map infrastructure, as well as to cut cables using manipulator arms or tap them for information. In November, the Yantar was found in the Irish Sea loitering near cables carrying data for Microsoft and Google. The Proteus was one of several vessels dispatched to monitor it – or, as a defence source describes, it show Russia “they were pissing in our backyard.” When the Yantar returned to the English Channel in January, the defence secretary John Healey authorised HMS Somerset and HMS Tyne tracked it at closer range, while HMS Astute, a nuclear-powered submarine, covertly monitored the vessel from below before surfacing alongside it. This more aggressive posture has been widely welcomed in the navy, with a senior official stating: “We’ve got to play by the rules of the game. But whereas before we were playing it nicely, now we’re being more muscular.” However, the Yantar is not where the real problem lies. The waters immediately encircling Britain sit for the most part on the European continental shelf, meaning they are seldom deeper than 300m. The navy has several ways of monitoring them and is confident it can keep tabs on Russian activity. But where the continental shelf ends, the sea bed drops thousands of metres. The Proteus is the only navy surface vessel truly capable of policing these depths, where Gugi’s most potent threat, its fleet of six-nuclear powered mini-submarines, could be lurking. The mini-subs can sit on the sea bed and have manipulator arms capable of cutting cables, laying explosives or placing taps on fibreoptic cables for hacking purposes. They are supported by two larger “mother” submarines, meaning they can be moved covertly to pretty much anywhere in the world. Russia has other capabilities. Three senior defence sources have revealed that prior to the full invasion of Ukraine, there was credible intelligence that superyachts owned by oligarchs may have been used to conduct underwater reconnaissance around Britain. Several of these vessels have moon pools that can be used covertly to deploy and retrieve deep-sea reconnaissance and diving equipment. A former minister also recounted how, in 2018, HMS Albion, an amphibious assault ship, had been forced to leave port prematurely while moored in Limassol, Cyprus. The vessel had been docked for under 24 hours when a huge superyacht belonging to an oligarch pulled up alongside it. Suspecting that it was there covertly to surveil the Albion, the navy ship “moved on quite quickly.” Sea-bed warfare The Nord Stream attack highlighted the fragility of the UK’s energy supply, almost a fifth of which now comes from offshore wind farms. The electricity generated by these turbines is transported to the mainland through undersea cables. Oil and gas pipelines are also vital to Britain, particularly those ferrying gas from Norway. They could easily be severed were Russia to plant explosive devices, such as shaped charges or mines. “You cut those and you’ve lost that energy — and in the winter during high usage, that could be serious,” a senior military figure said. A second added that a co-ordinated attack could lead to a “failure of the national grid”. The 60 internet cables that connect Britain to the rest of the world are coated in plastic polyethylene and only a few inches thick. They are easily cut and most of their locations are recorded publicly. However, navy sources said the private companies operating them have laid so many that there is enough “redundancy” in the system to recover quickly from all but the most severe attacks. The ones that trouble the UK government most are used to transfer banking data across the Atlantic and are integral to the functioning of western financial markets. Satellite back-ups would not be able to handle the huge volume of information that flows through them every second of every day. The government started to worry about these vulnerabilities a decade ago, when George Osborne’s Treasury received a research paper from a young financier called Rishi Sunak, who had recently joined the Policy Exchange think tank. Secretive work was commissioned on how these cables could be better protected, but the answers were deemed to be in the “too-difficult category”, according to sources. Sunak’s paper would not be published until 2017, several years later. What troubles the military more profoundly is the ability of Russia to map, tap into or destroy military cables vital to its operations around the world. “There are cables that are not public,” said one senior source. “The Russians have the capability to cut military cables.” Before the visit to the Proteus, two senior UK sources told The Sunday Times that in around 2020, Russian UUVs — remotely operated and capable of operating at deep depths and travelling for hundreds of miles for days at a time — were found next to sensitive underwater cables. There was no mothership or submarine near by, suggesting they had travelled a great distance to reach the cables. The Ministry of Defence deemed it “beyond reasonable doubt” that the UUVs were attempting to hack the cables, although no evidence to date suggests Russia has succeeded. However, it has uncovered proof of other Russian activity that is altogether more disturbing. Hiding in plain sight In recent years, the navy has found a number of sensor devices in the seas around Britain. The Ministry of Defence believes they were planted there by Moscow in order to detect the movements of Britain’s four Vanguard submarines, which together make up the UK’s constant at-sea nuclear deterrent. After leaving Faslane in Scotland, the submarines “vanish” and are supposed to be invisible from enemy states for the entirety of their deployment, which is typically 90 days or more. It is not clear what type of sensors were found. Several had washed up on the shore, but more have been identified using the Royal Navy’s fleet of mine-hunter vessels. As they searched, the navy found other sensors it did not know were there, The Ministry of Defence said the at-sea deterrent remains “undetected.” Whether the UK has discovered evidence of other Russian activity is top secret. “It’s a bit like the space race,” said one senior UK source. “This is a world clouded in secrecy and subterfuge, it’s very hard to get absolute clarity. But there’s enough smoke to suggest something is on fire somewhere.” Catching up In 2021, the Integrated Review — a master document outlining the UK’s national security and foreign policy aims after Brexit — committed to purchasing a surveillance ship to protect the UK’s critical underwater infrastructure and to allow the authorities to better understand the scale of the threat. Two years later, the MoD bought a Norwegian deep-water offshore support vessel, the Topaz Tangaroa, for £70 million. It was modified and renamed the Proteus before becoming operational in October 2023. The ship has a permanent crew of about 30 civilian sailors from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the merchant arm of the navy, but is ultimately run by specialist naval teams. Life on the Proteus is demanding and the ship is expected to be at sea 330 days a year. A week before The Sunday Times visit, members of the navy’s mine-hunting and threat-exploitation teams had embedded for the first time. Among them was X-Ray Squadron, which uses autonomous underwater vehicles for mine-hunting, as well as identifying and destroying threats. During our visit, the teams were training with one of their newest assets: the SeaCat, a cutting-edge 3m-long, torpedo-shaped autonomous vehicle. It has a high-resolution camera on its nose and advanced sonar systems on its sides like wings. It is capable of running for 24 hours at depths of 300m and one of the commanding officers says it is typically between “three and six times quicker” at hunting mines than conventional methods. Nearby, another team is preparing the Gavia, a UUV that can plunge 1,000m, deep enough to cover most of the waters surrounding the UK. Then there is the Defender, which can be fitted with an array of equipment, including manipulator arms. Porton Down, the military’s top-secret research facility, has been developing arms capable of handling and planting shaped charges, a precision explosive that can be used to disable enemy mines. This capability was tested recently off the coast of Norway, where the Proteus was sent to coincide with a visit by John Healey, the defence secretary, who is negotiating a deal with Oslo to work more closely together to counter the Russian threat. All three vehicles also have sophisticated sonar systems to scan large areas of sea bed. If they find suspicious activity, they can be sent closer to capture high-resolution images. Captain Simon Pressdee, one of the senior officers on the visit, said: “Our role is to both defeat any threats to the UK as well as take it out of the greyzone. We do the latter by understanding who is involved and providing that evidence to avoid misunderstandings and make those who threaten the UK accountable for their actions.” The Proteus has other assets that are able to delve to the deepest part of the ocean, although these were hidden away on the visit. Future-proofing With the government committed to spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence by 2027, further investment in sea-bed warfare is coming. The strategic defence review, commissioned by Healey to plug the gaps in Britain’s armed forces, is expected to recommend sharper focus on underwater infrastructure. Ministers have already accelerated the roll-out of the navy’s first autonomous mine-hunting vessel, the Ariadne and are rolling out a cutting-edge unmanned submarine under a programme called Project Cetus. The purchase of another Proteus-style ship is also being discussed. “Our adversary has multiple points of action that they can be playing, and we’ve only got one ship that can deal with it,” one insider said. As part of the review, the navy has proposed a new programme, Atlantic Bastion, which will develop a new fleet of air, surface and submersible vehicles, as well as sensors, to police British waters and the wider north Atlantic. In the shorter term, a project codenamed Cabot will get these capabilities up and running in partnership with private industries that rely on underwater infrastructure. This is likely to mean companies are asked to help fund operations, sources said. A similar idea has been pushed for years by Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the former Tory transport secretary and defence minister. “If this is a national endeavour, it is perhaps time to consider legislating for a level of assured protections of our energy, water, subsea cables … by asking everyone to chip in to the costs,” she said. “A hypothecated tax paid into a defence fund, which can provide protections and deterrence from those who wish our economic security and way of life harm, must be the way.” An MoD spokesman said: “We are committed to enhancing the security of critical offshore infrastructure. Alongside our NATO and Joint Expeditionary Force allies, we are strengthening our response to ensure that Russian ships and aircraft cannot operate in secrecy near the UK or near NATO territory, harnessing new technologies like AI and coordinating patrols with our allies. And our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent continues to patrol the world’s oceans undetected as it has done for 56 years.” Privately, some in the navy think the UK needs to go further and restore its capability to lay sea mines, something it has not done since the end of the Cold War. The last stockpiles were dispensed with in 1992, due to the ethical concerns of successive governments and the belief they were redundant. However, Australia has recently pledged £500 million for sea mines, and the Russian threat has reopened the question in the minds of some personnel. Poland and the Baltic states recently announced plans to withdraw from a treaty banning anti-personnel mines. The navy is not considering this at present and no proposal has been put forward as part of the strategic defence review. But one official, speaking anonymously, said the UK may well need to be able to lay defensive fields around British waters to keep out enemy submarines. Sir Keir Starmer’s government has clearly realised the scale of the threat, with billions of pounds of extra defence spending putting Britain closer to a war footing. Given what is happening beneath the waves, that investment is needed now more than ever.",Revealed: Russia’s secret war in UK waters,Harry Yorke,The Sunday Times,2025-04-05T17:00:23,2025-04-07T06:14:49,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yl2729nmjo,"Russia's ambassador to the UK has not denied allegations that Russian sensors have been hidden in seas around Great Britain in an attempt to track UK nuclear submarines. Andrei Kelin said that while he did not deny Russia was attempting to track British submarines, he rejected the idea that such activities presented a threat to the UK. Asked on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg whether he objected to the claims, Kelin said: ""No"". ""I am not going to deny it, but I wonder whether we really have an interest in following all the British submarine with very old outdated nuclear warheads... all these threats are extremely exaggerated,"" he said. Pressed further by Kuenssberg, the ambassador added: ""I'm denying existence of threats for the United Kingdom. This threat has been invented, absolutely, there is no threat at all from Russia to the UK."" Kelin's admission follows an investigation published by the Sunday Times earlier this month, detailing the discovery of alleged Russian sensors in seas around Britain. In its investigation, the Sunday Times said the devices are believed to have been planted by Moscow to try to gather intelligence on the UK's four Vanguard submarines, which carry nuclear missiles. The British military discovered the existence of the devices and deemed them a potential threat to national security, the paper reported. The devices have been characterised as being part of a hybrid - or ""grey zone"" - war being fought by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Other activities of such warfare could include doing damage to infrastructure assets, such as energy pipelines. Putin's secret weapon: The threat to the UK lurking on our sea beds The accusations come after the Royal Navy released images in March of a Russian warship that it tracked sailing near British waters. Named Boikiy, it is one of several Russian vessels to have been tracked sailing near the British coast in recent months. Defence Secretary John Healey told MPs in January that the Royal Navy had monitored a Russian spy ship after it was spotted around UK waters - accusing the vessel, called Yantar, of being used to gather intelligence and map the UK's underwater infrastructure. Former Conservative defence and Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood has warned that the UK is ""behind the curve"" in tracking Russia's deep-sea operations. Ellwood told the Guardian earlier this month the use of sensors was ""only half the story"", claiming that Russia has established ""remote seabed platforms"" off the UK coast that act as recharging stations for dozens of mini-submarines ""to map our undersea cable networks for potential sabotage"". A Ministry of Defence spokesperson told BBC News: ""We are committed to maintaining and enhancing the security and resilience of critical undersea infrastructure.  ""Just as the defence secretary called out the activities of the Russian spy ship Yantar hovering over our undersea cables, let those who threaten the UK or our allies be in no doubt that we will defend our undersea infrastructure."" Responding to the Sunday Times investigation into the sensors, an MoD spokesman said: ""Alongside our NATO and Joint Expeditionary Force allies, we are strengthening our response to ensure that Russian ships and aircraft cannot operate in secrecy near the UK or near NATO territory, harnessing new technologies like AI and coordinating patrols with our allies.  ""And our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent continues to patrol the world's oceans undetected as it has done for 56 years.""",Ambassador does not deny Russian attempts to track UK subs,Alys Davies,BBC News,2025-04-12T17:00:10,2025-04-12T17:00:10,gemini-2.0-flash
https://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-reports-highest-number-measles-cases-2019-cdc/story?id=120709527,"The U.S. has recorded the highest number of measles cases since 2019, according to new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data published Friday. There are now 712 confirmed measles cases across 24 states, an increase of 105 cases from the prior week, the CDC said. This is likely an undercount due to delays in states reporting cases to the federal health agency. In 2019, there was a total of 1,274 reported cases, CDC data shows. If the U.S. surpasses this figure, it would lead to the highest number of cases recorded since 1992. MORE: RFK Jr. claims curve is flattening in Texas measles outbreak. Does the data agree? Cases have been confirmed in 24 states including Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington. At least five states including Indiana, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas are reporting outbreaks, meaning three or more related cases. Reported Measles Cases in the U.S. As of April 10, 2025 CDC The CDC says 11% of measles patients in the U.S. this year have been hospitalized, the majority of whom are under age 19. Among the nationally confirmed cases by the CDC, about 97% are in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Of those cases, 1% are among those who have received just one dose of the MMR vaccine and 2% are among those who received the required two doses, according to the CDC. The CDC currently recommends that people receive two vaccine doses, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster. Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 due to the highly effective vaccination program, according to the CDC. However, CDC data shows vaccination rates have been lagging in recent years. The country could be at risk of losing its elimination status if an outbreak continued for more than one year. The outbreak in western Texas saw its first measles cases in January of this year MORE: RFK Jr. claims measles can be treated with vitamin A, linked to poor diet. Here's what science says As of Friday, 541 measles cases have been recorded, primarily in western Texas. This is an increase of 36 cases since the last update on Tuesday. Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated individuals or in individuals whose vaccination status is unknown, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). At least 56 people have been hospitalized. Four of the cases are among residents who have been vaccinated with one dose of the MMR vaccine. Seven cases are among those vaccinated with two doses. The majority of cases are among children and teenagers between ages 5 and 17 followed by children ages 4 and under, according to the data. There have been at least two confirmed deaths linked to the Texas outbreak, both of which occurred in unvaccinated school-aged children with no underlying conditions. A third death is being investigated in New Mexico in an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles after dying. During a press conference with reporters on Tuesday, Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas, which has had more than 30 cases, said she worries about the measles outbreak potentially spreading to more urban areas. I'm worried about exposures in grocery stores and malls and those places that don't exist in the more rural community, she said. 24 coverage of breaking news and live events",US reports highest number of measles cases since 2019: CDC,"Mary Kekatos, Sony Salzman",ABC News,2025-04-11T12:42:00,2025-04-12T09:44:37,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-chief-is-worried-about-russian-space-nukes/,"The development of nuclear weapons in space is a way for Russia to improve its capabilities, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte tells Welt am Sonntag. NATO is concerned that Russia is seeking to deploy nuclear weapons in space, a development that could threaten the thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth that are crucial to defense as well as people's daily lives, the alliance's chief said.

We are aware of reports that Russia is examining the possibility of placing nuclear weapons in space, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag in an interview published Saturday. Welt is a sister publication of POLITICO in the Axel Springer Group.

""The development of nuclear weapons in space is a way for Russia to improve its capabilities,"" Rutte said. ""This is very worrying,"" he stressed.

""Space is also very important for our deterrence and defense  just as important as land, sea, air and cyberspace,"" Rutte told the newspaper. ""In recent years, space has become increasingly crowded, dangerous and unpredictable. We know that competition in space is fierce,"" he said.

If Moscow were to deploy nuclear weapons in space, it could threaten hundreds of satellites, not just those being used by Kyiv and its allies to defend Ukraine against Russia's all-out invasion.

With about 7,000 satellites currently orbiting the planet, ""space-based systems directly affect our way of life,"" said Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister. ""They ensure, for example, that mobile phones, banking services and weather forecasts work.""

An international agreement preventing an arms race in outer space came into force in 1967, with 114 signing  including Russia. Still, it doesn't completely rule out military activities in space and, critics argue, might not adequately address the dangers that emanate from modern satellite systems.

""NATO allies are adapting to the challenges in space, including sharing intelligence and establishing national space command centers, but also developing smaller satellites that are more maneuverable and better protected,"" Rutte said.
