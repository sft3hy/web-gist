— The European Union’s top diplomat slammed U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration for sidelining Ukraine












and engaging with Russia’s Vladimir Putin without consulting Kyiv or Europe.



U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told allies in Brussels on Wednesday that Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO and reclaim its 1991 borders as part of a peace settlement were “unrealistic.” He also said the U.S. would “no longer tolerate” European NATO members relying on Washington for security.



The remarks, followed by a surprise phone call between Trump and Putin in which the two agreed to enter peace talks, have stunned European officials and raised concerns that Kyiv may be sidelined in discussions about its own future.



“They [the U.S.] say that it’s not going to be NATO membership, but some other security guarantees. Then the questions need to be answered by everybody — what are these security guarantees, really?” said Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, ahead of a NATO defense ministers’ meeting.



“Being in NATO, where we have these structures, is actually the best security guarantee,” she added.

















Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister known for her staunch support of Ukraine, condemned what she described as a reckless diplomatic maneuver that rewards Russian aggression before negotiations even begin.



“We shouldn’t take anything off the table before negotiations start. It plays into Russia’s hands. And it is exactly what they want,” she said. “Why are we giving them everything they want even before negotiations begin? Appeasement has never worked.”



German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius echoed her concerns, warning against making public concessions ahead of talks.



“In my view, it would have been better to discuss Ukraine’s possible NATO membership or the country’s possible loss of territory only at the negotiating table, not to rule it out beforehand,” Pistorius said in Brussels.



Kallas stressed that any peace deal imposed without the consent of Ukraine and European allies was doomed to fail.



“There’s an agreement being made behind our backs that simply will not work,” she said. “For any kind of agreement, you need Europeans to implement it, you need Ukrainians to implement it.”



“It doesn’t look good if somebody agrees on something and everybody else has to say, ‘OK, you have agreed, but we will not follow this.’ Ukrainians will resist, and we will support them,”





Kallas added.

















NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte took a more diplomatic tone, arguing that the statements from Trump and Hegseth merely underscored the need for dialogue within the alliance.



“Secretary Hegseth’s comments, and what later emerged from Washington, were significant statements,” Rutte said.



“At the same time, this is how an alliance should function,” he said. “We are a coalition of democracies. We need to debate. But I see a clear convergence: we all want peace, we want it to be lasting and we must ensure Ukraine is in the strongest possible position.”



At the same time, Rutte noted that Europe “must also step up defense spending and industrial production.”



“On that, there is clear agreement,” he said.",‘Why Are We Handing Russia What It Wants?’: EU’s Chief Diplomat Blasts U.S. Over Ukraine,Pyotr Kozlov,The Moscow Times,2025-02-13T08:29:51,2025-04-30T22:30:20,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vpqr6511yo,"Hamas has said it is committed to implementing the Gaza ceasefire deal with Israel and will continue releasing hostages as scheduled, raising hopes that a resumption of the war can be averted. Following talks in Cairo, the Palestinian armed group said mediators from Egypt and Qatar had confirmed they would ""remove obstacles"". Egyptian and Qatari reports also said gaps had been bridged. An Israeli government spokesman did not comment on the reports but stated that if Hamas did not free three living hostages on Saturday then the ceasefire would end. Israel's prime minister made a similar ultimatum on Tuesday after Hamas said it was postponing releases over what it claimed were Israeli violations. Hamas said these included a failure to allow in the agreed amounts of vital humanitarian aid, including tents and shelters, which Israel denied. The group's threat to derail the deal prompted US President Donald Trump to propose Israel cancel the agreement altogether and ""let hell break out"" unless ""all of the hostages"" were returned by Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he welcomed Trump's demand and warned: ""If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon [10:00 GMT], the ceasefire will end and the [Israeli military] will resume intense fighting until the final defeat of Hamas."" However, there were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether he was demanding the release of all 76 hostages still in Gaza - in line with Trump's ultimatum - or just the three due to be freed this weekend. On Wednesday, an Egyptian security source told the BBC that Egypt and Qatar were ""intensifying their diplomatic efforts in an attempt to salvage the ceasefire agreement"", as Hamas's leader for Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, arrived in Cairo to hold talks with Egypt's intelligence chief and other officials. After concluding the talks on Thursday morning, Hamas put out a statement saying they focused on the need for all terms of the deal to be fulfilled, particularly regarding deliveries of caravans, tents, heavy construction equipment, medical supplies and fuel. It added that the talks were ""positive"" and that the mediators had agreed to work to ""remove obstacles and close gaps"". ""Accordingly, Hamas reaffirms its commitment to implementing the agreement as signed, including the exchange of prisoners according to the specified timeline."" At the same time, Egyptian state-run Al Qahera TV reported that Egypt and Qatar had successfully ""overcome obstacles"" and that Israel and Hamas were committed to fully implementing the ceasefire deal. Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV also said the negotiations had been successful and that mobile homes and heavy machinery would be allowed into Gaza on Thursday. However, Israeli media then cited the Israeli prime minister's office as calling the Al Jazeera report ""fake news"" and saying there was ""no basis"" to it. Omer Dostri, a spokesman for the prime minister, later clarified the denial, writing on X: ""There is no entry of caravans or heavy equipment into the Gaza Strip, and there is no co-ordination for this."" When asked about Hamas's statement at a later media briefing, another Israeli government spokesman said Israel's position on the ceasefire agreement was ""crystal clear"". ""There is a framework in place for the release of our hostages,"" David Mencer said. ""That framework makes clear that three live hostages must be released by Hamas terrorists on Saturday."" ""If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages, by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end."" War-weary Palestinians in Gaza said they had been alarmed by the prospect of a return to fighting after 16 months of devastating war. ""When the truce was announced, we felt immense joy. However, with the announcement of a new crisis, fear returned [and] traders began raising commodity prices,"" Mouti al-Qedra told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme. ""I pray to God constantly for lasting peace, especially after the martyrdom of 65 members of the al-Qedra family. Now, we are relieved that the crisis has been resolved, hoping no more martyrs will fall."" The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza. So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal. The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named. Negotiations for the ceasefire's second phase - which should see the remaining 59 hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun. The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",Hamas says it will continue releasing Israeli hostages under Gaza deal,David Gritten,BBC News,2025-02-13T06:30:02,2025-02-13T12:28:43,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20g37rrjy1o,"Twelve people have been injured after a grenade was thrown into a busy bar in the French city of Grenoble, local authorities have said. The incident happened at the Aksehir bar shortly after 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday evening, leaving two people in critical condition. The motive for the attack is not clear but investigators say it ""may be linked to a settling of scores"". Prosecutor Francois Touret-de-Courcey said eyewitness accounts suggest the suspect, who is as yet unidentified, may also have been carrying a Kalashnikov assault rifle. Speaking to reporters at the scene, he said: ""There's nothing to make us think it's linked to terrorism,"" describing the incident as an ""act of extreme violence"". He added that investigators were looking at possible connections to drug trafficking. Authorities said many people were at the venue, located in the city's Olympic Village neighbourhood, when the suspect briefly entered. Some 80 firefighters and police officers were deployed to the scene with the area remaining cordoned off on Thursday morning, French paper Le Figaro reports. Deputy Mayor Chloe Pantel told the AFP news agency that the venue was ""a spot where locals and people from outside the neighbourhood gather, especially to watch football matches"". Police presence in the area will remain for a while, she added. Posting on X, Mayor Eric Piolle condemned what he described as a ""criminal act of extraordinary violence,"" before thanking rescue and security forces ""for their rapid intervention"".

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/13/honda-nissan-end-merger-talks-scuttling-60bn-deal,"The potential tie-up would have created the worldâ\x80\x99s third-largest automaker, rivaling US and Chinese companies. Japanâ\x80\x99s second and third-largest automakers, Honda and Nissan, have announced that their boards had voted to end talks to merge, even as they pledged to continue their cooperation on electric vehicles amid intensifying global competition. Thursdayâ\x80\x99s announcement brings to an end a potential tie-up that would have created the worldâ\x80\x99s third-largest automaker, worth some $60bn. The firms said in a joint statement that they â\x80\x9cagreed to terminate the MOU (memorandum of understanding) signed on December 23 last year for consideration of a business integration between the two companiesâ\x80\x9d. The firmsâ\x80\x99 intention to join forces had been seen as a bid to catch up with US titan Tesla andChinese firmsin the electric vehicle market. Nissan reportedly backed out of the talks with larger rival Honda after negotiations were complicated by growing differences, including Hondaâ\x80\x99s proposal that Nissan become a subsidiary, sources had previously told the Reuters news agency. In the joint statement, the automakers confirmed Honda â\x80\x9cproposed changing the structure from establishing a joint holding companyâ
\x80¦ to a structure where Honda would be the parent company and Nissan the subsidiary through a share exchangeâ\x80\x9d. As a result of the talks, both companies concluded that â\x80\x9cit would be most appropriate to cease discussions and terminate the MOU,â\x80\x9d the statement said. They will, however, continue to â\x80\x9ccollaborate within the framework of a strategic partnership aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles, striving to create new value and maximise the corporate value of both companiesâ\x80\x9d, it added. The automakers, and junior partner Mitsubishi Motors, had announced they would consider the merger late last year. Sources later told Reuters that Mitsubishi was unlikely to participate. Honda and Nissan have seen their industry and the key China market upended by the rapid rise ofChinese electric vehicle makerssuch as BYD, and both are facing the prospect of tariffs in the US, another key market. With the collapse of merger talks, Nissan is now open to working with new partners, with Taiwanâ\x80\x99s Foxconn seen as one candidate. Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said on Wednesday it would consider taking a stake in Nissan but that its main aim was cooperation.

https://apnews.com/article/canada-united-states-fentanyl-czar-1cc5c1832581d3693c4663c0c6145e04,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — The man appointed by the Canadian government to help stop fentanyl from entering the United States said his goal is to totally eliminate the drug crossing the border. “Getting the number to zero is a goal and should be our goal,” Kevin Brosseau, a former member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a former national security and intelligence adviser, said Wednesday. “If it’s one pound, 10 pounds, we all know the amount of deaths that possibly could represent. We should be focused on eliminating the scourge that is fentanyl in this country and in the United States,” he said. The Canadian government announced Brosseau’s appointment as its fentanyl czar Tuesday. The move was partly in response to President Donald Trump saying the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the U.S. was a reason for threatening to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods – with an exception of 10% on energy. Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4. “This is a clear demonstration of how serious Canada is taking the fentanyl crisis in his country and how important our relationship is with our American counterparts,” said Brosseau, who was speaking after touring a Canada Border Services Agency port of entry facility in Lansdowne, Ontario. Brosseau said his job will be to work to integrate the different levels of law enforcement. “I’m hoping to be able to give an intensity to the work,” he said. “My mandate is clear, to be able to bring people together to integrate the work and produce results.” Figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) show the agency seized 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) of fentanyl at the northern border last year. That compares to 9,570 kilograms (21,098 pounds) at the southwestern border. Brosseau spent more than 20 years in the RCMP, where he served as a deputy commissioner and the senior Mountie in the province of Manitoba. More recently, he was deputy national security and intelligence adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Brosseau said he plans on meeting with Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, and other U.S. officials soon. “I’ve spent a number of years working in law enforcement,” he said. “I know how important those relationships, those collaborations are on the ground. We’re stronger together.” Besides appointing Brosseau, the Canadian government has also announced it is spending CDN$1.3 billion (US$910 million) on increased border security which includes new helicopters, technology and personnel. Speaking at the same event, David McGuinty, Canada’s public safety minister, was asked about the challenges on dealing with President Trump. “There’s a lot at stake for people in the United States and in Canada,” said McGuinty. “There is a way to find our way forward here. I think the administration knows that.” “I think it’s going to take cool heads and a disciplined approach to find our way forward.” McGuinty also reacted to Trump’s continued statements about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state. “Canada is an independent and sovereign country,” he said. “It will remain. So that’s just not up for discussion.” ___ This story has been updated to correct the U.S. dollar conversion for the increased spending to $910 million, not $91 million.",Canada’s new fentanyl czar says goal is to totally stop the drug from entering the US,Jim Morris,AP News,2025-02-12T21:50:38,2025-02-12T22:35:09,gemini-2.0-flash

Citing “various credible sources,” the rights office said it estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed in the protests between July 15 and Aug. 5 — the day longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India amid the uprising. Thousands more were injured in the weeks leading up to and after the protests, and the vast majority of those killed and injured “were shot by Bangladesh’s security forces,” the report said. AP correspondent Mimmi Montgomery reports on new United Nations data finding hundreds of people were killed in Bangladesh’s crackdown on student-led protesters. Over 11,700 people were detained, the report said, citing information from security services. It said that about 12 to 13% of people estimated to have be killed —- or as many as about 180 people — were children. In some cases, “security forces engaged in summary executions by deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at point blank range,” it said. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk cited signs that “extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture” were conducted with the knowledge and coordination of the political leadership and top security officials as a way to suppress the protests. The U.N. fact-finding team was deployed to Bangladesh at the invitation of the country’s interim leader, the Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, to look into the uprising and violent crackdown. The team of investigators said the interim government has reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with attacks on religious and indigenous groups. The report said “many perpetrators of acts of revenge, violence and attacks on distinct groups apparently continue to enjoy impunity.” The human rights situation in Bangladesh continues to raise concerns, the U.N. office said. While the government has changed, “the system has not necessarily changed,” Rory Mungoven, head of the rights office’s Asia-Pacific region, told reporters. “Many officials and people who had served or been appointed under the previous regime continue to function,” he said. Such a situation creates “a potential conflict of interest” and could impede reforms and accountability, Mungoven added. The investigators issued dozens of recommendations to the government, such as steps to improve the justice system and setting up a witness protection program. It also recommended banning the use of lethal firearms by security forces to disperse crowds unless they are faced with “imminent threat of death or serious injury.” In a statement after the report was published, Yunus reiterated his government’s commitment to upholding the rule of law and said it was crucial to reform the country’s law enforcement and justice sectors. “I call on everyone working inside these institutions to side with justice, the law, and the people of Bangladesh in holding to account their own peers and others who have broken the law and violated the human and civil rights of their fellow citizens,” he said. What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party. A High Court decision in early June that reinstated the quota system was the “immediate trigger” to the protests, which were also fueled by long standing grievances about economic inequality and a lack of rights, the report said. —— AP writer Julhas Alam in Dhaka contributed to the report.","UN rights office estimates up to 1,400 killed in crackdown on protests in Bangladesh",JAMEY KEATEN,AP News,2025-02-12T09:31:48,2025-02-12T04:25:10,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-claims-positive-signs-as-qatar-egypt-scramble-to-resolve-gaza-truce-crisis/,"As Israeli and American officials continued to threaten Hamas on Wednesday, several reports said Egypt and Qatar were intensifying efforts to save the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, with Cairo and the Palestinian terror group reportedly optimistic that the impasse could be solved. The ceasefire has looked increasingly fragile since Hamas said this week it was postponing the release of any more Israeli hostages held in Gaza until further notice, accusing Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement. US President Donald Trump then warned that â

Jerusalem also reiterated the threat of a renewal of the war, with Defense Minister Israel Katz warning that if Hamas does not release Israeli hostages by Saturday, “the gates of hell will open, just as the US president promised.”

Katz vowed that renewed fighting in Gaza “will be different in its intensity compared to before the ceasefire, and will not end without the defeat of Hamas and release all the hostages, and will also allow the realization of US President Trump’s vision for Gaza.”

Egyptian sources told Reuters that Qatar and Egypt were in discussions with Hamas and Israel to prevent the cancellation of the ceasefire deal and to ensure its completion.

Egypt’s state-affiliated Al Qahera news TV said the pressure by the mediators was intensifying, citing an Egyptian source.

A Palestinian source told AFP that Qatar and Egypt were “working extensively” to resolve the crisis, adding that the Arab mediators were in touch with the Trump administration as part of their effort.

A Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Wednesday to continue ceasefire talks, the terror group said in a statement.

An Egyptian official with knowledge of the talks told AP that the two sides were close to an agreement. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said Israel had committed to delivering more tents, shelters and heavy equipment to Gaza.

An official with Hamas, Mahmoud Merdawi, cited “positive signals” that the hostages would be released on Saturday, the news agency said. But he cautioned that the group had yet to receive the guarantees it seeks from Israel regarding the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Egypt and Qatar, alongside the United States, brokered the deal that took effect on January 19 after more than a year of extensive diplomatic efforts.

Sixteen Israeli hostages have been released since, out of 33 on a list to be freed in the 42-day first phase of the deal. In all, Hamas is holding 73 of the 251 hostages it abducted on October 7, 2023; some 30 of them are believed to be alive.

“They are working intensively to resolve the crisis and compel Israel to implement the humanitarian protocol in the ceasefire agreement and begin negotiations for the second phase,” added the unnamed Palestinian source. Israel has denied violations of the ceasefire, including claims that it has limited aid in Gaza.

On Tuesday, United Nations humanitarian aid officials reported there has been a spike in deliveries since the ceasefire started, but did not provide specific details that could settle the spat between Israel and Hamas.

The three-stage ceasefire agreement, reached last month, halted some 15 months of fighting triggered by the group’s October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel, when Hamas-led terrorists slaughtered some 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 hostages.

The deal requires Hamas to release all its hostages, Israel to release several thousand Palestinian security prisoners — including hundreds of terror convicts serving life sentences — and a halt to fighting in the Strip, followed by negotiations for a “sustainable calm” and IDF withdrawal from the enclave.

The three-week-old truce, only halfway through its first stage, has come under immense strain in recent days following Hamas’s announcement.

Hamas praises Jordan and Egypt for opposing Gazans’ relocation

Meanwhile, Hamas praised Jordan and Egypt on Wednesday for their repeated rejections of Trump’s plan to take over Gaza and displace its population to the two neighboring countries.

The terror group said in a separate statement that the Jordanian and Egyptian positions “confirm that there is an Arab plan to reconstruct Gaza without displacing its people.”

The US plan was at the top of the agenda during Trump’s Tuesday Oval Office meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah, who sought to cautiously repel the idea without upsetting Trump.

He announced that Amman would take in 2,000 sick Gazan children — a figure that amounts to 0.1% of the Strip’s population.

“That’s music to my ears,” said a gratified Trump, who still proceeded to raise the idea of using “parcels of land” in Egypt and Jordan to house Palestinians.

Abdullah responded that he’d have to do what was best for his country, adding that Arab countries, led by Egypt, were putting together their plan for the rehabilitation of Gaza.

Hours later, the Egyptian foreign ministry announced that it would soon be presenting its plan for a “comprehensive vision for the reconstruction” of the Gaza Strip that ensures Palestinians remain on the territory.

Egypt announced earlier this week it would hold an “emergency Arab summit” on February 27 addressing Trump’s plan.

Notably, the White House readout on the meeting between Trump and Abdullah made no direct mention of Trump’s desire for Jordan to take in Palestinians.

“The two leaders also discussed the President’s goal of ensuring that Gaza is rebuilt beautifully after the conflict ends and providing options for the people of Gaza that allow them to live in security and dignity, and free of Hamas’s tyranny,” it said.

Trump asked Jordan’s King Abdullah to help ensure that Hamas understands “the severity of the situation” if the terror group does not release the hostages by Saturday, the readout added. Abdullah is not known to have noteworthy contacts with Hamas.

“The president reiterated that Hamas must release all hostages, including all Americans, by Saturday, and asked for the King’s assistance in ensuring that Hamas, as well as the leaders of the region, understand the severity of the situation,” the US readout added.

Trump extended a White House invitation to Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, with onlookers believing the visit would come shortly after that of Abdullah.

But such a sit-down has yet to be scheduled, apparently as Cairo seeks to finalize its Gaza plan first.

An unconfirmed report from Reuters citing anonymous Egyptian security sources claimed Wednesday that Sissi would not travel to Washington if Trump’s plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza remains on the agenda — a likely unrealistic expectation, given that Trump has repeatedly stood by the plan.

Sissi and Abdullah held a phone call on Wednesday, during which they reiterated their stance that Gaza should be rebuilt without displacing Palestinians, according to Egypt’s presidency.

“The two leaders affirmed the unity of the Egyptian and Jordanian positions, including the necessity of the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, the continued release of hostages and prisoners and facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid,” the Egyptian readout said, stressing the need for the “immediate start of the reconstruction process in the Gaza Strip, without displacing the Palestinian people from their land.”

The aversion to Trump’s plan is widespread in the Arab world. The United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, said on Wednesday that the US approach to Gaza is “difficult.”

“But at the end of the day, we’re all in a solution-seeking business. We just don’t know where it’s going to land yet,” he said during the World Governments Summit in Dubai.

At the summit, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit warned that if Trump pressed ahead with his plan, he would lead the Middle East into a new cycle of crises with a “damaging effect on peace and stability.”","Hamas claims ‘positive signs’ as Qatar, Egypt scramble to resolve Gaza truce crisis","Agencies, Jacob Magid, Emanuel Fabian",The Times of Israel,2025-02-12T18:21:44,2025-02-12T22:43:17,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/russia-syria-putin-sharaa-cc60fa41024e200cf1d0f6f8022bfb1c,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday spoke to Syria’s new leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, the first such top-level contact since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad. The Kremlin said the “constructive and business-like” conversation touched upon “acute issues of practical cooperation in trade and economic, education and other spheres,” adding that the leaders agreed to continue contacts to develop a “broad agenda for the development of bilateral cooperation.” The call followed last month’s visit to Damascus by a delegation of Russian officials, which marked the first such trip since Assad was ousted in December and granted an asylum in Russia. Moscow had staunchly backed Assad throughout Syria’s civil war and since 2015 waged a military that helped his government reclaim control over most of the country. Following Assad’s fall, Russia relocated its troops and assets from all over Syria to its main hub at the Hmeimim air base near Latakia. The Kremlin and the interim government in Damascus have said that the fate of the Russian air base and the nearby naval facility in Tartus will be discussed in future negotiations. At his annual news conference in December, Putin said Russia offered Syria’s new leaders to use the Russian bases for humanitarian aid deliveries and suggested Moscow could offer other incentives. The new Syrian authorities have terminated a contract for a Russian company to modernize the Tartus commercial port, but that move did not directly impact the Russian naval facility, which was leased under a separate deal.","Putin has a 'constructive' conversation in first call with Syria's new leader, Kremlin says",,AP News,2025-02-12T15:17:37,2025-02-12T12:15:23,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/eu-us-tariffs-trump-trade-war-leyen-0b23d25d30428eb288b79bfda4fa25e9,"BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum “will not go unanswered,” European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Tuesday, adding that they will trigger tough countermeasures from the 27-nation bloc. It means iconic U.S. industries like bourbon, jeans and motorcycles should beware. “The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,” von der Leyen said in a statement in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum on Monday. “Tariffs are taxes — bad for business, worse for consumers,” von der Leyen said. “Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered — they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.” The EU trade minister scheduled a first emergency video meeting on the bloc’s response on Tuesday. “It is also important that everyone sticks together. Difficult times require such full solidarity,” said Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU presidency. Just as Trump imposed similar tariffs during his first presidency, the EU countermeasures could easily amount to those that were used to retaliate then if the measures come into force March 12. Bernd Lange, the chair of the European Parliament’s trade committee, warned that previous trade measures were only suspended and could legally be easily revived. “When he starts again now, then we will, of course, immediately reinstate our countermeasures,” Lange told rbb24 German radio. ”Motorcycles, jeans, peanut butter, bourbon, whiskey and a whole range of products that of course also affect American exporters” would be targeted, he added. The EU Commission, which negotiates trade relations on behalf of the bloc, said it is not clear what countermeasures would apply, but officials and observers have said they would target Republican states and traditionally strong U.S. exports. In Germany, the EU’s largest economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told parliament that “if the U.S. leaves us no other choice, then the European Union will react united,” adding: “Ultimately, trade wars always cost both sides prosperity.” European steel companies are bracing for losses. “It will further worsen the situation of the European steel industry, exacerbating an already dire market environment,” said Henrik Adam, president of the Eurofer European steel association. He said the EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports. The United States is the second biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports. “Losing a significant part of these exports cannot be compensated by EU exports to other markets.” Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax in the hope that they will give local producers relief from intense global competition, allowing them to charge higher prices. EU Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič said that the tariffs are “economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains established through our extensive transatlantic trade and investment ties.” “We will protect our workers, businesses and consumers,” Šefčovič said, but added that “it is not our preferred scenario. We remain committed to constructive dialog. We stand ready for negotiations and to find mutually beneficial solutions where possible.” The EU estimates that the trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing some 30% of global trade. “There is a lot at stake for both sides,” he told the EU legislature. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services. The EU says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth 688 billion euros ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros ($107 billion) for the EU. ___ Associated Press writers Geir Moulson in Berlin and Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.",EU vows to retaliate against Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum,Raf Casert,AP News,2025-02-11T08:33:15,2025-02-11T09:49:10,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-turkey-erdogan-visit-defense-economic-talks-8ae96251f8743896605e8d2c31d0fab1,"BOGOR, Indonesia (AP) — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto on Wednesday for talks aimed at strengthening economic and defense ties between the two Muslim-majority nations. Erdogan’s state visit to Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country and Southeast Asia’s largest economy, was his second stop in a four-day visit that also includes Malaysia and Pakistan. Turkey and Indonesia held their first High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council summit after agreeing to create the forum at the G20 Summit in Bali in 2022. The discussions focused on current regional and global issues, particularly the war in Gaza, the two leaders said in a joint news conference after the meeting. Subianto said the meeting was “intensive and productive” and the two countries share a commitment to strengthen their partnership. “President Erdogan’s visit is a new chapter in our strategic partnership,” he added. Indonesia has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinians and Subianto said the two countries share the same view about the importance of a cease-fire and of resolving the Palestinian problem through a two-state solution. Erdogan said he appreciated Indonesia’s firm stance on the Palestinian issue and repeated a call for Israel to pay for the reconstruction of Gaza.. Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. He estimated the total damage caused by Israel’s 15-month-long attacks is approaching $100 billion, adding that “the principle in law is that damages should be collected from the person responsible.” Erdogan and his wife, First Lady Emine Erdogan, arrived in Jakarta late Tuesday and was welcomed by Subianto at Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport in a light rain. Erdogan rode with Subianto in a motorcade to his hotel. Indonesia and Turkey have built an increasingly close relationship in recent years, and the two leaders previously met in Ankara last July when Subianto was still president-elect and defense minister. Subianto pledged to “elevate defense cooperation and other strategic fields for mutual benefit.” The two countries signed a defense cooperation agreement in 2010, under which Indonesia’s state-run arms producer Pindad and Turkey’s FNSS jointly developed a new model of medium tank. In 2023, the two countries inked a plan of action for joint military exercises and defense industry cooperation. In addition to Indonesia, Turkey has HLSCC cooperation forums with 21 other countries, including Pakistan. The two leaders on Wednesday also witnessed the signing of a dozen agreements between Turkey and Indonesia, including on trade, investment, education, energy, agriculture, health and religious services. The two leaders also signed deal on the joint development of a Baykar combat-drone factory in Indonesia, and Erdogan pledged his country would invest in the development of Indonesia’s new capital on Borneo island. “We are trying to increase our trade by $10 billion per year with the same balance,” Erdogan said. Erdogan will head on to Pakistan on Wednesday, where he and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will address the Pakistan-Turkey Business and Investment Forum and attend another HSLCC meeting. ___ Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.

https://apnews.com/article/japan-us-tariffs-steel-aluminum-exemption-be1b1c2cb912af55edf4748119b3953a,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan ‘s government said Wednesday it asked the U.S. to exclude it from 25% steel and aluminum tariffs, a change from duty-free quotas that Tokyo was given previously. Japan made the request through its embassy in Washington after U.S. President Donald Trump removed the exceptions and exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel imports to a minimum of 25%, while hiking aluminum tariffs to 25% from 10%. “Japan will firmly take necessary steps as we fully examine details of the new measures and their possible impact on the Japanese economy,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, suggesting that his country will lobby for an exemption in the coming weeks before the measures are due to take effect. The measures announced by Trump are part of his aggressive push to reset global trade in the belief that tax hikes on foreign-made products will strengthen domestic manufacturing. Japan was given an annual duty-free quota of up to 1.25 million tons of steel under the former President Joe Biden ’s administration. Japan’s exported 1.18 million tons of steel to the U.S. in 2024, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-netanyahu-troops-beefed-up-ceasefire-39533292445c3fe25d0d2d460439305d,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday threatened to withdraw from the ceasefire in Gaza and directed troops to prepare to resume fighting Hamas if the militant group does not r elease more hostages on Saturday. Hamas said Monday — and reiterated Tuesday — that it planned to delay the release of three more hostages after accusing Israel of failing to meet the terms of the ceasefire, including by not allowing an agreed-upon number of tents and other aid into Gaza. Amid the mounting tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump emboldened Israel to call for the release of even more remaining hostages on Saturday. Trump questions ceasefire’s durability After meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday, Trump predicted Hamas would not release all the remaining hostages as he had demanded. “I don’t think they’re going to make the deadline, personally,” the president said of Hamas. “They want to play tough guy. We’ll see how tough they are.” Since the ceasefire took effect, Hamas has released 21 hostages in a series of five exchanges for more than 730 Palestinian prisoners. A second phase calls for the return of all remaining hostages and an indefinite extension of the truce. However, Trump’s statements about both the pending releases and plans for post-war Gaza have destabilized its fragile architecture. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Netanyahu’s threat referred to the three hostages scheduled for release on Saturday or all the remaining hostages, which would be a departure from the terms of the ceasefire. Netanyahu’s office said it “welcomed President Trump’s demand.” As Trump spoke to reporters in Washington and reasserted his demands, an Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting, said Israel was “sticking to Trump’s announcement regarding the release of the hostages. Namely, that they will all be released on Saturday.” Netanyahu’s office also said it ordered the military to mobilize troops on and around the Gaza Strip in preparation for scenarios that could arise. Trump has said Israel should cancel the entire ceasefire if all of the roughly 70 hostages aren’t freed by Saturday. Hamas brushed off his threat Tuesday, doubling down on its claim that Israel has violated the ceasefire and warned that it would only continue releasing hostages if all parties adhered to the ceasefire. “Trump must remember there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties. This is the only way to bring back prisoners,” Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said Tuesday. “The language of threats has no value; it only complicates matters.” The group later condemned Trump’s White House remarks, saying they amounted to a “call for ethnic cleansing” and accusing Trump of seeking to “liquidate the Palestinian cause and deny the national rights of the Palestinian people.” It said in a statement it remained committed to the ceasefire, yet did not address its plans to suspend the hostages releases outlined in the first phase of the agreement. Jordan — a U.S. ally — faces new pressures Trump hosted King Abdullah II in Washington as he escalates pressure on Jordan to take in refugees from Gaza, perhaps permanently, as part of his audacious plan to remake the Middle East. “We’re not going to buy anything. We’re going to have it,” Trump said of U.S. control of Gaza as the Jordanian king stood by. Abdullah II was asked repeatedly by reporters about Trump’s plan to remake the Middle East, but didn’t make substantive comments. He also did not comment on the idea that a large number of refugees from Gaza could be welcomed in Jordan, where millions of Palestinian refugees already reside. The king said, however, that Jordan would be willing “right away” to take as many as 2,000 children in Gaza who have cancer or are otherwise ill. Last week, the top World Health Organization official for Gaza said between 12,000 and 14,000 patients still need medical evacuation from the territory — including 5,000 children. Palestinians and the international community have seethed over Trump’s recent comments that any Palestinians potentially expelled from Gaza would not have a right to return. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas committed to freeing 33 hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, while Israel said it would release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The sides have carried out five swaps since Jan. 19. The war could resume in early March if no agreement is reached on the more complicated second phase of the ceasefire. But if it does, Israel will face a drastically different battlefield. After forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to evacuate to southern Gaza in the early stages of the war, Israel allowed many of those displaced people to return to what is left of their homes, posing a new challenge to its ability to move ground troops through the territory. ___ Metz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-critical-chemicals-act-save-shrinking-industry-france/,"Europe's mighty chemicals industry is in decline — but France is pitching a plan to get it back on track. Once one of the jewels of European manufacturing, the chemicals' sector has been plunged into a deep malaise over recent years, at least in part because of a surge in energy costs. The crisis reached fever pitch when even German heavyweight BASF said last year that it would be making a multibillion investment in China, as it had found business tough in its home market. In a bid to keep the business in Europe, Paris wants the European Union to declare 15 key chemical compounds ""strategic,"" copying similar EU policies for raw materials and medicines. The idea is to protect the sector to ensure Europe remains self-sufficient in chemicals used in everything from fertilizer production to plastics manufacturing. France, a top global chemical producer, warns the sector is facing a ""major crisis,"" citing a 12 percent drop in production between 2019 and 2023, which it blames on rising energy costs and ""fierce or even unfair competition from non-EU countries."" ""Regarding petrochemistry alone, by 2035, about 20 steam crackers may be shut down, affecting 50,000 jobs, if no collective action is taken,"" reads the draft proposal obtained by POLITICO. The proposed ""Critical Chemicals Act"" would identify 15 molecules as ""strategic,"" bringing them under an EU ""strategic project"" label to enable funding access. The idea borrows from the Critical Raw Materials Act — under which ""strategic projects"" can benefit from faster permitting procedures and additional funding — and the Critical Medicines Act. Those ""strategic"" molecules are to be the building blocks for other industries, with substances like ammonia and methanol supporting agriculture and energy, and ethylene, propylene, butadiene and benzene serving the petrochemical industry. France is Europe's second-largest producer of chemicals with a turnover of €108.5 billion in 2023, according to the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC). Europe is the second-largest chemicals producer in the world after China. According to the proposal, the act should also create support schemes for chemical plants that need investment to decarbonize and modernize, as well as for chemical plants whose closure would “jeopardize European sovereignty.” The act is an ""opportunity to acknowledge this needed [green] transition and support frontrunners in this matter,"" said Noémie Jégou, chemicals policy officer at the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), highlighting the energy-intensive sector's contribution to climate change. ""But we must ensure strategic priorities do focus on non-toxic and clean chemicals and do not come at the expense of human health and the environment."" CEFIC, for its part, welcomed France's concern for the chemicals industry — but said further work is needed to ""refine and confirm that this is the right approach."" Competing chemicals The past few years have seen steady job cuts in the chemical sector, most recently at Dow. CEFIC warned last month that Europe's chemical industry is at a “breaking point”: Over 11 million tons of capacity have already been announced for closure affecting 21 major sites, it said. France points to the gap in energy and feedstock costs between the EU and other industrial regions, due largely to soaring gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The paper also complains of ""sometimes unfair"" competition from non-EU producers — citing Europe's struggling polyvinyl chloride (PVC) industry as an example — and of a contraction in the activity of downstream markets for chemical products, like the automotive industry. German Chemical Industry Association President Markus Steilemann has accused Brussels of “regulating Europe into a standstill,” describing it as the “epicenter of bureaucracy.” France, too, hints at the need to simplify EU green rules, urging that incoming laws on chemical safety and forever chemicals ""take into account the competitiveness of the European chemical industry."" Non-EU imported chemicals should also ""abide by high-level standards in place in the EU regarding the protection of the environment and human health,"" the paper states. The EEB's Jégou acknowledged the industry downturn but insisted it remains ""in a very competitive situation."" And while she welcomed the proposal's pledge not to compromise environmental protections, the NGO is ""concerned about potential conflicts between some molecules’ strategic status and their environmental and health impacts,"" singling out the proposal's focus on PVC and flame-retardant materials. CEFIC said it shared France's objective of ""preserving the production of chemicals in Europe for which resilience is crucial"" — but has reservations about the proposal's definition of strategic molecules. It argues that ""not only basic building blocks are at risk"" but ""some key derivatives as well."" ""It is also difficult to determine if similar measures to the Critical Raw Materials Act and the Critical Medicines Act would benefit the chemical sector, given the limited experience,"" the lobby added, calling for a ""deeper reflection of the measures that would help the sector"" after the upcoming publication of the Clean Industrial Deal.",France pitches plan to halt decline of EU chemical industry,Leonie Cater,POLITICO,2025-02-12T03:36:35,2025-02-12T03:36:45,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/02/12/2003831728,"Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) and Minister of Culture Li Yuan (李遠) yesterday held a meeting in New Taipei City to discuss “cultural diplomacy,” with a particular focus on the upcoming World Expo in Japan and cultural events in European nations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) in a statement said it was the first time the two ministries held ministerial-level talks. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois Wu (吳志中) and Deputy Minister of Culture Minister Sue Wang (王時思) were also in attendance. During the meeting, both sides talked about combining MOFA and the Ministry of Culture’s resources to boost the nation’s visibility on the world stage, the statement said. One focus was the Osaka World Expo, which is to be held from April 13 to Oct. 13, it added. Lin proposed that Taiwan work closely with allies to hold activities and stage artistic performances during the Osaka event. Another focus for both ministries is to take advantage of the National Palace Museum’s upcoming exhibitions in the Czech Republic and France later this year, and the ministries would work together to hold a series of cultural and artistic events promoting Taiwan’s diverse culture with the theme of “Taiwan Culture Year,” the statement said. MOFA said the ministries worked together last year when the nation participated in the Paris Cultural Olympiad during the Olympic Games. They set up a Taiwan Pavilion at Parc de la Villette from July 27 to Aug. 10, with 22 Taiwanese performing arts groups appearing. DRIVING IN ESTONIA In other news, MOFA yesterday said that people who have a driver’s license issued in Taiwan, an international driving permit and a translation of the driver’s license in Estonian can now drive in Estonia, adding that it is considering offering a reciprocal deal to the European nation. Department of European Affairs Deputy Director-General Josephine Lee (李秀窈) said the Estonian Transport Administration announced the policy on its Web site. “Visitors who hold a valid Taiwan driver’s license and will not be staying in Estonia for more than 12 months, can now use the original copy of their driver’s license, the original copy of their international driving permit and a translation of the driver’s license in Estonian to drive in Estonia,” Lee said. Those wishing to obtain an Estonian translation of their driver’s license can visit the Web site of the Estonian Ministry of Justice and Digital Affairs () and contact a sworn translator of their choice to obtain a translation, Lee said. The cost of the translation is generally 60 to 100 euros (US$62 to US$103), and usually they receive it in two to three working days, she said, adding the translated document does not need to be further certified by the consular service office in Estonia. “The policy makes it more convenient for Taiwanese tourists and businesspeople,” Lee said. “MOFA welcomes and thanks the Estonian government for offering it to our people.” Based on the principle of reciprocity, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications is considering offering the same treatment to Estonians visiting Taiwan, she said. Meanwhile, Lee said the Greek government on Feb. 2 declared a state of emergency in Santorini, a popular tourist island hit by a series of earthquakes, and it would remain in effect until early next month. “MOFA reminds people who are planning to visit the area to stay alert and pay attention to the Greek government’s latest announcements, and avoid entering zones that have been deemed unsafe,” she said. People who need emergency assistance when visiting Greece are advised to call the Taipei Representative Office in Greece’s emergency phone number, or ask their family or friends in Taiwan to call the ministry’s all-hours emergency hotline, Lee said.",Ministries eyeing ‘cultural diplomacy’,Lee I-chia,Taipei Times,2025-02-12T00:00:00,2025-02-12T14:11:29,gemini-2.0-flash

https://kyivindependent.com/fires-reported-following-missile-attack-on-kyiv/,"Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a missile attack against Kyiv on the morning of Feb. 12, killing one person and injuring four others, including a child. Various officials reported that fires had broken out in different neighborhoods of the city. At least one person was killed and four others injured, including a 9-year-old girl, in the Obolon district of the city after a Russian missile struck an office building, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. At least two of the injured victims required hospitalization. In the Holosiivskyi district, a large fire engulfed a warehouse, while in the Solomianskyi district, the roof of a residential building caught fire. An office of the state news channels Freedom TV and Dim were damaged in the attack, the channels said in a statement, reporting no casualties. Explosions were reported in Kyiv around 4:30 a.m. local time, according to several Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. Preliminary reports indicate that four Iskander ballistic missiles were launched towards the capital. Ukraine's Air Force warned immediately prior of the threat of Russian missile attacks targeting various regions of the country. The air raid alerts were lifted about an hour later at 5:30 a.m. local time. Damage was also reported elsewhere in Kyiv Oblast. A warehouse storing feed for animals from shelters was destroyed in Russian attacks in the region overnight, said the non-profit running the warehouse. No staff members were injured. In recent months, Russia has continued to intensify its drone and missile attacks targeting different regions of Ukraine.","Russian ballistic missile attack on Kyiv kills 1, injures 4",Dmytro Basmat,The Kyiv Independent,2025-02-11T21:56:39.000,2025-02-12T08:15:10.000,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj91d3jkpvlo,"When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Washington and meets President Donald Trump later on Thursday, there will be some warm hugs and shared laughs. But that will not be all. Trump and Modi have developed a strong personal rapport over the years, marked by high-profile meetings and joint appearances. This time, they will also hold a joint press briefing, according to the White House. Since their first meeting in Washington in 2017, their bond has grown through other events, including joint appearances at massive rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad. Their chemistry stems from shared worldviews and politics and a mutual strategic focus on countering China, a concern that has also strengthened the broader US-India partnership. Not surprisingly, Trump has often criticised India, but he has never criticised Modi. And so, during Modi's visit, the two leaders will probably spend time mapping out next steps in the US-India strategic partnership, which is already in a good place. Modi will reportedly meet several members of Trump's cabinet, as well as US business leaders and members of the Indian-American community. He may also meet SpaceX and Tesla chief Elon Musk. Modi, keen to scale up India's burgeoning electric vehicles sector, would be happy if Musk opened a Tesla factory in India. And yet the Trump-Modi conviviality and heady talk of strategic partnership may mask a sobering reality: during Modi's visit, the relationship's transactional side will come into sharp relief with each leader, especially Trump, armed with an array of demands. Delhi knows Trump well. Many of Modi's current cabinet ministers also served during his previous term, which overlapped with part of the first Trump administration. That familiarity has been on display since Trump's inauguration last month: Delhi has publicly signalled its willingness to lower tariffs, take back undocumented Indian immigrants and buy American oil. It has already lowered some tariffs and taken back 104 undocumented Indians, with the first plane arriving in India last week. These pre-emptive steps are meant to prevent Trump from making specific demands of India and to reduce the likelihood of tensions with the new Trump administration. Still, Trump may ask Modi to make additional tariff reductions, to further chip away at a US goods and services trade deficit with India that has approached $46bn (£37.10bn) in recent years. On Wednesday evening, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump planned to announce reciprocal tariffs on other countries before his meeting with Modi. But an obstacle could become an opportunity: Modi may call on Trump to enter into bilateral talks on an economic partnership accord meant to reduce tariffs on both sides. In recent years, Delhi has shown a growing willingness to pursue trade deals. The Trump administration may prove to be a more willing interlocutor than the Biden administration, which imposed heavy environmental and labour-related conditions on new trade agreements. What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? Trump may also ask Modi to take back more undocumented Indians. Given that some estimates put the number at more than 700,000 - the third-largest such group in the US - this will be a difficult and delicate issue for Delhi to navigate.  Last week, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament that the government was working with the US to ensure Indian citizens were not mistreated while being deported after reports of them being shackled sparked anger. Trump may also call on Modi to buy more American oil. In 2021, India was the top destination for American oil exports, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought major changes in global oil markets and prompted Delhi to ramp up imports of cheap oil from close partner Russia. The price point will determine how much oil India is willing to buy from the US. Modi may also come with his own energy ask: invest in Indian nuclear energy. Delhi is amending its nuclear liability law and has announced a new nuclear energy mission, in an attempt to sharpen international interest in the fuel. India aims to meet half its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. Asking Trump to invest in nuclear fuel amounts to a potential happy medium: it is cleaner than fossil fuels, but far removed from the solar and wind power that may not strike the Trump administration as an attractive investment. Technology will probably be discussed as well. This was a fast-growing space for bilateral relations in the Biden era, thanks to the 2022 implementation of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which both sides view as a new cornerstone for strategic partnership. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it. Modi will likely seek assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they remain committed to this. Given Washington's focus on countering China by making India a bigger part of tech global supply chains, they probably will. Also on the tech co-operation front, Modi may make a pitch for Trump to maintain the H-1B visa regime. These visas for highly skilled foreign workers, heavily criticised by some influential Trump supporters, have been awarded to large numbers of Indian tech employees in the US. Other countries may also come up during Modi's conversations in Washington. Iran could loom especially large. Delhi is partnering with Tehran to develop a port in Chabahar city - part of a broader Indian strategy to strengthen connectivity links with Central Asia, via Iran and Afghanistan. But last week, the US administration released a presidential memorandum outlining Trump's ","Trade, tariffs and visas to dominate Trump-Modi talks",Michael Kugelman,BBC News,2025-02-11T19:08:39,2025-02-13T01:20:50,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-war-threat-europe-within-5-years-danish-intelligence-ddis-warns/,"An updated threat assessment warns of the consequences of a divided NATO and an absent U.S. If Moscow perceives NATO as weak, Russia could be ready to wage a ""large-scale war"" in Europe within five years, the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS)has said. ""Russia is likely to be more willing to use military force in a regional war against one or more European NATO countries if it perceives NATO as militarily weakened or politically divided,"" states the report, which was released Tuesday. ""This is particularly true if Russia assesses that the U.S. cannot or will not support the European NATO countries in a war with Russia,"" it continues, emphasizing that Russia is ramping up its military capabilities to prepare for a possible war against NATO. The updated DDIS threat assessment comes as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to end the war in Ukraine, which enters its fourth year later this month. The agency offers three scenarios that could occur if the Ukraine conflict stops or becomes frozen, working from the assumption that Russia does not have the capacity to wage war with multiple countries at the same time. Within six months, the update projects, Russia would be able to wage a local war with a bordering country, while within two years it could launch a regional war in the Baltic Sea region. In five years, meanwhile, it could launch a large-scale attack on Europe, provided the U.S. does not get involved. The agency notes it did not factor in any possible increase in NATO defense capabilities. Trump hasurgedNATO members to increase their defense spending to 5 percent of GDP, more than double the current target, and has suggested the U.S. couldwithdraw from the military alliance if its allies don't pay their way. In 2024 Trumpsaidhe would ""encourage"" Russia to attack any NATO member country that didnâ	 meet its financial obligations.

Ukraine launched a surprisecross-border incursioninto Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in anew offensive. The Ukrainian military continues to hold Russian territory that could play ""an important part"" infuture negotiations, Zelensky previously said. ""We will swap one territory for another,"" Zelensky toldThe Guardian, without specifying which Russian-occupied land Ukraine would seek in return. ""I don't know, we will see. But all our territories are important, there is no priority,"" he said. Talk of ending Russia'sfull-scale invasionof Ukraine has increased as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The new administration aims to end Russia's war against Ukraine100 daysfrom inauguration, Keith Kellogg, Trump's special Ukraine peace envoy, said on Jan. 8. According to sources in Ukraine's President's Office, cited byRBC-Ukraine, Kellogg will visit Ukraine on Feb. 20 after theMunich Security Conference. On Feb. 7, the U.S. president revealed he aims to meet Zelensky inWashingtonthe following week. He also recently said that the U.S. wants access to Ukraine'srare earth mineralsin exchange for aid. Zelensky has responded that Kyiv is open to mining deals with partners. Trump has alsoallegedlyspoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war. The U.S. president told the New York Post he had a concrete plan to end the war, adding, ""I hope it's fast. Every day, people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing."" Ukrainian forces struck Russia's Saratov oil refinery in a strike overnight on Feb. 11, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks in the region. Unverified videos posted to social media showed a large fire and search lights raking the sky reportedly in the vicinity of therefinery. ""The refinery mainly produces gasoline, fuel oil, and diesel fuel. In total, more than 20 types of oil products (are being produced there),"" theGeneral Staffsaid, adding that the facility suppliesRussianoccupation forces in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military reported a confirmed hit and a fire at the Rosneft facility. The full extent of damage is being determined, it added. The attack was carried out jointly by the Unmanned Systems Forces, the military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, as well as other units, according to the statement. The confirmation of the attack on the Saratov oil refinery came afterearlier reportsof a drone attack against the oil refinery lying some 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) fromUkraine'sborder. The Russian Telegram news channel Shot also reported at least 11 explosions over Engels, a city lying across the Volga River from Saratov. The Russian strategic aviationairbase Engels-2, which has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian long-range strikes, lies in the vicinity. The U.S. plans to review the deployment of its troops around the world but is not going to send them to Ukraine, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a press conference on Feb. 11. Hegseth's remarks come amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment ofpeacekeeping forcesif a ceasefire is negotiated. ""We are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine,"" Hegseth told reporters in Stuttgart, Germany, during hisvisitto U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command headquarters. Hegseth added that Washington currently has no plans to reduce the U.S. contingent abroad but will review its deployment by PresidentDonald Trump's strategic vision. The U.S. Defense Secretary also expressed hope for a swiftpeace agreementin Ukraine, which Trump has pledged to conclude. ""With hopefully a rapid peace deal in Ukraine, which the President (Donald Trump) is committed to delivering, we can then review force posture and encourage as you're going to see tomorrow (on Feb. 12) ... at the Ukraine contact group and the NATO ministerial, we're going to have straight talk with our friends,"" Hegseth said. Hegseth is expected to attend the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), also known as the Ramstein summit, as part of a tour of Germany, Belgium, and Poland, according to a Pentagonstatementpublished Feb. 7. At the summit, the defense secretary aims to ""reiterate President Trump's commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible,"" the statement read. However, this time, Hegseth is not likely to announce new military aid supplies, which was a regular occurrence during the Joe Biden administration, according to theWashington Post(WP). The Pentagon chief will not hold separate meetings with his Ukrainian counterparts but will rather be a ""listener"" at the Ramstein and at the meeting of NATO defense ministers on Feb. 13, an unnamed U.S. official told WP on condition of anonymity. The transition of power in Washington and expected changes in U.S. policy on Ukraine cast doubt on the future of the Ramstein summit. In February, for the first time since the establishment of the Ramstein format, the meeting wasconvened by the U.K., not the U.S. North Korea has provided Russia with around 200 long-range artillery pieces to boost its war effort against Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 11, citing South Korea's Defense Ministry. Seoul further warned that Pyongyang is likely preparing to send additional troops and arms to back Russia's war, confirmingearlier warningsby the Ukrainian intelligence. North Korea has reportedly also supplied ballistic missiles, millions of artillery shells, and other arms to Moscow. In addition, the country has deployed up to 12,000 troops to Russia's Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian cross-borderincursionlaunched in early August 2024. The South Korean Defense Ministry suspects that North Korea is receiving Russia's technological assistance with nuclear-powered submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in exchange for its military support,Yonhapreported. According to the Japanese public broadcaster NHK, North Korea is also expected to begindrone productionthis year with Russian technical assistance. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia's Kursk Oblast,South Korea's National Intelligence Service(NIS) claimed in mid-January. Ukraine placed North Korean losses to as many as 4,000 killed and injured. Kyiv's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov nevertheless predicted that North Korea might soon send reinforcements to Russia, namely gun and rocket artillery units. The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 thatNorth Koreantroops had been pulled from the front, and a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent at the time that Ukraine's special forces had not facedPyongyang's soldiersfor three weeks. On Feb. 7, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that North Korean soldiers were ""brought in again"" to Kursk Oblast, a day after Russian media claimed Ukraine hadlaunched a new offensivein the Russian region. Soldiers of the 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, part of the Steel Lions unit, shared footage on Feb. 11 showing a rare Russian Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher being destroyed by drones in the Lyman sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast. Drones have played a pivotal role for bothUkraineandRussiathroughout thefull-scale invasion, used extensively for reconnaissance and combat operations. According to the brigade'sstatement, Russian forces had mounted a Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launcher on a Ural vehicle and concealed it in the forests of the Lyman sector before it was targeted and destroyed. Ukraine has developed and deployed a wide range of aerial, naval, and ground-baseddronesfor battlefield operations. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv delivered more than200,000 domestically produced dronesto front-line units in December alone. The Smerch-2 is a Soviet-era rocket and bomb launcher designed to destroy submarines and attack torpedoes. It features a stationary installation with 12 radially arranged 213 mm caliber barrels and was adopted by the Soviet Navy in 1961.

El Paso's public bus fixed route transportation servicewill be running on a reduced Sunday schedule for a week starting on Wednesday, Feb. 12, due to the impact and damage from the two-alarm blaze at Sun Metro headquarters, city officials said. The fire 		 which was initially described as a vehicle explosion 		 started in a bus maintenance garage area around 1 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 11, at the Sun Metro Operations Center at 10151 Montana Ave. near Wedgewood Drive, El Paso Fire Department Assistant Chief Robert Arvizu said. The two-alarm fire was knocked down by 4:40 p.m. Tuesday even as crews continued to check for hot spots and an investigation continued, the El Paso Fire Department said via the X platform. Five people were injured in the explosion, Arvizu said. Four people were taken to hospitals, while another declined to go to the hospital, officials said. One person suffered serious injuries and three people suffered minor injuries. Three other people declined to go to the hospital. About 48 fire units and more than 100 firefighters responded to the fire, Arvizu said. The fire caused ""severe damage"" to the Sun Metro Operations Center, Arvizu said. ""The roof collapsed,"" Arvizu said. ""We had walls collapse but none of the firefighters were injured.		 El Paso Fire Department officials are conducting an investigation into the fire, Arvizu said. El Paso police officers responded to the scene to assist the fire department with traffic control, including the closure of the normally busy Montana Avenue. Montana Avenue between Wedgewood and Yarbrough drives was closed to traffic for several hours. The closure was necessary because fire crews were using fire hydrants and water lines across the street. Firefighters in ladder trucks were working to extinguish the fire as a large plume of black smoke came from the Sun Metro Operations Center. The dark smoke plume could be seen for miles across El Paso. Additional fire trucks were still arriving at the scene as of 2 p.m. Firefighting efforts continued despite gusty winds and hazy skies before a dust storm blew into the city. El Paso city officials said details about the fire and its cause are limited, adding, ""our primary focus is on containing the fire and the safety of our staff."" El Paso International Airport operations are unaffected, city officials said.

https://www.dw.com/en/algeria-nigeria-niger-sign-mou-on-gas-pipeline-to-europe/a-62633283,"Algeria, Niger and Nigeria signed a memorandum of understanding on Thursday to build a 4,000-kilometer (2,500-mile) Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline. Algeria's Energy Ministry said the natural gas pipeline would stretch across the Sahara desert. It is estimated that, once the $13 billion (€12.75 billion) pipeline is complete, it will transport up to 30 billion cubic meters (1 trillion cubic feet) of gas annually from Nigeria, in West Africa, north through Niger and on to Algeria. From there, it could be pumped through the undersea 
Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline to Europe or loaded onto Liquefied Natural Gas tankers for export. Gas pipeline in the works for a while
The idea was first proposed over 40 years ago, but progress stalled. The new momentum comes as the European Union seeks to wean itself off Russian gas during the war in Ukraine. The security situation in the Sahel region and tensions between the governments in Algiers and Niamey also delayed the project. It wasn't until 2021, when Algeria and Niger reopened their border, that discussions to construct the pipeline restarted. Earlier this week, EU member states agreed to reduce gas consumption as concerns grow that Russia might cut off already decreasing deliveries. European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had said the deal to reduce gas use was about preventing the Kremlin from being able to blackmail the EU with gas deliveries: to stop ""Russia using gas as a weapon,"" as she put it.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250211001653315?section=national/politics,"(ATTN: ADDS more details in paras 17-20)By Lee Haye-ah SEOUL, Feb. 11 (Yonhap) -- Former Interior Minister Lee Sang-min denied Tuesday that he ordered cutting off power and water to major media outlets during the short-lived imposition of martial law or received such instructions from President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee made the remarks as a witness during the seventh formal hearing of Yoon's impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, referring to allegations in the prosecution's indictment of Yoon that the president ordered him around midnight on Dec. 3 to cut off power and water to Hankyoreh, the Kyunghyang Shinmun, MBC and JTBC -- left-leaning media outlets critical of Yoon -- as well as opinion polling agency Flower Research.  ""Such measures were completely excluded from the martial law (decree) so I don't think there was reason to give such instructions,"" Lee said. ""It was a known fact that the interior minister has no authority to command the police or the firefighting agency, and the president knew that better than anyone, so he would not have given me such form of instructions,"" he added. Lee did acknowledge however that he saw a note on Yoon's desk headed with the word ""National Fire Agency chief"" and listing the names of the media outlets and the polling agency. ""I saw a few notes from afar inside the president's office and one of them mentioned the fire agency cutting off power and water,"" he said. The minister also testified that he tried to stop Yoon from declaring martial law when he was called to the presidential office on the night of Dec. 3. ""After 11 Cabinet members had gathered, President Yoon reentered wearing a suit and we discouraged the president,"" he said. ""President Yoon, however, said he is aware of its economic and diplomatic impact, and the political burden it would be, but that he had thought carefully and that a president's situation awareness and sense of crisis and responsibility were completely different from those of a Cabinet member."" Prior to Lee's testimony, Yoon asked the bench for a chance to speak. He voiced his opposition to the Constitutional Court using as evidence the prosecution's reports on interrogations of key suspects in the martial law case, saying the testimonies are inconsistent because they were given to multiple investigation agencies. Acting court President Moon Hyung-bae said he would raise the issue with the other justices. The trial has entered its final stretch with only one more scheduled hearing on Thursday, though the court could still designate additional sessions. Later Tuesday, National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik, who was also called as a witness, recalled that during a dinner with Yoon and others at a presidential safe house sometime between late March and early April, the president mentioned the need for an ""exceptional measure."" ""I understood it as the military needing to play a role in real politics,"" Shin said. ""I didn't think as far as martial law, and expressed my opinion that it would not be appropriate in any event."" Shin, who was the defense minister at the time, also said he rejected the idea as ""not very useful,"" based on his perceptions of history, the realities of the military and the public's political consciousness. Baek Jong-wook, former third deputy director of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), and Kim Yong-bin, secretary-general of the National Election Commission (NEC), also testified later in the day. Baek and Kim were called to testify regarding the election fraud allegations, cited by Yoon as a main reason for declaring martial law.  When asked about such a possibility, Baek did not give a clear statement, saying it was ""not what we saw"" and his mission was confined to checking the ballot counting system.  Baek said the NIS had found that the NEC system had vulnerabilities and could have potentially been exposed to hacking during its 2023 inspection, but that should not be viewed in the same context as the alleged election fraud.  The court, meanwhile, rejected the request from Yoon's legal team to call Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and Lee Kyung-min, acting commander of the Defense Counterintelligence Command, to testify as witnesses, deeming it unnecessary. Yoon was impeached by the National Assembly in December on charges of inciting an insurrection through his short-lived imposition of martial law. The Constitutional Court has been reviewing whether to uphold the impeachment and remove him from office or dismiss the impeachment and reinstate him. Yoon is currently being held at a detention center ahead of a separate criminal trial on the insurrection charges. hague@yna.co.kr elly@yna.co.kr(END)","(3rd LD) Ex-interior minister denies trying to cut off power, water to media outlets after martial law declaration",Kim Seung-yeon,Yonhap News Agency,2025-02-11T21:34:57,2025-02-11T21:34:57,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/yemens-houthis-say-ready-to-launch-attacks-on-israel-if-gaza-ceasefire-collapses/,"Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis, who control most of western Yemen including the capital, are ready to launch attacks on Israel if it resumes attacks on Gaza and does not commit to the ceasefire deal, the group’s leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi said in a televised speech on Tuesday. “Our hands are on the trigger and we are ready to immediately escalate against the Israeli enemy if it returns to escalation in the Gaza Strip,” al-Houthi said. The announcement came the day after Palestinian terror group Hamas threw the truce into turmoil by saying it would pause fulfilling its commitments to the ceasefire deal reached last month, alleging Israeli violations. During the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis repeatedly fired ballistic missiles and drones at Israel, in what eventually became nearly daily assaults. While most were intercepted, the attacks sent millions scrambling to bomb shelters, often in the middle of the night. Some drones and rockets hit the country, killing a man in Tel Aviv on one occasion and causing extensive damage to a school on another, as well as other damage including in the southern resort city of Eilat. The Houthis also attacked Israeli and other vessels in the Red Sea, disturbing global shipping lanes, in what they said were acts of solidarity with Gaza’s Palestinians during Israel’s war with Hamas. Israel responded to the Houthi attacks with airstrikes on the terror group’s resources in Yemen. The US and Britain have also bombed the Houthis over their attacks on shipping. The Houthis had said that they would end their assaults when the war ended in Gaza, and since the start of the ceasefire have not attacked Israel. The Gaza war started on October 7, 2023, when Hamas led thousands of terrorists to invade southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. A complex three-phase ceasefire that began last month includes the gradual release of hostages in return for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, where it launched a ground campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the October 7 attack. With five rounds of hostage-prisoner releases completed in the ongoing Gaza ceasefire deal as of last Saturday, there are 17 Israeli hostages still supposed to be returned in the first phase, in exchange for hundreds more Palestinian security prisoners. However, on Monday, Hamas said that it intended to delay the next release of Israeli hostages, slated for Saturday, “until further notice,” in response to what it claimed were Israeli violations of the ongoing hostage-ceasefire deal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in recent days kept the door open to resuming fighting with Hamas rather than continuing to a second phase of the deal, while US President Donald Trump suggested that Israel issue an ultimatum to the terror group to return all the hostages by Saturday at noon. Netanyahu is under pressure from the far-right flank of his coalition to continue the war until Hamas is completely destroyed, a declared goal of the campaign. Seventy-three of the 251 people abducted by Hamas during its October 7 onslaught remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF.",Yemen’s Houthis say ready to launch attacks on Israel if Gaza ceasefire collapses,"Reuters, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-02-11T16:23:30,2025-02-11T16:23:30,gemini-2.0-flash

Ukraine launched a surprisecross-border incursioninto Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. While Ukrainian forces have since lost roughly half that area, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in anew offensive. The Ukrainian military continues to hold Russian territory that could play ""an important part"" infuture negotiations, Zelensky previously said. ""We will swap one territory for another,"" Zelensky toldThe Guardian, without specifying which Russian-occupied land Ukraine would seek in return. ""I don't know, we will see. But all our territories are important, there is no priority,"" he said. Talk of ending Russia'sfull-scale invasionof Ukraine has increased as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20.

He was identified as a Yemeni staff member “arbitrarily detained by local authorities since 23 January,” though the circumstances of his death were not specified. The employee, who WFP said had worked for the UN since 2017, left behind a wife and two children. The United Nations announced the suspension Monday of its activities in Yemen’s Saada region, a Huthi stronghold, after the rebels detained multiple personnel there this year. The Iran-backed Houthi have arrested dozens of staffers from the UN and other humanitarian organizations, most of them since the middle of 2024, as Yemen’s decade-long civil war grinds on. In January alone, the rebels detained eight UN workers, including six in Saada, which adds to the dozens of NGO and UN personnel detained since June. The Houthi claimed the June arrests included “an American-Israeli spy network” operating under the cover of humanitarian organizations — allegations emphatically rejected by the UN Human Rights Office.

The attack, which included strikes on gas infrastructure overnight and continued into the morning, has further strained Ukraine's energy grid. ""At night, Russia attacked gas infrastructure. As of this morning, the energy sector is still under attack,"" Halushchenko said. Russian forces launched a combined missile and drone attack overnight, targeting primarily Poltava Oblast, the Air Force reported.

Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure since the start of its full-scale invasion, aiming to disrupt power supplies and weaken civilian morale.

											— One person was killed and others were injured when a private jet owned by Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil collided with another jet Monday afternoon at the Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, authorities said.Neil’s jet was landing at the airport when it veered off the runway and collided with another parked plane, Neil’s representative Worrick Robinson, IV, said in a statement. There were two pilots and two passengers on Neil’s plane, but he was not among them.“Mr. Neil’s thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting today,” Robinson said.The arriving jet veered off the runway and collided with the Gulfstream 200 jet that was parked on private property, according to Kelli Kuester, aviation planning and outreach coordinator at the Scottsdale Airport. It appeared that the left main landing gear of the arriving jet failed, resulting in the collision, she said.Kuester said four people were on the arriving jet, which had come from Austin, Texas, and one person was in the parked plane. Two people injured in the collision were taken to trauma centers and one was in stable condition at a hospital, Scottsdale Fire Department Capt. Dave Folio said. He said they were working to recover the body of the person killed in the collision.“Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody involved in this,” Folio said.The runway has been closed and will remain closed “for the foreseeable future,” Kuester said.Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowskysaid in a statement that she is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the airport, police and federal agencies.“On behalf of the city of Scottsdale, we offer our deepest condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have been taken to our trauma center for treatment,” she said. “We will keep all affected by this tragedy in our prayers.”The airport is a popular hub for jets coming in and out of the Phoenix area, especially during big sports weekends like the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament, which attracts huge crowds just a few miles away.The Scottsdale collision comes after three major U.S. aviation disasters in the past two weeks. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And last week a small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome, killing all 10 people on board.___Associated Press reporter Gabriel Sandoval in Phoenix contributed.","Plane crash at Scottsdale Airport in Arizona kills 1 person, authorities say","Sejal Govindarao, Hallie Golden",AP News,2025-02-10T23:36:31,2025-02-11T03:11:54,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-koreas-yoon-blames-malicious-opposition-for-martial-law-bid,"SEOUL - South Korea’s suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol blamed the “malicious” opposition for his decision to declare martial law, telling a court on Feb 11 that the opposition’s refusal to applaud him or shake his hand exposed its plans to “destroy” his government. The former prosecutor plunged democratic South Korea into political turmoil when he declared martial law on Dec 3, suspending civilian rule and sending soldiers to Parliament. The attempt lasted only six hours as the opposition-led Parliament defied troops to vote down the declaration, later impeaching him over the move. Mr Yoon was detained in mid-January on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested. He is regularly being transported from prison to hearings at the Constitutional Court, which will determine whether his impeachment is upheld. At the Feb 11 hearing, Mr Yoon complained that the South Korean opposition had failed to offer him due respect while he was in office. “No matter how much they dislike me, it is the basic principle of dialogue and compromise to listen to me and give me a round of applause for my budget speech in Parliament,” the 64-year-old told the court. But, he said, opposition lawmakers “didn’t even enter the main hall, and I had to give a speech to a half-empty Parliament”. Such a gesture, he claimed, was “deeply malicious” and exposed the “opposition’s intent to destroy my government”. He then complained that opposition MPs attending another Parliament address “turned their heads away... and refused to shake hands”. In his martial law declaration, Mr Yoon labelled the opposition “anti-state elements” intent on insurrection, saying the decree was required “to safeguard constitutional order”. The Feb 11 hearing is widely expected to be the last one before the court rules whether to uphold Mr Yoon’s impeachment, a move that would trigger a fresh presidential election within 60 days. Several lawmakers were in attendance at the hearing, an AFP reporter in court saw. Outside, Mr Yoon’s supporters held “Stop the Steal” signs. They have borrowed US President Donald Trump’s rhetoric to support unproven claims that recent South Korean elections – dominated by the opposition – were manipulated by shadowy foreign forces. One protester stood on top of a car, shouting into a microphone for Mr Yoon’s release. Much of Mr Yoon’s impeachment trial has centred on whether he violated the Constitution in declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war. Mr Yoon suggested last week that even if he had ordered the arrest of MPs to prevent them from voting down his decree, it would not legally matter because the order had not been carried out. He is also facing a criminal trial on insurrection charges, for which he faces jail time or the death penalty. AFP JoinST's Telegram channeland get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

""(North Korea) has provided some 11,000 troops, missiles, 200 pieces of long-range artillery and a substantial amount of ammunition and there is the possibility of (the North) additionally supplying troops, weapons and ammunition going forward,"" the ministry said in a briefing to the parliamentary defense committee.

It raised the possibility of the North receiving Russia's technological assistance in exchange for military support, specifically mentioning technologies for nuclear-powered submarines and atmospheric re-entry technology for ICBMs. Regarding the North's relations with the United States, the ministry said Pyongyang appears to be seeking to establish favorable circumstances for talks with Washington through a display of tough rhetoric and provocations.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-841593,"“Hamas is playing for time – and the hostages are their main survival card. Israel must respond decisively. Otherwise, we’ll find ourselves facing endless demands,” Yossi Amrosi, a former senior Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) official, lecturer on current affairs, and author, warned in an interview with	Maariv on Tuesday. Hamas claimed on Monday that Israel failed to meet several agreed-upon terms, including the number of aid trucks and fuel entering Gaza. However, Amrosi dismissed these as false claims. “Even the mediators themselves testify that Israel met all the established conditions – including the careful release of Palestinian terrorists and even the evacuation of the Netzarim corridor, which was one of the IDF’s greatest military achievements in the war.” Beyond the exchange of accusations, a crucial question emerges: why did Hamas choose this moment for such an ultimatum, and what strategic considerations lie behind it? Amrosi outlined several possible motivations, the foremost being Hamas’s growing confidence following recent developments. The organization’s strengthened position stems from various achievements on the ground. “Hamas sees itself as having achieved significant gains – Israel evacuated the Netzarim corridor, thousands of aid trucks are entering Gaza, the Rafah crossing has reopened, and there’s also Iranian backing, which intensified after Hamas leaders’ meetings in Tehran,” Amrosi noted. The move may also serve as a response to former US president Donald Trump’s plan for the US to take over the Gaza Strip. “Until now, Hamas has barely responded to the Palestinian relocation plan presented in the US, but they might now see an opportunity to declare: ‘We’re here, and we’re not going anywhere,’” Amrosi said. Furthermore, Hamas is likely considering Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s perceived reluctance to advance to the next phase of the war. “Hamas understands well the political pressure within Israel and the coalition’s opposition to continuing the war. It estimates Netanyahu won’t proceed to the next phase, so it’s trying to pressure him publicly through the families and the Israeli public,” he said. The strategy also reflects Hamas’s tactical need for time to rebuild and strengthen. “Hamas has a clear interest in extending negotiations as much as possible. For them, time is their most precious resource – and they use every minute to rehabilitate infrastructure, rebuild their forces, gather weapons, and prepare for the next round of fighting,” Amrosi said. Amrosi identified two main options for Israel. The first would be yielding to Hamas’s demands, which he warned would set a dangerous precedent. “The first option is to say, ‘Sorry, Hamas, you’re right,’ and fulfill their demands to advance the deal. This would be a strategic disaster that would lead to more ultimatums in the future.” The second option involves maintaining a firm stance while applying counterpressure. “Israel must clarify that it hasn’t violated any terms of the agreement and activate mediators – especially the US – to pressure Hamas to return to the original agreements. If this doesn’t work, it should present its own ultimatum: if the deal isn’t realized, fighting will resume with greater intensity.” In his concluding remarks, Amrosi emphasized that “Israel has enough tools to apply pressure – and it must use them. Hamas sees the hostages as their most important strategic weapon, and if we don’t make clear there’s a price for this, we’ll find ourselves facing endless delays. Hamas is counting on public pressure in Israel to overcome the government. The question is whether Israel will manage to break this pattern or continue to be dragged along by it.",Shin Bet veteran urges Israel: Don't cave to Hamas' hostage demands,PELED ARBELI,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-11T08:13:00,2025-02-11T08:40:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hostage-release-delay-ceasefire-violations-76d6fd9162160f9554fec37041342714,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Hamas said Monday it will delay the further release of hostages in the Gaza Strip after accusing Israel of violating a fragile ceasefire that now faces its most serious crisis since it began three weeks ago. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under heavy pressure to secure the release of remaining hostages after three Israelis freed Saturday came home emaciated after 16 months in captivity. Yet in a sign of the precarious nature of the truce, the Israeli military said late Monday it had canceled leave for soldiers assigned to Gaza. Hamas’ said its plan to delay the next hostage release “until further notice” depended on whether Israel “abides by its obligations.” The announcement came as Palestinians and the international community seethed over President Donald Trump’s recent comments that Palestinians from Gaza would not have a right to return under his proposal for the U.S. to take over the war-torn territory. In an effort to improve relations with the Trump administration, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday ended a controversial system that paid stipends to the families of Palestinian prisoners, including those convicted in deadly attacks on Israel. The U.S. and Israel have said the so-called “martyrs fund” rewarded violence against Israel. Israel and Hamas are in the midst of a six-week ceasefire during which Hamas has committed to releasing 33 hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The sides have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire’s first phase went into effect on Jan. 19, freeing 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners. The next exchange, scheduled for Saturday, called for three more Israeli hostages to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The war could resume in early March if no agreement is reached on the more complicated second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for the return of all remaining hostages and an indefinite extension of the truce. An Israeli official said Netanyahu was consulting security officials after the Hamas announcement. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Netanyahu also pushed forward a scheduled meeting of his Security Cabinet to Tuesday morning from later in the day. In addition to canceling leave for soldiers in Gaza, the Israeli military also said Monday it was bolstering defensive forces responsible for areas along the border with Gaza. A judge granted Netanyahu’s request to postpone his testimony in an ongoing corruption trial on Tuesday due to the security situation. Defense Minister Israel Katz said Hamas’ plan to delay the next release of hostages was “a complete violation” of the ceasefire agreement and that he instructed the Israeli military to be on the highest level of alert. The prime minister’s coordinator for hostages said the Israeli government intends to live up to its end of the agreement. Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida said on social media that Israel has obstructed key provisions of the ceasefire by not allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, carrying out strikes across the territory and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid. The group later put out a statement calling its planned postponement a “warning signal,” adding that “the door remains open for the exchange to proceed as planned if Israel abides by its obligations.” The group representing many of the families of hostages called on mediating countries to prevent the deal from collapsing. “Recent evidence from those released, as well as the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday, leaves no room for doubt — time is of the essence, and all hostages must be urgently rescued from this horrific situation,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. In Gaza, Palestinians fretted the possibility of the truce falling apart. “People are all afraid. Today, people have begun to stock up on supplies for fear that war will return again,” said Mohammad Yusuf of Khan Younis. “There is no safety, because any defect in the agreement leads to the return of war, and the threat of a return of war.” Trump made his latest comments about Gaza in an interview with FOX News set to air Monday, less than a week after he floated his plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and turn it in “the Riviera of the Middle East.” He has also ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially U.S. allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza, who claim the territory as part of a future homeland. The ceasefire previously hit a snag when an Israeli female civilian held hostage wasn’t released as early as planned, and Israel delayed the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza for two days. Negotiators were able to find a solution, and the hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was eventually released with two other hostages. Under the new system announced by Abbas, the Palestinian president, prisoners’ families will still be eligible for government assistance, but only depending on their financial needs. Previously, payments were determined based on the amount of time a prisoner had spent in prison. The system will also be transferred from the Palestinian government to an outside foundation. There was no immediate reaction from the U.S. or Israel. During Trump’s first term, the U.S. halted assistance to the Palestinian Authority because of the martyr’s fund. Israel has withheld hundreds of millions of dollars of tax transfers to the cash-strapped authority because of the policy. A senior Palestinian official said the Palestinians have informed the Trump administration of the decision and hope the U.S. legislation cutting assistance, known as the Taylor Force Act, will be rescinded and that Israel will unfreeze the transfers. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing internal deliberations. Hamas condemned the Palestinian Authority’s move, calling it “an unpatriotic move that violates one of our core national principles.” ___ Associated Press writer Samy Magdy contributed from Cairo.","Hamas says it will delay the release of more hostages, putting Gaza ceasefire at risk","MELANIE LIDMAN, SAMY MAGDY",AP News,2025-02-10T16:21:12,2025-02-11T04:08:58,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/australia-albanese-trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum-354d8596ec3b37100b5c0fd811c67bcf,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump said he agreed to consider a tariff exemption on Australian steel and aluminum imports after a telephone call on Tuesday with Australia’s prime minister. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese argued for an exemption during the call, which was scheduled before Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday. Trump said the United States trade surplus with Australia was one of the reasons he was considering an exemption from the tariffs. “We actually have a surplus,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about trade with Australia. “It’s one of the only countries which we do. And I told (Albanese) that that’s something that we’ll give great consideration to.” Trump spoke after he removed exceptions and exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%. Trump also hiked his 2018 aluminum tariffs to 25% from 10%. Albanese had told reporters earlier in Canberra he made Australia’s case for an exemption, and that both leaders agreed on wording to say publicly, “which is that the ‘U.S. president agreed that an exemption was under consideration in the interests of both of our countries.’” “They are the words that are agreed. They’re the words that I’ll stick to. And I can say, though, that it was a very positive and constructive discussion,” Albanese added. Australia had an exemption from such tariffs during Trump’s first administration. Australia’s arguments include that the country has run a trade deficit with the U.S. since the mid-20th century and Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S. Australia has only a minor share of the U.S. markets. Albanese on Tuesday also raised the AUKUS agreement with the U.S. and Britain, struck with former President Joe Biden’s administration, in which Australia will acquire a fleet of submarines powered by U.S. nuclear technology. “Our steel and aluminum are both key inputs for the U.S.-Australia defense industries in both of our countries,” Albanese said. Australia announced over the weekend it had made the first of six $500 million payments to the U.S. under AUKUS to boost U.S. submarine building capacity. Trump intends to reset U.S. taxes on all imports to match the same levels charged by other countries, all of which comes on top of the 10% tariffs he has already put on China, China’s retaliatory tariffs that started Monday and the U.S. tariffs planned for Canada and Mexico that have been suspended until March 1. Tuesday’s conversation was Albanese’s second with Trump since the president was elected. Albanese said after the phone call the “relationship is in good shape.”",Trump says he is considering tariff exemptions on Australian steel and aluminum,ROD MCGUIRK,AP News,2025-02-11T00:32:10,2025-02-11T04:42:58,gemini-2.0-flash

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-modi-trump-meet-india-backs-chabahar-port/articleshow/118126924.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the Trump administration threatens to roll back the sanction waiver that allowed India to develop the strategic Chabahar port in Iran, the Indian government Monday strongly backed the port saying it has provided a much-needed alternative route to Afghanistan for its reconstruction and economic development, while boosting trade linkages with Central Asia. The remarks by a senior MEA official follow the US restoration last week of its “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran to deny it all paths to a nuclear weapon and to counter its “malign influence” abroad. It saw US President Donald Trump signing a memorandum that calls upon the Secretary of State to modify or rescind sanction waivers, particularly those that provide Iran “any degree of economic or financial relief, including those related to Iran’s Chabahar port project”. The remarks - at an event to mark the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution of Iran – also came days before PM Narendra Modi’s bilateral meeting with Trump in Washington on Thursday. ""Regional connectivity has been an important pillar of India, Iran relations. The development of the Chabahar port in southeastern Iran reflects our joint vision for connectivity for mutual benefits,"" said MEA secretary (east) Jaideep Mazumdar, while describing the signing of the long-term contract for the development of Chabahar port in May last year as a significant milestone in India-Iran ties. The port has proven its strong potential. It has emerged as the connecting point for the region in delivering deliver humanitarian assistance, especially during the Covid pandemic, added the official, while listing the amount of assistance delivered to Afghanistan through the port. India and Iran had in 2015 signed an MoU to facilitate India’s partnership in developing the port. Last year, the 2 sides signed a contract that will have India equipping and operating the Shahid Beheshti terminal of the port over the next 10 years. The port opens up opportunities for India in trade and commerce with Afghanistan and Central Asia, while providing an alternative and reliable access route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan. As the Indian government maintains, the port’s location in Arabian Sea means it won’t be vulnerable to dangers posed by developments in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz. The previous Trump administration had in 2018 exempted Chabahar from US sanctions, acknowledging its role in facilitating reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. The memorandum also called upon the Secretary of State to modify or rescind existing sanctions waivers and cooperate with the Secretary of Treasury to implement a campaign aimed at driving Iran’s oil exports to zero. India has not been importing crude from Iran for many years now. ""Our economic ties are growing in many fields. Last year, Iran and India signed a long-term agreement to run the Chabahar port, known as the ""golden gateway"" to connect nations along the Indian Ocean with Central Asia and the Caucasus. Cooperation through the International North–South Transport Corridor is another key example of the strong partnership between our countries,"" said Iranian ambassador Iraj Elahi, speaking on the occasion.","Ahead of Modi-Trump meet, India backs Chabahar port",Sachin Parashar,Times Of India,2025-02-11T01:05:00,2025-02-11T01:05:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/france-emmanuel-macron-marine-le-pen-elections-court-national-rally-europe/,"PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has picked one of his closest allies to lead France’s highest constitutional authority, just weeks before it is slated to rule on a case likely to impact Marine Le Pen’s political future. The appointment of Richard Ferrand to serve as president of the Conseil Constitutionnel was announced Monday evening in a short statement that went out as Macron welcomed world leaders and tech moguls for the first day of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris. Ferrand’s selection had been an open secret for several days, has been met with widespread criticism from the president’s political opponents and raised eyebrows among legal and constitutional scholars. Several prominent voices argued that Ferrand’s prestigious appointment could politicize an independent institution at the heart of French democracy, especially as it gets ready to render a decision that could impact the far-right leader’s ability to stand in future elections. Benjamin Morel, a constitutional law professor at one of France’s leading law schools, said Ferrand’s presidency could cast a shadow over the institution’s decision, given his “political weight and his closeness to the head of state.” Le Pen was charged with having participated in a scheme to embezzle European Parliament funds to pay for domestic staff for her party, the National Rally. Prosecutors have asked that the far-right leader, one of the current front-runners for the next presidential election in 2027, be banned from running for public office over the next five years and that the sentence be immediately executed — even if she appeals. Typically in France punishments are suspended until the appeals process has concluded. Le Pen has repeatedly professed her innocence and claimed that her trial was “politicized.” In the weeks to come and in all likelihood before Le Pen’s verdict date, set for March 31, the Conseil Constitutionnel will, in relation to a separate case, rule on whether enforcing an ineligibility ruling before a defendant has exhausted their appeals undermines the constitutionally guaranteed right of voters to freely choose their representatives.  “If Ferrand announces a decision which in any way affects Le Pen’s ability to run in the next election, there’s a risk it will be perceived as a disguised coup,” Morel added. One of Macron’s BFFs The role of the Conseil Constitutionnel is similar to constitutional courts in other countries. It reviews legislation, oversees elections and rules on constitutional challenges. But unlike Germany’s BVerfG or the United States’ Supreme Court, you don’t need to be a trained judge or lawyer to be appointed. Ferrand isn’t a judge, but the former head of the French National Assembly and one of Macron’s earliest supporters.  Like Ferrand, both the outgoing president of the Conseil Constitutionnel, Laurent Fabius, and his predecessor Jean-Louis Debré, had previously presided over the National Assembly. Fabius and Debré were both politically aligned with the presidents who appointed them as well. But Debré was appointed by former President Jacques Chirac when he was just weeks away from leaving office and thus didn’t stand to benefit from Debré’s new role. Fabius, meanwhile, had not historically been close to the president who appointed him, François Hollande. Constitutional experts like Morel believe Ferrand’s ties to the president are much more worrying than those who had the job before him, and they have pointed to a legal principle according to which institutions, particularly courts, must not only be impartial but also appear impartial to the public. Writing in Le Figaro, the Conseil’s former secretary-general, Jean-Éric Schoettl, said that its leader “must be beyond any suspicion of partisanship, favoritism, or personal ties.” Macron’s political opponents have seized on the controversy. Member of the European Parliament Marion Maréchal, Le Pen’s niece and a National Rally ally, said in an interview on RTL Ferrand’s appointment was an attempt to hinder Le Pen’s capacity to lead reforms if she is elected president. The Democratic and Republican group in the National Assembly — made up of communist lawmakers and representatives from France’s territories outside Europe — said it would reintroduce a bill to require all members of the Conseil Constitutionnel to have legal experience and skills and not have been in government or parliament in the decade preceding their appointment. A change to the system is backed by many French legal scholars, said Julien Bonnet, a constitutional law professor at the University of Montpellier and head of the French Constitutional Law Association.   “With the current appointment system, a decision can be perfectly sound from a legal perspective, but read as being political by public opinion or media,” Bonnet said.

https://www.politico.eu/article/moldova-russia-backed-breakaway-region-strikes-deal-end-energy-crisis-transnistria/,"Moldova has reached a deal with its Russian-backed breakaway Transnistria region to get gas flowing again after Moscow cut off supplies last month, having left hundreds of thousands of people without heating or water. In a statement Monday, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said Transnistria had declined €60 million in European Union funds to help with fuel deliveries and instead brokered a deal with a Hungarian firm. Transnistrian authorities claimed it will be underpinned by ""Russian credit."" ""Under Moscow’s pressure, [Transnistria's de facto capital] Tiraspol refused €60 million in EU aid that could have ended energy blackmail,"" Recean wrote online. A senior Moldovan government official confirmed the details to POLITICO. ""Russia blocked the EU-proposed solution for the Transnistrian region"" over fears of losing its hold over the unrecognized state,"" added the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the arrangement. Moscow has historically provided free gas to the separatist authorities, allowing them to fund pensions and soldiers' salaries through energy sales. However, a plan to secure alternatives with the support of the EU would have meant tariffs gradually increasing and integration with the continent's energy markets. ""If the Transnistrian region moves toward market prices, it weakens Russia's grip — eliminating the need for subsidized energy and eroding Moscow’s economic leverage in the region,"" the official said. ""By obstructing this transition, Russia is protecting its most powerful tools of influence."" The humanitarian crisis began at the start of the year when Moscow ended gas flows to the area over a dispute with the Moldovan government. Documents obtained by POLITICO showed local leaders rejected offers of alternative supplies. Moldovan officials have repeatedly warned the standoff was designed to destabilize the EU candidate country ahead of parliamentary elections this year. The Kremlin was also accused of trying to bribe voters against supporting European integration in a 2024 EU referendum.",Moldova’s Russia-backed breakaway region strikes deal to end energy crisis,Gabriel Gavin,POLITICO,2025-02-10T11:25:47,2025-02-10T11:27:07,gemini-2.0-flash

""The army and people of [North Korea] will invariably support and encourage the just cause of the Russian Army and people to defend their sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity in keeping with the spirit of the treaty on the comprehensive strategic partnership between [North Korea] and Russia,"" Kim was quoted by state media as saying. Western leaders and Ukrainian officials say North Korea has since last fall sent an estimated 11,000 troops to fight alongside of Kremlin troops, mainly in the Russian region of Kursk. Their current status is uncertain, with some intelligence sources saying many of the troops have been rotated out of the front lines after sufferinghorrific lossesin fighting against Ukrainian forces. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 8 said Russia's ""cooperation with North Korea will continue to expand."" Zelenskyy has publicly accused Russia and North Korea of trying to cover up evidence of the deployments by issuing fake papers to North Korean soldiers identifying them as Russian citizens. The Kremlin and Pyongyang have not commented directly on the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia or the reported high losses. Kim, speaking at the Defense Ministry to mark the countryâ	ms Army Day, also threatened to build up his nuclear forces and use other ""countermeasures"" as he blasted the military cooperation between the United States, South Korea, and Japan. Pyongyang ""does not want unnecessary tension of the regional situation but will take sustained countermeasures to ensure the regional military balance,"" Kim said. Kim said U.S. involvement in the region -- including deployment of nuclear assets, war maneuvers, and ties to the Japanese and South Korean militaries -- would lead to a military imbalance in the region and endanger the security situation, state-run KCNA reported.

https://www.rferl.org/a/kosovo-elections-albin-kurti-serbia/33307113.html,"For Kosovo, the February 9 parliamentary elections are about much more than just choosing a new government; they will shape the country’s diplomatic future, regional stability, and international standing. And, according to experts in the United States and the EU, the stakes are high -- without alignment with its international allies, Kosovo risks not only diplomatic friction but also potential isolation or even a frozen conflict. Kosovo's relations with Washington and Brussels are centered around the EU-facilitated dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo, which began in 2011 and aims to normalize relations between the two countries. Kurti Takes A Hard Line Since Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence, which Serbia still rejects, there have been ongoing tensions between the two countries. These tensions primarily revolve around ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo, who reject Pristina's authority and have tried to maintain parallel governance structures with Belgrade's support. Analysis: Kosovo Further Alienates Minority Serbs, Straining Status As 'Reliable Partner' Over the past 2 1 years, the government of Prime Minister Albin Kurti -- which is likely to win reelection -- has taken a hard line, replacing Serbian license plates with Kosovar ones, stopping the import of the Serbian currency to Kosovo, and closing Serbian banks and dozens of parallel institutions. Kurti's moves have been criticized by the previous U.S. administration and the EU, who argued that they were not coordinated with Kosovo's international partners and have made life harder for the country's ethnic Serbs. Richard Grenell, who served as special envoy for the Serbia and Kosovo talks in U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration, wrote on Xthat the ""Kurti Government was not trustworthy during Trump's first term, nor during Biden's term."" According to Grenell, both ""Republicans and Democrats have criticized Kurti consistently for taking unilateral actions that destabilize the region."" Richard Grenell (file photo) Kurti, however, has stuck to his guns, even when warned by the United States or when, in June 2023, the EU suspended financial aid to the country worth up to 100 million euros ($104 million). The moves against Kosovo's ethnic Serb community, Kurti has said, were necessary steps aimed at extending the rule of law in the north of the country, where most of Kosovo's ethnic Serbs live, and in line with the country's constitution. Moreover, on February 2, he said that no Kosovar government has had better relations with the United States than his own. Kosovo Village Celebrates Trump's Inauguration Kosovo’s elections will also shape its relationship with the EU, which is closely tied to its diplomatic stance toward Serbia. Kosovo’s EU application, which was submitted in December 2022, has been stalled ever since, as it needs a consensus of support among the 27 members of the EU. The biggest hurdle is the five EU countries -- Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain -- that do not recognize Kosovo's independence. Toby Vogel, a Western Balkans analyst at the Berlin-based Democratization Policy Council, told RFE that Kosovo's next government will need to work more diligently to improve relations with the EU. There is also the question of Kosovo's membership in international organizations, such as Interpol or the Council of Europe. While the EU has promised backing for Pristina to join these bodies, Serbian efforts to counteract have always succeeded. Will Kurti Change? Kurti's ruling Self-Determination Movement (LVV) is currently the favorite to win the elections, although most polls are predicting the party won't reach the 50 percent needed to form a government on its own. And, so far, Kurti has shown little sign that he is ready to change his policy toward Serbia and the West. The Kosovar government has continued to take a hard line by continuing to close institutions in the country tied to Serbia. And Kurti has signaled that, if he wins a new mandate as prime minister, he will continue to strengthen his image as an uncompromising leader who prioritizes principle over diplomacy. Kosovo Raids Parallel Serb Institutions Amid Simmering Ethnic Tensions ""The Republic of Kosovo, with our government in charge, will never say yes to the 'Association,'"" Kurti said at a rally with supporters in South Mitrovica on February 1. The association Kurti was referring is the Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities in Kosovo, which was part of an agreement Kosovo reached with Serbia in 2013 but has never been implemented. A huge sticking point between Serbia and Kosovo, the association is intended to coordinate Serb-majority municipalities in areas such as education, health care, and economic development. If Kurti wins and sticks to his guns, it could mean Kosovo is more isolated than ever. This, Vogel suggested, could mean occasional violence or a frozen conflict, ""like the one that's developed in Cyprus...over the years."" ""That would be a real problem for Kosovo,"" he said, ""because that would make it impossible for the country to move on."" Opposition Win Could Bring Significant Change There is also the possibility that Kurti would lose. If the LVV receives less than 50 percent but still receives the most votes, Kurti could try to form a coalition government. If he isn't successful, then the second-placed party would have a mandate to form a government. An opposition coalition could drastically redefine Kosovo's relations with the West -- and potentially reset peace talks with Serbia. Kurti's opponents for the prime minister's post have advocated repairing and deepening relations with the United States, which they argue, are essential for Kosovo’s future. Charles Kupchan, from the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, said that whoever forms the next government in Kosovo must ensure that relations with Washington remain strong and intact. Kosovo, he said, cannot afford to be at odds with its allies. ""I would say, if you want a good relationship with the United States, make deals, get into the bazaar, be ready to negotiate,"" Kupchan said. ""And I think that actions that are seen as causing difficulty will not go over well in Washington. Actions that are seen [as] advancing the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia will be greeted warmly in Washington.""",Why Kosovo's Election Matters For The Region And The World,"Valona Tela, Rikard Jozwiak",RFE/RL,2025-02-08T18:03:22,2025-02-09T08:31:43,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.rferl.org/a/scholz-merz-germany-elections-taurus-russia-ukraine/33309168.html,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz again ruled out sending long-range Taurus missilesto Ukraine, opposing actions that would ""deliver destructive weapons"" deep inside of Russia, and hitting out at his conservative political rival, who has expressed more openness to delivering such weapons to Kyiv. ""I do not think it is right to deliver destructive weapons deep into the Russian hinterland,"" Scholz said on February 9 during a 90-minute televised debate ahead of national elections in two weeks. ""That is, I believe, exactly the kind of step not to make if you carry responsibility for Germany,"" he added. Friedrich Merz, whose conservative CDU alliance is leading in the polls against Scholzâ	ms center-left SPD, said he has ""always been very clear"" regarding his position on sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine. ""I have always said the delivery of cruise missiles must be decided in the European Union. The United States delivers, France delivers, Britain delivers; we should also have delivered,"" Merz said. Merz told German media in October that he would approve delivery to Kyiv of the missiles -- which have a range of some 500 kilometers -- under certain conditions. If Russian strikes on Ukraine ""don't stop, then the first step is this: Lift the range restriction [on current Ukraine missile launchings]. And the second step is that we deliver the Taurus,"" he said. That way, he added, Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has it in his hands how far he wants to escalate this war further."" Germany's DW reported in July that Merz spoke in favor of Berlin aiding Kyiv to protect against Russian aggression and supply it with combat aircraft. ""I believe that we should help Ukraine at least restore sovereignty over its own airspace,"" he wasquoted as saying. Although Scholz has been reluctant to send Kyiv heavy weaponry, Berlin trails only Washington in the amount of support provided to Ukraine.Scholz has insistedthat it is essential to secure the ""sovereignty of Ukraine and [ensure] that it will not be forced to submit to a dictated peace."" In November,Scholz attackedthe final declaration of theG20 summitin Rio de Janeiro for not plainly stating that Russia was responsible for the war in Ukraine, even as he restated his opposition to sending long-range missiles to Kyiv. ""In my view, supplying cruise missiles would be a mistake for many reasons,"" he said at the time -- including the danger that it would bring Germany closer to direct conflict with Russia. Domestically, Scholz, seeking a bounce-back in the polls ahead of the February 23 election, accused Merz of seeking support from the far-right Alternative for Deutschland (Germany) or AfD, which would break the taboo against the mainstream parties in the country cooperating with the party. Following World War II, Germany has done ""very well in the past decades when the democratic parties agreed not to cooperate with the extreme right,"" Scholz said. Merz underlined that his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Bavarian CSU allies would not cooperate or rule with the virulently anti-immigration AfD. ""I want to make it clear here once again that we will not do that,"" Merz said. â	œThere are no similarities between the AfD and the [CDU]."" The CDU alliance, which is polling at about 30 percent, has itself pressed for tougher immigration policies in an effort to draw voters away from the AfD, which is polling at around 20 percent. Scholz said Merz's proposal to reject all migrants at Germany's borders ""contradicts European law."" Scholzâ	ms Social Democrats and the Greens each are at around 15-18 percent support ahead of the vote for the next parliament, or Bundestag. ING bank analyst Carsten Brzeski wrote that the debate likely ended in a draw and -- though heated at times -- was relatively ""well-behaved,"" which could leave open the possibility of a ""grand coalition"" involving the CDU and other groups in an effort to shut out the AfD, which has been accused of having ties to Russia. Initial public opinion polls also scored the two politicians' performances in the debate as roughly equal. Scholz and Merz are scheduled to meet again in a head-to-head debate on February 19. They are also scheduled meet in a four-way debate on February 16 with AfD's Alice Weidel and Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck from the Greens.

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-commission-expanding-definition-defense-spending/,"BRUSSELS — European Union governments will be able to increase military spending without falling foul of the bloc’s budget rules under plans to expand what can be classed as defense investment. The costs of military staffing and equipment maintenance — which currently count toward a country’s deficit figures that are strictly policed by the European Commission — could be considered alongside core defense spending, four officials, three from national governments and one from the EU, told POLITICO. Europe is desperately searching for ways to fund its defense needs as the war in Ukraine enters its fourth year and United States President Donald Trump demands the hiking of defense spending to 5 percent of gross domestic product. The EU’s spending rules aim to keep national budget deficits — the amount governments spend relative to what they bring in — at less than 3 percent of the size of the economy and public debt at no more than 60 percent.But countries can be granted more time to get to these levels if they invest in defense. They can also escape a punitive measure — known as an excessive deficit procedure — if their extra spending is related to defense. The proposed broader definition — which is still just one option under consideration — would be a gift for countries with overstretched budgets, such as Italy with its debt mountain or eternally overspending France; and governments like Poland, which is under Commission monitoring for an excessive deficit despite spending heavily on defense. The plan is to include in the definition “all increased investment like manpower or maintenance of new equipment — not only purchases of equipment,” said one of the officials who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to talk about confidential discussions. Expanding the definition of defense spending is the second piece of the “extraordinary measures” to boost the bloc’s military capacity that Commission President Ursula von der Leyen floated in her meeting with EU leaders on Monday, as POLITICO revealed. The first was an emergency clause that countries could trigger in the case of events beyond their control, which would allow them to deviate from previously agreed fiscal paths. Fiscally conservative states led by Germany opposed this option during a meeting of EU treasury chiefs last week. There are lingering concerns, however, that merely expanding the definition of defense won’t be enough for highly indebted government such as Italy, Spain and France to increase their defense budget without making cuts elsewhere. A decision on the options under consideration should be made relatively soon, according to the EU official. Creative solutions In light of past financial crises, the Commission sees its reformed fiscal rules — which entered into force just one year ago, but have been labeled as too strict by countries such as Italy and Poland — as sacrosanct. But it is also trying to find creative solutions to allow for more flexibility.  Officials from European finance ministries have been working with the Commission’s economic department on the issue for some time, several EU diplomats told POLITICO.  The unexpected move from von der Leyen last Monday has accelerated that ongoing work. However, while the proposal risks triggering a debate on what kind of defense investment the bloc needs, it is also seen as one of the few viable options to dovetail the EU’s targets. A senior EU diplomat said it is a way to give “relief” to other countries in light of Germany’s resistance to more creative roads to increase EU defense spending, referring to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s opposition to issuing eurobonds for defense. Eastern and Southern European countries, plus France, “can work” to support changes the Commission is considering, the diplomat said. “Eastern countries stress how preparedness is important, and that means expenses for transporting troops and being ready for military mobilization.” UPDATED: This article has been updated to clarify the timing of the EU treasury chiefs' meeting.",EU considers giving countries wiggle room to boost defense spending,"Giovanna Faggionato, Gregorio Sorgi",POLITICO,2025-02-10T03:27:42Z,2025-02-12T12:45:12Z,gemini-2.0-flash

Cho will participate in the 61st Munich Security Conference, set for Friday through Sunday, during which he is ""expected to discuss the Russia-North Korea military cooperation and the security links between the Indo-Pacific and Europe, including the ongoing war in Ukraine,"" a foreign ministry official said. It will mark Cho's first overseas trip since the political turmoil in South Korea triggered by now impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law attempt in December last year.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-841347,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene the Israeli security cabinet on Tuesday to discuss the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal after an Israeli delegation arrived in Qatar on Sunday for more Gaza truce talks. The cabinet meeting was scheduled following criticism from the Israeli public and opposition figures over it not being carried out earlier despite the ceasefire agreement explicitly stating that talks between Israel and Hamas would begin on the ceasefire’s 16th day.“The security cabinet is scheduled for Tuesday – because they have time,” opposition head and Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid wrote on X “We saw the hostages on Saturday. They are dying there of hunger and cold, but this government has no urgency and does not care.”Many officials believe that reaching an agreement on phase two with Hamas could be more difficult to achieve than phase one, noting that Netanyahu had previously stated he would refuse Hamas’s demand for a full stop to the war during the second phase.US President Donald Trump said last week that he supports the destruction of Hamas, which “doesn’t make things easier,” an official told the Jerusalem Post.Washington, Qatar, and Egypt mediated the ceasefire, which has largely held. In keeping with the deal, on Sunday, the IDF completed its withdrawal from its remaining positions in the Netzarim Corridor, which bisects Gaza.Israeli delegation arrives in DohaAn Israeli delegation arrived in Doha on Sunday for talks with mediators. However, the delegation's mandate over the deal will be extremely limited, said one Israeli official. The delegation, which includes Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch, as well as a senior Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) official, referred to as “M,” will only discuss the current phase of the hostage deal and will not negotiate over the second phase.Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, announced “the beginning of the phase two talks” after meeting Netanyahu and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani at Mar-a-Lago last week.According to Israeli and other senior officials who recently met with Witkoff, the impression is that despite the hurdles faced by the relevant parties, the Trump administration is still intent on moving forward with phase two of the Gaza deal.President Isaac Herzog said on Sunday that Trump was set to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and possibly Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, although he gave no dates for the talks.The comments, delivered in an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, came in response to a question about Trump’s recently unveiled proposal to take over and redevelop the Gaza Strip.Herzog did not say when or where the meetings would take place, nor did he discuss their potential content. He also noted that Trump is due to meet with Jordan’s King Abdullah in the coming days, which Jordan’s state news agency has already reported.“President Trump is due to meet with major, major Arab leaders, first and foremost the king of Jordan and the president of Egypt, and I think also the crown prince of Saudi Arabia as well,” Herzog said.“These are partners that must be listened to; they must be discussed with. We have to honor their feelings as well and see how we build a plan that is sustainable for the future,” Herzog said.Saudi Arabia has flatly rejected Trump’s Gaza plan, as have many world leaders. Jordan’s King Abdullah plans to tell Trump during their planned February 11 meeting in Washington that the proposal is a recipe for radicalism that will spread chaos through the Middle East and jeopardize the kingdom’s peace with Israel, Reuters reported earlier this week.","Netanyahu, security cabinet to discuss second phase of Gaza hostage deal",AMICHAI STEIN,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-09T13:51:31,2025-02-09T16:55:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/europe-can-act-within-an-hour-if-us-levies-tariffs-germanys-scholz,"BERLIN – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Feb 10 labelled as “a scandal” US President Donald Trump’s plans for the war-ravaged Palestinian territory of Gaza. Mr Trump sparked global outrage by suggesting on Feb 4 that Washington should take control of the Gaza Strip, clear out its inhabitants and turn it into “the Riviera of the Middle East”. Mr Scholz, speaking in a pre-election TV debate, branded the plan “a scandal” and said “the relocation of a population is unacceptable and against international law”. His conservative election rival Friedrich Merz said: “I share this assessment.” But Mr Merz added that Mr Trump’s announcement is “part of a whole series of proposals coming from the American government”. “We have to wait and see what is really meant seriously and how it will be implemented. There is probably a lot of rhetoric involved.” Israel launched a devastating military offensive against Hamas in Gaza in response to the Palestinian militant group’s Oct 7, 2023, attack which began the war. That conflict has devastated much of the Gaza Strip – a narrow coastal territory on the eastern Mediterranean – but a ceasefire since January has brought a halt to the deadly conflict and provides for the release of hostages seized by Hamas.

https://www.politico.eu/article/the-15-days-that-upended-emmanuel-macron-vision-for-european-ai/,"PARIS — The conversation around the table was free-flowing but anxious. It was mid-January, and the cream of France’s tech industry was lunching with Emmanuel Macron in the elegant Salon des Ambassadeurs at the Elysée Palace. Mistral boss Arthur Mensch, Helsing chief Antoine Bordes and billionaire entrepreneur Xavier Niel were all there. As some of the attendees struggled with the cutlery and French dining etiquette, the tech bros all had one message for the French president: The battle to become the world’s leader in artificial intelligence was raging and Europe risked losing out. Little did they know how prescient their warning would prove. A week later, U.S. President Donald Trump upended the tech industry with his Stargate plan, a staggering $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure. The Jan. 21 announcement sent shockwaves through Paris and across the continent. “It knocked everyone out ... You felt suddenly a gloominess descend, with people saying we’ll never be able to raise so much money,” said Laure de Roucy-Rochegonde, an AI expert with the Paris-based IFRI think tank. It was felt then that the U.S. was about to annihilate the competition. Even if American investors failed to raise the full $500 billion, even a fifth of that sum dwarfed anything Europe could aspire to spend. Macron’s pet project, the AI Action Summit in Paris, was less than a month away and risked coming off like a two-bit side event. Its goals — to push for sustainability and inclusivity — now appeared almost quaint. But by the weekend, another groundbreaking moment had whiplashed the tech world. Chinese startup DeepSeek reported that its cutting-edge chatbot had been built at a fraction of the cost of competitors like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, sending investors scrambling and reviving hopes that the global AI race wouldn’t simply be won by whoever was willing to spend the most. “[The U.S.] use brute force with lots of resources, graphic processing units and data centers ... but the Chinese did better. In the end that’s how innovation works, first someone storms the fortress with sheer force, then someone else enters by a back door,” said Justin Vaïsse, head of the Paris Peace Forum, the nonprofit that helped organize the AI summit in Paris. “It’s just a shame it wasn’t the Europeans who found that back door,” he added. Europe first Macron’s international summit, which begins Monday and will draw high-level envoys like U.S. Vice President JD Vance, India’s Narendra Modi and Ding Xuexiang, the Chinese vice-prime minister, was initially billed as an opportunity to push for more accessible AI technology. “As often with big upheavals, we missed the turning point. That’s what happened with robotization and social networks,” said an aide to the French president, who, like others quoted in this story, was granted anonymity for protocol reasons. The aide said that France must respond by securing “the place of France and Europe” in the new world of AI. The late-January emotional rollercoaster preceding the summit put Paris into fight mode. Now the event is more about showcasing what Europe can do and supporting the continent’s burgeoning AI sector. The summit has since become, in the words of one European official, “a Cannes festival” of the continent’s startups. It’s also an opportunity to get European investors to support their local AI companies, Macron said last week during a videoconference alongside the European Union’s technology sovereignty commissioner, Henna Virkkunen. The president’s message was one of “European preference,” said a French government official. “We are not going to control what companies do, but European patriotism is at stake.” Incentives to “buy European,” a data bank with preferential rates for local companies, and more EU grants are some of the ideas being bounced around in the French capital to save the continent’s AI industry. But that’s just the type of initiative that will have industry veterans rolling their eyes. Chinese startup DeepSeek reported that its cutting-edge chatbot was built at a fraction of the cost of competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT. | Mladen Antonov Images “This is what France does every time there’s a new technology,” said Michael Jackson, an American tech investor who lives in Paris, noting the demise of European champions such as the Qwant search engine and Gaia-X cloud computing. A wakeup call For Emmanuel Macron, artificial intelligence and technology on the whole have long been  strategic domains. The French president promised to create “a startup nation” when he was elected in 2017, and soon ordered an AI action plan from Fields Medal Winner Cédric Villani. Macron has also long championed Mistral, the crown jewel of the French AI industry, one of the few companies on the continent that develops the technology behind conversational chatbots. Macron secured a win on Thursday when the United Arab Emirates agreed to spend more than €30 billion in France to build a 1 gigawatt data center in France. One of Macron's advisers called the investment “proof of France’s attractiveness.",The 15 days that upended Macron’s vision for European AI,Clea Caulcutt,POLITICO,2025-02-06T05:00:00Z,2025-02-07T13:07:49Z,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/australia-close-to-breaking-china-s-critical-mineral-stranglehold-20250205-p5l9ox.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_business,"Australian firms are edging closer to breaking China’s production stranglehold on the rare minerals used in the world’s critical defence systems, electric vehicles and clean energy transition. Companies like Iluka Resources, Lynas Rare Earths, and several lithium miners are already refining, or close to producing, the minerals needed for the batteries, electric circuitry and high-strength magnets that underpin the globe’s green energy transition. Light rare earth oxides, such as neodymium and praseodymium, are used in aircraft engines, electronics, wind turbines and electric vehicles. Heavy rare earths, like the dysprosium and terbium over which China has a stranglehold, are a crucial element in the permanent high-strength magnets used in robotics, defence technology and ocean wind turbines, where they require little maintenance to generate electricity far from the coastline. The minerals refined by Australian companies are now a strategic asset as America swings sharply towards a more transactional trade stance under US President Donald Trump, and Beijing counters US tariffs by clamping down on supply of scarce metals. If Australia is dragged into a trade war with the US and China, “heavy rare earths could serve as a bargaining chip,” said Neha Mukherjee, a senior analyst in rare earths at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Within hours of Trump imposing a 10 per cent tariff on China last week, Beijing introduced export controls on a raft of key minerals such as tungsten, tellurium, molybdenum, bismuth and indium that are critical to a range of high-tech goods. China’s Commerce Ministry said the controls were to “safeguard national security interests.” The clampdown exposes a fault line running through the global economy. China has invested heavily for decades in refining production of critical minerals and rare earths and accounts for 90 per cent of all rare earth oxides used in global manufacturing, effectively controlling all supply of key heavy rare earths. Governments around the world are scrambling to secure supplies of the key minerals as a result. “Rare earths are among very few metals where China has demonstrated a preparedness to withhold supply to achieve unrelated political or other objectives. We’ve also seen China previously implement restrictions on the export of rare earth processing technology,” Iluka managing director Tom O’Leary said. “We’ve all seen the perils of concentrated supply chain over the last several years, and so there’s much greater awareness now of the importance of security of supply,” O’Leary said. Iluka is building a fully integrated rare earths refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia with the help of a $1.65 billion federal government loan. Within a decade of firing up the plant in 2027, it will account for 10 per cent of the world’s rare earth oxide supply and refine more than a third of the globe’s strategically important heavy rare earth oxides, the company says. Meanwhile, ASX-listed Lynas – valued at $6.5 billion – late last year turned on production at its newly built $800 million mixed rare-earth processing plant in Kalgoorlie. It will ship the carbonate output from Kalgoorlie for further refining in Malaysia where it operates the world’s largest single rare earths processing plant producing separated rare earths for export. Lynas is also building a heavy rare earths refinery in Texas, backed by $384 million in Defence Department funding from the Biden administration, in a bid to accelerate America’s access to supplies of rare earths. Another Benchmark analyst, Cameron Perks, said if the US-China trade war escalates, combined with new tariffs and export controls, it’s going to have a significant impact on the critical minerals sector as a whole. “We’re seeing critical minerals being used more and more as bargaining chips in trade negotiations, with countries leveraging their control over supply chains to get a better deal,” Perks said. “Clients in South Korea and Japan have been reaching out to Australia a lot lately, wanting insights on supply, demand, pricing, and cost curves as they try to figure out the impact of Trump’s policies. They’re trying to figure out if this is an opportunity or if they should be backing out,” he said. Australia’s current heavy rare earth output accounts for just 1 per cent of global mined production, Mukherjee said. But it’s projected to jump significantly, reaching 14 per cent by 2029 – the fastest growth outside of China. Ramping up refining capacity is costly, technically challenging and time-consuming. Few have gained the foothold required to compete with China, even on more basic materials like lithium. ASX-listed IGO began producing battery-grade lithium hydroxide with joint venture partner China’s Tianqi Lithium from its Kwinana Refinery in Western Australia in 2022, only to shutter parts of the operation in January this year as sluggish demand for electric vehicles and slumping prices slowed sales and created a global stockpile of the white battery metal.",Australia close to breaking China’s critical mineral stranglehold,Simon Johanson,The Sydney Morning Herald,2025-02-09T01:00:00,2025-02-09T01:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx859nq9jwo,"The first president of independent Namibia, Sam Nujoma, has died at the age of 95 in the capital Windhoek, the country's current leader has announced. Nujoma led the long fight for independence from South Africa in 1990 after helping found Namibia's liberation movement known as the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) in the 1960s. After independence, Nujoma became president in 1990 and led the country until 2005. Nujoma had been hospitalised over the past three weeks with an illness from which he ""could not recover"", Namibian President Nangolo Mbumba said in a statement announcing the death with ""utmost sorrow and sadness"". He ""inspired us to rise to our feet and to become masters of this vast land of our ancestors,"" President Mbumba said. He added: ""Our founding father lived a long and consequential life during which he exceptionally served the people of his beloved country."" King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla had been ""profoundly saddened"" to learn of Nujoma's death. In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, the King paid tribute to Nujoma's ""lifelong commitment to freedom and democracy"" and ""immense"" contribution to history. Nujoma retired as head of state in 2005, but continued to lead the party before stepping down in 2007 as president of the ruling Swapo party after 47 years at the helm. Many Namibians have reacted to his death with sadness, fondly remembering him as ""father of the nation"", says the BBC's Frauke Jensen in Namibia's capital, Windhoek. A teary-eyed Mbumba visited Nujoma's home to offer condolences to his family, including his wife Kovambo Theopoldine Katjimune, 91. Nujoma is widely credited for ensuring peace and stability after independence from South Africa, which was then under white-minority rule, in 1990. Nujoma's policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other sectors of the economy. He also championed the rights of women and children, including making fathers pay for the maintenance of children born out of wedlock. Namibia's Vice-President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who is due to be inaugurated as president in March after leading Swapo to victory in elections, said his ""visionary leadership and dedication to liberation and nation-building laid the foundation for our free, united nation"". African leaders have joined in paying tribute, with African Union Commission chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat describing Nujoma as ""the epitome of courage, never wavering from his vision for a free Namibia and a unified Africa"". South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said the former Namibian president was an ""extraordinary freedom fighter"" who played a leading role in not only his country's fight against colonialism, but also in the campaign that led to white-minority rule ending in South Africa in 1994. ""President Nujoma's leadership of a free Namibia laid the foundation for the solidarity and partnership our two countries share today - a partnership we will continue to deepen as neighbours and friends,"" Ramaphosa added. Kenya's President William Ruto said Nujoma was a ""visionary leader who dedicated his life to the liberation and development of his country"".

https://www.npr.org/2025/02/09/g-s1-47467/egypt-emergency-arab-summit,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Egypt announced Sunday it would host a summit of Arab leaders later in the month, amid alarm in the region over President Trump's proposals regarding the future of Gaza. A statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry says the summit is being called in response to a Palestinian request. It said the leaders will gather on Feb. 27 to discuss ""the new and dangerous developments in the Palestinian issue."" Also Sunday, Israeli forces began withdrawing from the Netzarim corridor in Gaza, in the latest stage of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The Netzarim corridor is a four mile strip of land bisecting northern and southern Gaza that Israel fortified during the war, using it as a military zone. Last month, as part of the ceasefire deal, Israel started allowing Palestinians to cross the Netzarim corridor and return to their homes in the North. The withdrawal is part of the six week first phase of the ceasefire, in which Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, while allowing aid to Gaza. In the next stage of the ceasefire, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and ""sustainable calm."" But negotiations are ongoing on the details. Israel wants Hamas' military and political capabilities eliminated, while Hamas wants all Israeli troops removed from Gaza. Egypt's announcement of a summit comes less than a week after many Arab states rejected Trump's recent comments about relocating Gaza's residents and creating a ""Riviera of the Middle East"" there, as have Palestinian leaders. Trump made the proposal Tuesday when he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington D.C. Speaking to reporters at the White House Friday, Trump said he viewed the proposal as ""a real estate transaction, where we'll be an investor in that part of the world."" He added that he was in ""no rush to do anything."" Several countries also condemned a suggestion by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — that Saudi Arabia has enough land for a Palestinian state. Netanyahu appeared to be joking in response to a slip by an Israeli TV interviewer, but his words reverberated through the region at a time when tensions are running high. Also on Sunday, there were emotional scenes in Bangkok airport, as five Thai workers who were released after being held hostage for over a year in Gaza arrived back home. ""We are all very grateful and very happy that we get to return to our homeland. We all would really like to thank you. I don't know what else to say,"" one of the Thai hostages, Pongsak Thaenna, told a news conference at the airport. The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' attack that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage, has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians according to local health authorities. In recent days, violence in the West Bank has intensified. On Sunday morning, the Palestinian Health Ministry said a 23-year-old Palestinian woman, who was eight months pregnant, was fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the Nur Shams urban refugee camp in northern occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said in a statement that it is investigating the incident.",Egypt to host Gaza summit as Israel withdraws troops from Netzarim Corridor,"Jerome Socolovsky, Robbie Griffiths",NPR,2025-02-09T06:13:44,2025-02-09T06:13:44,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250209000700315,"SEOUL, Feb. 9 (Yonhap) -- Thousands of North Korean laborers have been sent to work in Russia last year, South Korea's spy agency said Sunday, in apparent violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang. The North is believed to have dispatched thousands of laborers to various construction sites across Russia last year, according to the National Intelligence Service (NIS), amid workforce shortages in Russia due to its ongoing war with Ukraine. Under U.N. Security Council resolutions in response to North Korea's weapons tests, the country is banned from sending its nationals to work overseas, and all North Korean workers were required to return to their home country by December 2019. North Korea and Russia are suspected of using student visas for the dispatch of North Korean workers. Last year, 13,221 North Koreans entered Russia, up about 12 times from the previous year, Radio Free Asia recently reported, citing data from Russia's federal statistics service. Among those who entered Russia last year, 7,887 of them said their visit was for education purposes. The move comes amid North Korea's continued support for Russia's war efforts against Ukraine. The North is estimated to have dispatched some 11,000 troops to Russia's western front-line region of Kursk to fight Ukrainian forces, according to South Korean officials. yunhwanchae@yna.co.kr(END)",Thousands of N.K. laborers sent to work in Russia in 2024: S.

https://apnews.com/article/alaska-plane-crash-10-dead-9ebe8b2f0b69c6b6cda7d284fbfc35cd,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The remains of all 10 people killed when their small plane crashed into ice on the Bering Sea have been recovered, authorities said. The Nome Volunteer Fire Department made the announcement on its Facebook page Saturday afternoon. Recovery crews had been racing to recover the bodies before a winter storm was expected to hit the region. “All ten individuals aboard the Bering Air plane have been officially brought home,” the fire department wrote in the social media post at about 3 p.m. Crews were still working on recovering the aircraft, the fire department said. The Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet to the hub community of Nome when it disappeared Thursday afternoon. It was found the next day after an extensive search with all nine passengers and the pilot dead, making it one of the deadliest plane crashes in the state in 25 years. The aircraft is on an ice floe that is drifting about 5 miles (8 kilometers) a day, creating difficult conditions for recovery crews, said National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy during a press conference Saturday afternoon. “Please know that we’ll work diligently to determine how this happened with the ultimate goal of improving safety in Alaska and across the United States,” said Homendy. As the community tried to process the deadly event, crews worked swiftly on unstable, slushy sea ice to recover the bodies and the wreckage. The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory, with snow and winds up to 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour) expected to hit the region Saturday night, lasting into Sunday evening. Among those killed in the crash were Rhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson. They had traveled to Unalakleet to service a heat recovery system vital to the community’s water plant, according to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. “The loss of these two incredible individuals and everyone else on board the plane will be felt all over Alaska,” David Beveridge, vice president of environmental health and engineering for the organization, said in a statement. The pilot, 34-year-old Chad Antill of Nome, was also killed. The other victims ranged in age from 30 to 58 years old. The flight was a regularly scheduled commuter trip, according to Lt. Ben Endres of the Alaska State Troopers. A photo provided by the Coast Guard showed the plane’s splintered body and debris lying on the sea ice. Two people in brightly colored emergency gear circled the wreckage. “It’s hard to accept the reality of our loss,” U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said during an evening news conference. Nome Mayor John Handeland choked up as he discussed the deaths and the response effort. “Nome is a strong community, and in challenging times we come together and support each other. I expect the outpouring of support to continue in the coming days as we all work to recover from this tragic incident,” Handeland said. The Cessna Caravan left Unalakleet at 2:37 p.m. Thursday, and officials lost contact with it less than an hour later, according to David Olson, director of operations for Bering Air. There was light snow and fog, with a temperature of 17 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.3 degrees Celsius), according to the National Weather Service. The Coast Guard said the aircraft went missing about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome. Radar forensic data provided by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol indicated that about 3:18 p.m., the plane had “some kind of event which caused them to experience a rapid loss in elevation and a rapid loss in speed,” Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said. “What that event is, I can’t speculate to.” McIntyre-Coble said he was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft. Planes carry an emergency locating transmitter. If exposed to seawater, the device sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message back to the Coast Guard to indicate an aircraft may be in distress. No such messages were received by the Coast Guard, he said. Rescuers were searching the aircraft’s last known location by helicopter when the wreckage was spotted, said Mike Salerno, a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard. Two rescue swimmers were lowered to investigate. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending nine people to the scene from various states. Flying is an essential mode of transportation in Alaska due to the vastness of the landscape and limited infrastructure, and it’s common to travel by small plane. The plane’s crash marks the third major U.S. aviation mishap in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. Bering Air serves 32 villages in western Alaska from hubs in Nome, Kotzebue and Unalakleet. Most destinations receive twice-daily scheduled flights Monday through Saturday. “Our hearts are heavy with grief as we process this heartbreaking news,” Bering Air wrote in a statement on its website. “At this time, our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those affected by this tragedy.” A phone line was set up to give updates and emotional support to people who had loved ones on board, Bering Air said. The company asked for privacy for everyone involved, and said it was committed to supporting authorities. Unalakleet is a community of about 690 people about 150 miles (about 240 kilometers) southeast of Nome and 395 miles (about 640 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage. The village is on the Iditarod trail, route of the world’s most famous sled dog race, during which mushers and their teams must cross the frozen Norton Sound. Nome, a Gold Rush town, is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1,000-mile (1,610-kilometer) Iditarod. The city said prayer vigils would be held Friday for those on board the plane, friends and family and those involved in search efforts. ___ Golden reported from Seattle.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-says-its-ready-to-negotiate-with-us-but-not-under-maximum-pressure-policy/,"TEHRAN, Iran — Iran is ready to negotiate a new nuclear agreement with the United States but not under the “maximum pressure” strategy of US President Donald Trump, Tehran’s chief diplomat suggested on Saturday. “The lifting of sanctions requires negotiations, but not within the framework of a ‘maximum pressure’ policy, because it would not be a negotiation but a form of surrender,” said Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in a statement published on Telegram. The foreign minister’s statement came after Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged the government on Friday not to negotiate with Washington, calling such an approach “reckless.” Khamenei, who has the final say on all strategic decisions in Iran, referred to Iran’s previous experience negotiating with the United States to justify his position, saying that negotiations with the US “are not intelligent, wise or honorable.” In 2015, Iran struck a landmark deal with the United States, France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia to regulate its nuclear program in return for the easing of international sanctions. However, in 2018, during his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the agreement and reinstated heavy sanctions on Tehran, despite European opposition, crippling the country’s economy. Trump on Wednesday called for a “verified nuclear peace agreement” with Iran, adding that it “cannot have a nuclear weapon.” Iran insists its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes and denies any intention to develop atomic weapons. However, the UN nuclear watchdog has said that Iran is currently enriching uranium to levels that have no civilian use, and Iran’s leaders have for many years been issuing threats to flatten entire Israeli cities. The US president reinstated on Tuesday his “maximum pressure” policy, and Washington on Thursday announced financial sanctions on entities and individuals accused of shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian crude oil to China. Aragchi said on Saturday that “Iran does not want to negotiate with a country that is simultaneously imposing new sanctions.” Times of Israel Staff contributed to this report.","Iran says it’s ready to negotiate with US, but not under ‘maximum pressure’ policy",AFP,The Times of Israel,2025-02-08T22:49:11,2025-02-08T23:02:19,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/china-us-panama-canal-belt-road-9452852d8e074902d3f2a75fa73f5060,"BEIJING (AP) — China on Friday lashed out at what it called U.S. “coercion” after Panama declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing following Washington’s threat to take back the Panama Canal. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a briefing that China “firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.” Assistant Foreign Minister Zhao Zhiyuan also met Panama’s ambassador to China and lodged solemn representations on Friday, the Foreign Ministry said Saturday. The Belt and Road Initiative is President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign police drive to bind China closer to countries in the region and beyond by building roads, railways, airports, power plants and other infrastructure. The program has completed some major projects but also raised concerns about debt and environmental impact. Panama’s decision to walk away from it was seen as a concession to the U.S. over the canal after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Panamanian leader José Raúl Mulino on Sunday that Panama must immediately reduce what President Donald Trump says is Chinese influence over the canal area or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino has rejected pressure from the new U.S. government to discuss ownership of a waterway that is vital to global trade. Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. Despite that, some believe Panama may be open to a compromise under which canal operations on both sides are taken away from the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports company, which was given a 25-year no-bid extension to run them. An audit into the suitability of that extension is already underway and could lead to a rebidding process. A drop in water levels in the canal due to drought has slowed transit through the canal, raising further complaints from Trump, although the delays appear to have nothing to do with China. Lin said the Belt and Road Initiative has brought “active participation” from over 150 countries and that it has brought “fruitful results” to Panama and China, but gave no examples. “We hope Panama will bear in mind the general picture of bilateral relationship and the long-term interests of both peoples, resist external interference, and make the right decision,” Lin said.",China lashes out at US 'coercion' after Panama declines to renew infrastructure agreement,,AP News,2025-02-07T09:21:38,2025-02-08T04:23:51,gemini-2.0-flash

Clashes have been ongoing for three days between Syrian security forces and Lebanese clans in the border area.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c627d55v07go,"More than three decades after leaving the Soviet Union, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have begun to unplug from Russia's electricity grid and join the EU's network. The two-day process began on Saturday morning, with residents told to charge their devices, stock up on food and water, and prepare as if severe weather is forecast. Many have been told not to use lifts - while in some areas traffic lights will be turned off. A giant, specially-made clock, will count down the final seconds before the transition at a landmark ceremony in Lithuania's capital on Sunday, attended by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. The three nations will then officially transition away from the grid that has connected them to Russia since the years after World War Two. 'On high alert' The so-called Brell power grid - which stands for Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania - is controlled almost entirely by Moscow and has long been seen as a vulnerability for the three Baltic states. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are now Nato members and have not purchased electricity from Russia since 2022, but their connection to the Brell grid left them dependent on Moscow for energy flow. After disconnecting on Saturday morning, the three countries will carry out frequency tests before integrating into the European grid via Poland on Sunday. ""We are now removing Russia's ability to use the electricity system as a tool of geopolitical blackmail,"" Lithuania's Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas told AFP news agency. ""It's the culmination of efforts over more than 10 years or 20 years, to reduce that energy dependence,"" Prof David Smith of the Baltic Research Unit at the University of Glasgow told the BBC. ""When the Baltic States joined the EU and Nato, everybody talked about them being an energy island that was still dependent on that joint electricity network with Belarus and Russia,"" said Smith. ""That's been completely broken now."" Tensions between the Baltic States and Russia, which share a combined 543 mile-long (874km) border, have soared since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Since then, a spate of suspected sabotage incidents involving electricity cables and pipelines in the Baltic Sea have prompted fears that Moscow could retaliate against the shift towards EU energy. The oil tanker Eagle S was seized by Finnish authorities on suspicion of damaging undersea cables In the past 18 months, at least 11 cables running under the Baltic Sea have been damaged. In a recent case,  a ship from Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of oil tankers was accused of damaging Estonia's main power link in the Gulf of Finland. The Kremlin declined to comment. Nato has not accused Russia, but has responded by launching a new patrol mission of the region named Baltic Sentry. ""We cannot rule out some kind of provocation. That is why Latvian and foreign security authorities are on high alert,"" Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs said on Wednesday. ""Clearly there are risks, we understand that very well,"" Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina echoed. ""But the risks are identified and there is a contingency plan."" 'Cyber-attacks'  A spokesperson from the Nato Energy Security Centre of Excellence told the BBC that in recent months, frequent emergency operation tests have been carried out to help prepare for potential targeted attacks on the energy system. The head of Estonia's Cybersecurity Centre, Gert Auvaart, told the BBC in a statement that Russia ""may attempt to exploit this period to create uncertainty"", but said that due to international co-operation, Estonia was  ""well-prepared even for worst-case scenarios"". He added that cyber-attacks against the country had surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and ranged from ""hacktivist-driven DDoS attacks [Distributed Denial-Of-Service] to more sophisticated, targeted operations against government agencies and businesses"". The Baltic states will also be on watch for disinformation campaigns related to the transition. Shortly after they notified Russia of their decision to withdraw from Brell in August 2024, campaigns emerged on social media falsely warning of supply failures and soaring prices if the countries were to leave the joint power grid.",Baltic states begin historic switch away from Russian power grid,Tom Bennett,BBC News,2025-02-08T01:09:57,2025-02-08T05:28:27,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-841187,"Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei met with senior Hamas members on Saturday. The meeting is one of the most recent high-profile gatherings by the ayatollah, and it reflects Iran’s view that the terrorist group was victorious in the 15-month war with Israel, which began with the Hamas massacre on October 7, 2023. “Palestine will emerge victorious against its enemies,” Khamenei said, according to Iranian state media. Muhammad Ismail Darwish, chairman of Hamas’s Shura Council, and Khalil al-Hayya, deputy chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau, were in Iran this weekend. They usually live in Qatar, a major non-NATO ally of the US. Hamas members have flown between Doha and Tehran in the past and can often meet openly in Qatar with Iranian officials. Darwish and other Hamas officials were seen in photos distributed by the Iranian regime during their meeting with Khamenei. The ayatollah said the people of Gaza defeated “the Zionist regime, and in fact, America, and didn’t let them reach any of their goals,” Iran’s Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported. Iranian media noted that the country believes post-war Gaza will be run “entirely by the Palestinian people.” This report came on Saturday after Hamas released three Israeli hostages – Or Levy, Ohad Ben-Ami, and Eli Sharabi – who appeared emaciated. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said that they “look like Holocaust survivors.” Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch said, “The State of Israel views with grave concern the repeated violations of Hamas, and with even greater concern the condition of the three hostages released this morning. This will not go unaddressed. The message was conveyed to the mediators, and measures will be taken accordingly.” Meanwhile, Iran hosted Hamas officials. Iranian media noted that the meeting came during the “fifth prisoner exchange with Israel.” Hamas clearly believes it will run Gaza and is not afraid of either Israeli claims or US President Donald Trump’s plan that was released when he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week. Hamas is bragging in Gaza that “we are a storm...We are the post-war day,” according to a statement the terrorist group placed on a poster during the latest hostage release. Hamas also claims that it abides by “human values and the provisions of international humanitarian law.” This is in contrast to how the hostages appeared on Saturday. Hamas is clearly aware of this and is spreading propaganda. “Hamas reiterated that the Palestinian people stood firm against the occupiers and rejected any plans by Israel and its ally, the United States, to forcibly displace Gazans from their homeland,” Iranian state media reported. “The absolute victory that war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu and the occupying army sought for 471 days was an illusion that has been shattered forever,” Hamas said. The Iranian high-level meeting with Hamas officials is supposed to show that Iran and Hamas will continue to coordinate. It is designed to respond to Trump’s assertions.",Iran's Khamenei meets Hamas leaders during Gaza hostage release,SETH J.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-841177,"Released hostages Or Levy, Eli (Eliyahu) Sharabi, and Ohad Ben Ami crossed the border into Israeli territory on Saturday after spending 491 days in captivity, leaving 76 hostages, both dead and alive, remaining in the Gaza Strip. An initial medical examination reported to Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Sheba Medical Center revealed that the former hostages were in serious condition. They appeared starved and may have lost some 30% of their overall weight. The IDF initially estimated that the hostages would be returned at around 10:00 a.m. in central Gaza. Ultimately, they were not brought out until a little over an hour later. ICRC vehicles arrived in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza to collect the three from the Hamas terrorist organization, and Red Cross personnel signed documents given by Hamas for their release. Appearing frail and being supported by Hamas terrorists, the three hostages were forced to speak onstage before being handed over to the ICRC. In live streams from the Jordanian Alghad TV and Al Jazeera, a stage similar to the one used by Hamas during previous hostage releases was seen. Numerous armed Hamas terrorists were also at the scene. ""Two hundred Qassam members (members of Hamas's military wing) are participating in securing the handover of the Israeli detainees,"" a Hamas source told the Saudi news outlet Asharq Al-Awsat prior to the release of the Israeli captives. Later, Gazan civilians, including women and children, could be seen flooding in to observe the event. ""The disturbing images from the release of Ohad, Eli, and Or serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt - there is no time to waste for the hostages!"" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum stated shortly after the three hostages were released. ""We must get them all out, down to the very last hostage. Now!"" The Prime Minister's Office issued a statement announcing its pleasure over the return of the hostages, adding that it was committed to returning the hostages who still remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza. ""The Israeli government embraces the return of the hostages. Their families have been updated that they are with our forces,"" the PMO stated. ""The shocking images that we have seen today will not go unaddressed,"" referring to the serious conditions the hostages were in when they were released, notably having lost a lot of weight while in captivity. The PMO also stated that ""In light of the dire condition of the three hostages and the repeated violations by the Hamas terrorist organization, Prime Minister Netanyahu has instructed not to overlook this and to take appropriate action."" Opposition Leader Yair Lapid accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of not taking the conditions of the hostages seriously on Saturday. â		Did you now see that the conditions of the hostages are serious?â		 Lapid asked. â		Didn't you know before? Because it was written in the intelligence documents that were placed on your desk in recent months. You have seen these reports just like I have.â		 Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the severe weight loss and serious conditions of released hostages is a ""crime against humanity"" in an X post on Saturday. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar conveyed a message to his international counterparts worldwide on Saturday on the severity of the crimes Hamas committed against the hostages they’ve held captive. â		For over a year, the entire international community has danced to the false sound of the so-called ‘starvation’ propaganda in Gaza. â		But the pictures don't lie: The Hamas terrorists and the Gaza residents look great. The Israeli hostages look like Holocaust survivors and are the only ones in the photos who appear to have clearly suffered from starvation. 		 Hamas committed crimes against humanity on kidnapped civilians,â		 he continued. â		The Hamas-Nazi evil must be eradicated.â		 In exchange for the three hostages, Israel turned over 183 Palestinian security prisoners. Many of the Palestinians have been convicted of terrorism offenses and have been involved in the murder of Israelis. Levy, Sharabi, and Ben Ami were kidnapped on October 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel. A report from Channel 12 indicated that Sharabi told IDF soldiers he was looking forward to meeting his wife, Leanne, and daughters Noya, 16, and Yahel, 13, unaware they had been tragically murdered in their home in Be'eri in the October 7 massacre, as Hamas terrorists dragged him to the Gaza Strip. ""Eli is returning from an impossible reality in captivity to a very difficult reality in Israel,"" Kibbutz Be'eri said in a statement. ""A reality in which those dearest to him are no longer alive - on October 7, Eli lost his daughters Noya and Yahel, and his wife Leanne, who were murdered in their house in Be'eri in the terrible massacre. His brother, the late Yossi Sharabi, was murdered in captivity, and his body is still being held in Gaza. We will embrace him and give him the best possible support."" Yulie, Ella, and Natalie, the daughters of former hostage Ohad Ben Ami, spoke with their father on Saturday at Ichilov Hospital after his release from Hamas captivity, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum reported. ""Our father has emerged from the horror, and you can see the trauma he endured written on his face,"" Yulie, Ella, and Natalie stated. ""But we are staying strong for him here, just as he stays strong for us, and soon, we'll be able to embrace him. We got our father back. Now, we must not stop until the last hostage is returned.""

https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/taiwan-sends-officials-to-us-to-discuss-possible-trump-tariffs,"TAIPEI – Taiwan has sent officials to Washington to discuss possible US tariffs by President Donald Trump, and has made preparations should they be imposed, Economic Affairs Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said on Feb 8. Tech firms in Taiwan, home to the world’s largest contract chipmaker TSMC, face the possibility that Mr Trump will follow through on threats to put tariffs on imported chips after he accused Taiwan during his 2024 campaign of having stolen American semiconductor business. Mr Trump said on Feb 7 that he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on many economies by Feb 10 or Feb 11, a major escalation of his offensive to reshape global trade relationships in ways he considers to be in America’s favour. Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Mr Kuo said the Ministry of Economic Affairs has made preparations for any US tariffs, but declined to give details. Asked about chip tariffs, Mr Kuo said he has dispatched a deputy minister and a deputy section chief to Washington. He did not identify them or offer further details. They will, as much as possible, “give some rather good explanations to Trump’s people” about Taiwan’s chip industry, he added, without elaborating. “Taiwan is the United States’ best partner.” Taiwan has repeatedly said its chip sector and US companies have “win-win” cooperation. But Taiwan runs a large trade surplus with the US that surged 83 per cent in 2024, with the island’s exports to the US hitting a record US$111.4 billion (S$151 billion), driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors. Mr Kuo suggested that Taiwan could follow Japan’s example and import more US energy. “In reference to Japan, he has great determination when it comes to energy,” he said, referring to Mr Trump. “We hope we can satisfy US demands when it comes to this.” Japan will soon begin importing a record amount of US liquefied natural gas (LNG), Mr Trump said on Feb 7, after talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Australia and Qatar are currently Taiwan’s main suppliers of LNG. REUTERS JoinST's Telegram channeland get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-politicians-journalist-jailed-5e1fdd9931ac621037a4132b07d9bbeb,"A judge in Tunisia handed down lengthy sentences to prominent politicians and at least one leading journalist in a move criticized by a media union and leading opposition parties as the latest move targeting critics of President Kais Saied. Among those sentenced Wednesday include 83-year-old Rached Ghannouchi, the country’s most prominent opposition leader, who has been behind bars for nearly two years. Ghannouchi, the co-founder of the Islamist movement Ennahda and Tunisia’s former Assembly Speaker, was sentenced to an additional 22 years in prison for undermining state security. He boycotted the proceedings against him. Ennahda condemned the trial as politically motivated and said the prosecutions were “aimed at revenge, violating basic human rights and freedoms, undermining the rule of law and blatantly politicizing the judiciary.” The National Salvation Front, a coalition of opposition parties that includes Ennahda, said in a statement that the sentences issued against bloggers, politicians and former government officials totaled more than 760 years and marked “one of the darkest periods” for the country’s judicial branch, which has seen judges dismissed and power wrested from it by Saied’s executive branch. “This particular chamber is becoming a specialized tool for issuing harsh sentences against politicians,” said one of its leaders, Ahmed Nejib Chebbi. The charges stem from a 2019 case against a media company that provided services for Ennahda during that year’s presidential elections. The charges stem from a 2019 case against a media company that prosecutors say provided services for various candidates during that year’s presidential elections. Those involved are accused of defamation, spreading falsehoods, money laundering, undermining state security and illegally accepting funds from abroad. Ennahda has denied working with the company yet was targeted by the court as part of the investigation. Human rights groups have criticized such cases as a way to target Saied’s opponents. Saied won a second term last October in a landslide election while his leading opponents, including Ghannouchi, languished in prison. “These rulings bring Tunisia back to a period the people sought to leave behind through their revolution,” an Ennahda statement on Thursday said, referring to the 2011 ouster of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the first Arab dictator toppled as part of the Arab Spring uprising that swept the region that year. In the years that followed, the North African nation was seen as a success story for its transition to democracy, rewriting its constitution and winning a Nobel Peace Prize for political compromise. But signs of authoritarianism have re-emerged since Saied took power in 2019. Throughout his tenure, Saied has suspended parliament, rewritten the constitution to consolidate his power and arrested politicians, activists and journalists who criticized him. The court on Wednesday also sentenced in absentia a group of Ennahda politicians who’ve fled the country and now live in exile, including former Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, who was sentenced to 35 years on state security charges similar to Ghannouchi’s. Journalist Chadha Haj Mubarak was sentenced to five years in prison as part of the same case, the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists said. The union called for her immediate release and in a statement denounced the court’s lack of respect for press freedoms.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c627d55v07go,"More than three decades after leaving the Soviet Union, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have begun to unplug from Russia's electricity grid and join the EU's network. The two-day process began on Saturday morning, with residents told to charge their devices, stock up on food and water, and prepare as if severe weather is forecast. Many have been told not to use lifts - while in some areas traffic lights will be turned off. A giant, specially-made clock, will count down the final seconds before the transition at a landmark ceremony in Lithuania's capital on Sunday, attended by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. The three nations will then officially transition away from the grid that has connected them to Russia since the years after World War Two. 
'On high alert'
The so-called Brell power grid - which stands for Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania - is controlled almost entirely by Moscow and has long been seen as a vulnerability for the three Baltic states. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are now Nato members and have not purchased electricity from Russia since 2022, but their connection to the Brell grid left them dependent on Moscow for energy flow. After disconnecting on Saturday morning, the three countries will carry out frequency tests before integrating into the European grid via Poland on Sunday. ""We are now removing Russia's ability to use the electricity system as a tool of geopolitical blackmail,"" Lithuania's Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas told AFP news agency. ""It's the culmination of efforts over more than 10 years or 20 years, to reduce that energy dependence,"" Prof David Smith of the Baltic Research Unit at the University of Glasgow told the BBC. ""When the Baltic States joined the EU and Nato, everybody talked about them being an energy island that was still dependent on that joint electricity network with Belarus and Russia,"" said Smith. ""That's been completely broken now."" Tensions between the Baltic States and Russia, which share a combined 543 mile-long (874km) border, have soared since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Since then, a spate of suspected sabotage incidents involving electricity cables and pipelines in the Baltic Sea have prompted fears that Moscow could retaliate against the shift towards EU energy. 
The oil tanker Eagle S was seized by Finnish authorities on suspicion of damaging undersea cables
In the past 18 months, at least 11 cables running under the Baltic Sea have been damaged. In a recent case,  a ship from Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of oil tankers was accused of damaging Estonia's main power link in the Gulf of Finland. The Kremlin declined to comment. Nato has not accused Russia, but has responded by launching a new patrol mission of the region named Baltic Sentry. ""We cannot rule out some kind of provocation. That is why Latvian and foreign security authorities are on high alert,"" Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs said on Wednesday. ""Clearly there are risks, we understand that very well,"" Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina echoed. ""But the risks are identified and there is a contingency plan."" 
'Cyber-attacks'
A spokesperson from the Nato Energy Security Centre of Excellence told the BBC that in recent months, frequent emergency operation tests have been carried out to help prepare for potential targeted attacks on the energy system. The head of Estonia's Cybersecurity Centre, Gert Auvaart, told the BBC in a statement that Russia ""may attempt to exploit this period to create uncertainty"", but said that due to international co-operation, Estonia was  ""well-prepared even for worst-case scenarios"". He added that cyber-attacks against the country had surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and ranged from ""hacktivist-driven DDoS attacks [Distributed Denial-Of-Service] to more sophisticated, targeted operations against government agencies and businesses"". The Baltic states will also be on watch for disinformation campaigns related to the transition. Shortly after they notified Russia of their decision to withdraw from Brell in August 2024, campaigns emerged on social media falsely warning of supply failures and soaring prices if the countries were to leave the joint power grid.",Baltic states begin historic switch away from Russian power grid,Tom Bennett,BBC News,2025-02-07T20:09:57,2025-02-08T04:28:27,gemini-2.0-flash

During talks with Woo Won-shik in China's northeastern city of Harbin, Xi said he is ""seriously considering"" attending the APEC gathering to take place in Gyeongju, about 270 kilometers southeast of Seoul, around late October or early November.

It marked the first time since 2014 that Xi has met a Korean Assembly speaker. In the meeting, Xi also said he hopes to maintain ""stability"" in the Seoul-Beijing relationship, noting that the bilateral relationship has contributed to ""peace"" and ""development"" in the region. ""China and South Korea should work together to consolidate the strategic and cooperative partnership amid heightened uncertainties in the region and across the globe,"" Xi added, calling for deeper trade and economic cooperation between the two countries. Woo called for bilateral cooperation in advanced technologies and supply chains as well as progress in negotiations to expand the countries' free trade agreement. On the ongoing political turmoil in South Korea, Xi said he believes South Koreans have the ""wisdom and power"" to solve the situation, referring to the martial law fiasco and the push to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol, according to Woo's office. Woo told Xi that South Korea is responding to the situation in accordance with related laws and the Constitution, explaining the country is not unstable. The two also discussed other various topics, including China's ban on Korean culture content as well as a project aimed at excavating the remains of Ahn Jung-geun, a well-known Korean independence fighter during the colonial era. During Japan's colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945, Ahn led Korea's independence movement in China, assassinating Ito Hirobumi, Japan's first prime minister and resident-general of Korea, at Harbin Station. As for culture, Woo told Xi it is difficult to find Korean content in China, while South Koreans enjoy diverse Chinese content from movies to games. ""It is essential that young adults in the two countries communicate with each other and have an amicable relationship through cultural exchange,"" Woo said.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/hostages-eli-sharabi-or-levy-and-ohad-ben-ami-slated-for-release-from-gaza-saturday/,"Hamas on Friday evening named three hostages set to be released from captivity the next day, following an hours-long delay past the 4 p.m. deadline. The Prime Minister’s Office and the Hostages Families Forum both confirmed that the hostages to be released were Ohad Ben Ami, 56, Eli Sharabi, 52, and Or Levy, 34. The release was expected to begin on Saturday morning. Sharabi was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri when Hamas terrorists rampaged through southern Israel on October 7, 2023. His wife and daughters were murdered in their home’s safe room and he and his brother Yossi were taken captive. Yossi has since been confirmed dead and Hamas is holding his body. Sharabi’s family said in a statement: “Today more than ever, we want to show him he was never alone. We want him to know he’s returning to a people who stood by him, in Israel and around the world, that did not forget him or give up, that fought for him and that will be there for him now in his journey back to life.” Levy, 34, was kidnapped from the Supernova rave near Kibbutz Re’im on October 7. His wife Eynav was killed, and their now three-year-old son Almog has been staying with his grandparents since. He has been told for the past 16 months that his father is missing and is being searched for. Levy’s mother Ola told Channel 13: “My heart’s about to leap out of my chest. I’m so emotional, mainly for Or’s son Almog. Almog knows his dad’s being released tomorrow. He said ‘Dad’s coming back’ and jumped up and down on the bed with joy.” Levy’s brother Michael wrote on Facebook: “Mogi, we found your dad.” Ben Ami was kidnapped from Be’eri. His wife Raz Ben Ami was also abducted, and released as part of a week-long ceasefire in November 2023. Their daughters campaigned hard for their freedom. Daughter Ell Ben Ami published an Instagram video of her and her overjoyed sisters piling up on each other on their balcony as they croon “Dad’s coming home!” Daughter Natalie posted a video of herself tearing up immediately after hearing the news, writing, “Finally our hearts will be whole!” ×©×¤×	×

The terror group’s delay in providing the list of hostages to be freed Saturday underlined the obstacles hanging over the fragile deal that has halted the war in Gaza. Earlier Hamas had accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire accord, claiming it had delayed the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying food and other humanitarian supplies agreed under the truce deal that took effect on January 19, and holding back all but a fraction of the tents and mobile homes needed to provide shelter to people returning to their bombed-out homes. “This demonstrates clear manipulation of relief and shelter priorities,” Hamas said in a statement. COGAT, the Israeli military agency that is overseeing the aid deliveries into Gaza, denied the accusation and warned that Israel would “not tolerate violations by Hamas.” The Prime Minister’s Office also put out a statement saying the Israeli leader viewed such violations “gravely.” The spat compounds the uncertainty around the ceasefire that had already mounted following US President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement this week that he wants Gaza to be taken over by the United States. Trump said on Tuesday he wanted to move the population of Gaza to a third country like Egypt or Jordan and place the small coastal enclave under US control to be developed into the “Riviera of the Middle East.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsed Trump’s vision for Gaza as a “remarkable” plan, but it was immediately rejected by Arab countries, Palestinian groups including Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, and many Gazans, who said they would rebuild their homes themselves. However, Israeli leaders have repeated the line that Gazans who wish should be able to leave and Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered the army on Thursday to prepare a plan to allow for the departure of Gaza residents who wanted to go. So far, 13 Israeli hostages of the 33 children, women and older men set to be released in the first, 42-day phase of the agreement have come home, and hundreds of Palestinian terror convicts have been released in exchange. Five Thai hostages have also been returned. Work on the potential second stage of the multi-phase agreement, aimed at securing the release of around 60 male hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, has begun and an Israeli negotiating team was expected to fly on Saturday to Doha, Hebrew media reported on Friday. The Israeli military said on Friday that commanders were conducting situational assessments ahead of the next phase of the agreement currently being discussed, with troops deployed at various points around the Gaza Strip. Hamas said only 8,500 trucks out of the 12,000 that should have arrived so far had entered the territory, most containing food and secondary goods including chips and chocolate instead of more urgent items. In addition, only 10% of the 200,000 tents and 60,000 caravans needed to provide shelter had arrived, Hamas said, leaving hundreds of thousands in harsh winter weather. Finally, heavy machinery needed to clear millions of tons of rubble and recover the thousands of bodies thought to be buried had not arrived. Almost three weeks after the start of the ceasefire, “the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate dangerously,” the Hamas statement said. Israel has rejected accusations that it is dragging its feet on enabling the entry to aid supplies as “a completely unfounded claim,” saying it has allowed in thousands of trucks, including tents and shelters. COGAT said more than 100,000 tents had entered Gaza since the agreement came into force last month and that caravans were also being allowed in, while tractors had entered from Egypt since Sunday. It said 12,600 trucks had entered Gaza so far. Friday also saw freed hostages Keith Siegel, 65, and Ofer Calderon, 54, discharged from hospitals after spending several days under care following their release from Gaza. In a statement upon his release, the Calderon family said that Ofer’s “journey to recovery is still long and will not end until all the hostages return home.” “Ofer promises to join the fight for their return at the first opportunity he can,” they added. The third hostage freed with Calderon and Siegel last Saturday was Yarden Bibas, whose wife and young children remain in Gaza, their fates unknown. According to Channel 12 news, Israel is pressuring mediators to secure the release of Shiri Bibas and her young sons, Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 2. Hamas was to release living women and children first under the deal, and Israel has said it has “grave concern” for their lives. A Hamas official cited by the network said the terror group would see how Trump’s plan to “take over” the Gaza Strip progresses before deciding on the fate of the deal. According to the network, the terror group is unlikely to thwart the rest of the first phase, including Saturday’s expected hostage release. In total, Israel has said it would release up to 1,904 Palestinian prisoners — including 737 serving life terms for dozens of murders — in return for 33 Israeli hostages during the deal’s first phase. Though talks for the second phase were supposed to commence Monday, Netanyahu has pushed off sending a negotiating team, reportedly until he returns from Washington next week. A working-level negotiating team, led by the outgoing Shin Bet deputy director — known by his Hebrew initial “Mem” — is expected in Doha over the weekend, but is empowered to discuss only the first phase, not the second, according to Channel 12. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s spokesman denied reports that the premier presented in Washington a plan to end the fighting in Gaza — a sine qua non for the second stage, but a red line for the right flank of Netanyahu’s coalition. The delay in talks on the second phase has deeply worried the families of male hostages who are not set to be released until phases two and three. Moshe Or, brother of hostage Avinatan Or, told Channel 12 that “there is a feeling that the second phase is disintegrating. [People are] starting to talk about all sorts of other things, flattening Gaza, moving the Palestinians… In our view it’s unacceptable and scary that [they’re] starting to talk that way and forget about [the hostages].” Avinatan marked his 32nd birthday on Thursday. His girlfriend Noa Argamani, who was rescued from Hamas captivity in June, wrote on Instagram that she was “doing everything to get you back, to get to the second phase of the deal so you’re not left behind.” Argamani herself is currently in Washington with a delegation of hostage families determined to ensure that the deal proceeds to its second phase. On Thursday, Trump honored her in a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, saying she “showed unwavering strength and courage and faith as she endured the unendurable.” “By the grace of God, she was rescued by the Israel Defense Forces and now she’s come back to pray with us this morning,” said Trump. “As president, I will not rest until every remaining hostage has been returned to their families,” he vowed.","Hostages Eli Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami slated for release from Gaza Saturday",ToI Staff,The Times of Israel,2025-02-07T18:06:55,2025-02-08T07:58:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/missing-aircraft-alaska-search-10-people-eb496188285ed54c9a527f658d4ff70a,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — A small commuter plane that crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome was located Friday on sea ice, and all 10 people on board were dead, authorities said. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in the last 25 years. Rescuers were searching the aircraft’s last known location by helicopter when the wreckage was spotted, said Mike Salerno, a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard. Two rescue swimmers were lowered to investigate. A photo provided by the Coast Guard showed the plane’s splintered body and debris lying on the sea ice. Two people in brightly colored emergency gear circled the wreckage. “It’s hard to accept the reality of our loss,” U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said during an evening news conference. Nome Mayor John Handeland choked up as he discussed the deaths and the response effort. “Nome is a strong community, and in challenging times we come together and support each other. I expect the outpouring of support to continue in the coming days as we all work to recover from this tragic incident,” Handeland said. A prayer service was announced for later in the evening. Related Stories Already the focus was shifting to a recovery operation because of rapidly changing conditions. Officials outlined the challenges including bad weather expected in the next 18 hours and “young ice” that was slushy and not stable. “They are on the ice as we speak,” said Jim West, chief of the Nome Volunteer Fire Department. “The conditions out there are dynamic, and so we’ve got to do it safely and the fastest way we can.” The Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet on Thursday afternoon with nine passengers and a pilot, Alaska’s Department of Public Safety said. It was operating at its maximum passenger capacity, according to the airline’s description of the plane. The Cessna Caravan left Unalakleet at 2:37 p.m., and officials lost contact with it less than an hour later, according to David Olson, director of operations for Bering Air. There was light snow and fog, with a temperature of 17 degrees (minus 8.3 Celsius), according to the National Weather Service. The Coast Guard said the aircraft went missing about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome. Radar forensic data provided by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol indicated that about 3:18 p.m., the plane had “some kind of event which caused them to experience a rapid loss in elevation and a rapid loss in speed,” Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said. “What that event is, I can’t speculate to.” McIntyre-Coble said he was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft. Planes carry an emergency locating transmitter. If exposed to seawater, the device sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message back to the Coast Guard to indicate an aircraft may be in distress. No such messages were received by the Coast Guard, he said. All 10 people on board the plane were adults, and the flight was a regularly scheduled commuter trip, according to Lt. Ben Endres of the Alaska State Troopers. Two people who died in the crash were on a work trip for a non-profit tribal health organization, according to Alaska’s News Source. The other people’s names have not been released. Local, state and federal agencies had assisted in the search effort, combing stretches of ice-dotted waters and scouring miles of frozen tundra. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending nine people to the scene from various states. Flying is an essential mode of transportation in Alaska due to the vastness of the landscape and limited infrastructure. Most communities are not connected to the developed road system that serves the state’s most populous region, and it’s common to travel by small plane. Some high school teams fly to sporting events against rival high schools, and goods are brought to many communities by barge or by air. The plane’s crash marks the third major U.S. aviation mishap in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. Bering Air serves 32 villages in western Alaska from hubs in Nome, Kotzebue and Unalakleet. Most destinations receive twice-daily scheduled flights Monday through Saturday. Unalakleet is a community of about 690 people about 150 miles (about 240 kilometers) southeast of Nome and 395 miles (about 640 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage. The village is on the Iditarod trail, route of the world’s most famous sled dog race, during which mushers and their teams must cross the frozen Norton Sound. Nome, a Gold Rush town, is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1,000-mile (1,610-kilometer) Iditarod. The city said prayer vigils would be held Friday for those on board the plane, friends and family and those involved in search efforts. ___ Golden reported from Seattle.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjdp7m7wkdo,"Gang rule in Haiti has led to a staggering rise in sexual violence against children, the United Nations' children's organisation has warned. The Caribbean island has been in the grip of violent gangs for several years who have been treating the population with unrelenting brutality, Unicef said. Sexual violence against children has increased 1,000% since 2023, turning their bodies ""into battlegrounds"", spokesman James Elder said. Unicef estimates 85% of the capital Port-au-Prince is under the control of gangs. More than one million children are living with the constant threat of violence. Mr Elder gave an example of a 16-year-old girl who had left home to go shopping, and then was seized by armed men. She was beaten, drugged, and repeatedly raped. She was held for around one month, he said, until the gang let her go when they realised her family had no money to pay a ransom. Kidnappings for extortion are common in Haiti. She is now in a UN shelter with dozens of other girls receiving care. Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis. More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti last year alone. Haiti's transitional presidential council, the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order, appears to be in turmoil. The council replaced the interim prime minister in November but has made little progress towards organising long-delayed elections. Children are also being recruited by the gangs, sometimes forcibly, Unicef said. The organisation has come across child gang members who are as young as eight. The basics that Haitian children need for a normal childhood, even if they are still at home with their families, are virtually non-existent said Unicef. Schools and hospitals are barely functioning and tens of thousands of children are not in school. Unicef has created mobile safe spaces in Haiti to try to support children, and to prevent sexual violence. But last year, when it appealed for $221.4m (£177.8m) to fund its work in Haiti, it received just a quarter of that. It's feared now that with the US freeze on foreign aid affecting humanitarian projects worldwide, Haiti's needs will be neglected again.","Sexual violence against children in Haiti rises by 1,000%, UN says",Imogen Foulkes,BBC News,2025-02-07T08:30:20,2025-02-07T08:38:30,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.voanews.com/a/china-may-fill-aid-void-left-by-usaid-shutdown-but-its-own-challenges-could-limit-it/7965690.html,"WASHINGTON —
The U.S. foreign aid agency broadly shut down by the Trump administration has long been criticized by Beijing. But as USAID projects wind down, will Beijing step in to try to build influence? Some analysts say although China will want to fill the vacuum, its own economic problems could limit what it will do.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is now the acting director of U.S. Agency for International Development, said he will bring the agency's activities in line with the agenda of the new government.
""These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest,"" he told reporters while visiting El Salvador earlier this week.
USAID had an annual budget of more than $40 billion and managed aid programs around the world, including a China-related program that has become a target of criticism by the White House.
On a ""waste and abuse"" fact sheet released on Feb. 3, the White House said USAID had given millions of dollars to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. organization working on protections against infectious disease. The organization has been accused of working with Wuhan Institute of Virology on coronavirus research that had caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Both EcoHealth Alliance and the Chinese government have rejected those accusations.
Agency has framed funding as strategy
In recent years, USAID has increasingly framed its funding for China-related programs as a strategy to contain China's global expansion through aid and investments.
An archived page of USAID's now-closed website shows that the agency lauded its ""Countering Chinese Influence Fund"" as one of its ""key accomplishments."" The fund ""will advance national-security goals"" to ""build more resilient partners that are able to withstand pressure from the CCP and other malign actors.""
Michael Schiffer, former USAID assistant administrator for Asia, told a congressional panel in 2023 that the agency had for more than a decade supported data collection on China's overseas investments through AidData, a research group at the College of William and Mary in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The funding freeze has put at least one such USAID-funded program in financial trouble. Brian Eyler, a researcher at the Stimson Center in Washington, wrote in a public post on Facebook his Southeast Asia program could have difficulty continuing operation because of the freeze.
""We are ordered to stop work on those grants for 90 days pending further review. And that means our Southeast Asia program might not be able to keep the lights on,"" he wrote.
Eyler is co-lead on the Mekong Dam Monitor, launched by the State Department during the first Trump administration to study how dams built by China and other countries on the Mekong River in southeast Asia have negatively affected communities downstream. In the past, the project had received funding from both the State Department and USAID.
Chinese state media had accused the project of smearing China.
In an email to VOA Mandarin, Eyler wrote that although the Mekong Dam Monitor is not being affected by the federal government’s grant freeze as the project has been supported through private funding since last fall, other projects focused on the Mekong River are now in financial jeopardy.
On Wednesday, Rubio said the Trump administration is in the process of identifying programs that are exempted from the funding freeze.
""This [is] not about ending foreign aid. It is about structuring it in a way that furthers the national interest of the United States,"" Rubio said during his multiday trip to Latin America.
Critics of USAID
USAID also has been a target of Beijing's ire. China's foreign ministry released a report last year accusing USAID programs of corruption and prioritizing the advancement of U.S. interests.
The shutdown of USAID has been met with cheers and celebrations on the Chinese internet, where anti-U.S. narratives permeate. Many users praised Elon Musk, the billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency, for closing the agency.
Musk previously posted on X describing USAID as ""a criminal organization"" and that it is time ""for it to die.""
USAID critics
Critics of the funding freeze and the shuttering of USAID worry that Beijing will see this as an opportunity to fill the void left by the U.S.
""China has spent trillions of dollars in numerous countries because it is interested in pulling them into its sphere of influence,"" U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Coons wrote in The Washington Post.
Steven Balla, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., told VOA Mandarin he agrees with the assessment. But he said China's plan to expand foreign aid is likely to be hindered by its lingering domestic problems.
""You think about youth unemployment; you think about the real estate bubble and so forth,"" he said. ""That might make it difficult for the Xi administration to aggressively expand into new parts of the world because the U.S is pulling back.""
Some activists worry that even if China tries to fill the void, certain areas where there once were U.S. aid programs will not receive the same kind of funding, if at all.
A former environmental lawyer in China who now lives in the U.S. told VOA Mandarin that, compared to U.S. aid programs, China's assistance is of a more transactional nature and seeks financial returns. She wants to remain anonymous because she fears harassment from Beijing.
A 2021 report released by China shows that between 2013 and 2018, China had spent $376 billion on foreign aid, 45% of which went to Africa in areas such as agriculture, medical assistance, food supply, disease control, and climate change.
The former environmental lawyer said if it is entirely left for China to provide aid, areas such as women's rights and natural resource management will lose a large portion of funding, if not entirely, because China is not interested in improving local governance.
""There will certainly be a very severe impact on the African people,"" she said, ""which isn't something you'll be able to see within just a day or two.""","Though China might aim to fill aid void left by USAID, its own challenges could limit it",Wenhao Ma,Voice of America (VOA News),2025-02-06T16:13:44,2025-02-07T13:31:21,gemini-2.0-flash
