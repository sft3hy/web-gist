https://apnews.com/article/turkey-afghanistan-taliban-diplomats-embassy-ankara-948241b9bcf2e8291c7d56c8a052bd6b,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey has terminated the mission of diplomats appointed by Afghanistan’s former pro-Western government, the outgoing diplomatic team said, in a move that paves the way for the Taliban to appoint their own envoys. The departing team said on X that it had handed over the embassy in Ankara to Turkey’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday. The unusually strongly-worded statement said that the decision by the Turkish government to end the mission was the result of pressure by the Taliban on the diplomats and Turkish officials. “The interim administration of Afghanistan announced the end of the term of office of the ambassador and some diplomats in November 2024, and the duties of the ambassador and relevant diplomats have ended. The embassy continues its activities,” a Turkish official, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press. “In order to alleviate the hardships experienced by the Afghan people, we are pursuing a policy of engagement in dialogue toward (Afghanistan) with the interim administration in Afghanistan,” the official added. The development marks the latest diplomatic success for the Taliban, which has moved to take control of the country’s embassies and consulates overseas after more than three years in power. The takeover of diplomatic missions in Turkey pushes that number to more than 40. “Due to the failed attempts of the Taliban to gain control of the embassy and the continuous pressure on the diplomats and employees of this embassy, as well as their pressure on the Turkish government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey has recently decided to terminate the mission of the ambassador and diplomats of this embassy,” the departing team said.

The statement said Turkey had made the decision to be able to keep open the country’s embassy in Kabul, and consulates in Mazar-e-Sharif and Herat. In Kabul, the Taliban-led Foreign Ministry said that “a change in the diplomatic staff in the diplomatic missions of countries is a normal practice.” “The Embassy of Afghanistan in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, continues its activities as usual and is at the service of its citizens and other clients,” Zakir Jalali, a senior ministry official, said in a statement. Last July, the Taliban said it no longer recognized diplomatic missions set up by the former Western-backed government. Most countries still haven’t accepted the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate rulers. Despite the Taliban and the West being at loggerheads, mostly because of the sweeping restrictions on women and girls, Afghan authorities have established ties with major regional powers including the Chinese government, Russia, and wealthy Gulf nations. _________ Robert Badendieck in Istanbul contributed.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-egypt-trump-displacement-bc1c43f80655190824a5de4eb1d310cc,"CAIRO (AP) — Israel says it has begun preparations for the departure of Palestinians from Gaza despite international rejection of President Donald Trump’s plan to empty the territory of its population. Egypt has launched a diplomatic blitz behind the scenes against the proposal, warning it would put its peace deal with Israel at risk, officials said. Trump administration officials have tried to dial back aspects of the proposal after it was widely rejected internationally, saying the relocation of Palestinians would be temporary. But officials have provided few details. In a social media post Thursday, Trump said that the Palestinians would be “resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes,” after which Israel would turn Gaza over to the United States. No U.S. soldiers would be needed for his plan to redevelop it, he said. Hours later, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio insisted again that the relocations would be temporary, with Palestinians living “somewhere else in the interim,” while Gaza is cleaned up and rebuilt. Palestinians have vehemently rejected Trump’s proposal, fearing that Israel would never allow refugees to return. Egypt has warned that an expulsion of Palestinians would destabilize the region and undermine its peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of stability and American influence for decades. Saudi Arabia, another key U.S. ally, has also rejected any mass transfer of Palestinians and says it will not normalize relations with Israel — a key goal of the Trump administration — without the creation of a Palestinian state that includes Gaza. Trump and Israeli officials have depicted the proposed relocation from war-ravaged Gaza as voluntary, but the Palestinians have universally expressed their determination to remain in their homeland. Trump and Israeli officials have not said how they would respond if Palestinians refuse to leave. But Human Rights Watch and other groups say the plan, if implemented, would amount to “ethnic cleansing,” the forcible relocation of the civilian population of an ethnic group from a geographic area. AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on Gaza residents’ reaction to Trump’s comments in a special report. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Thursday that he has ordered the military to make preparations to facilitate the emigration of large numbers of Palestinians from Gaza through land crossings as well as “special arrangements for exit by sea and air.” There were no immediate signs of such preparations on the ground. Egypt wages a behind-the-scenes campaign Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has not publicly responded to Trump’s stunning proposal that most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million Palestinians be relocated and the United States take charge of rebuilding the territory. Israel’s 15-month campaign against the militant Hamas group had reduced large parts of Gaza to rubble before a fragile ceasefire took hold last month. But in a statement Thursday, the Egyptian government rejected efforts to move Palestinians from Gaza as a “blatant violation” of international law that could undercut ceasefire talks and threaten Middle East relations. “This behavior provokes the return of hostilities and poses risks on the entire region and the foundations of peace,” the statement said. Egyptian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door talks, said Cairo has made clear to the Trump administration and Israel that it will resist any such proposal, and that the peace deal with Israel — which has stood for nearly half a century — is at risk. One official said the message has been delivered to the Pentagon, the State Department and members of the U.S. Congress. A second official said it has also been conveyed to Israel and its Western European allies, including Britain, France and Germany. A Western diplomat in Cairo, also speaking anonymously because the discussions have not been made public, confirmed receiving Egypt’s message of its strong opposition through multiple channels. The diplomat said Egypt was very serious and viewed the plan as a threat to its national security. The diplomat said Egypt rejected similar proposals from the Biden administration and European countries early in the war, which was sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. The earlier proposals were broached privately, while Trump announced his plan at a White House press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas, which still rules most of Gaza, has repeatedly condemned Trump’s proposal. On Thursday it said that any U.S. takeover of Gaza would be considered an occupation, implying that the militant group would respond with armed resistance. The group has yet to draw any connection between its objections to Trump’s proposal and the ongoing ceasefire. It’s unclear if it will have any impact on the next release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, set for Saturday. US officials scale back Trump’s proposal When Trump unveiled his proposal, he said he wanted to “permanently” resettle most of Gaza’s population in other countries, allowing the U.S. to rebuild it as a “Riviera of the Middle East” for all people. Egyptian officials said their government does not believe the Palestinians need to be relocated for reconstruction to proceed and is committed to the creation of a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel’s government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has said it will maintain open-ended security control over both Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community and considers the entire city its capital. Last week, Egypt hosted a meeting of top diplomats from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — which was the driving force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords Trump brokered with Israel. All five Arab nations rejected the transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza or the West Bank. In an editorial on Thursday, Egypt’s main state-run daily, Al-Ahram, warned that “the Arab countries’ independence, their peoples’ unity and their territorial integrity are under grave threat.” ___ Associated Press writer Natalie Melzer in Nahariya, Israel, and Adriana Gomez Licon in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at ",Israel prepares for Gaza exodus as per Trump's plan,SAMY MAGDY,AP News,2025-02-06T09:42:49,2025-02-06T01:15:46,gemini-2.0-flash
https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-ayatollah-khamenei-trump-0e8349df920017629b98a9f6b4d98c0a,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s supreme leader said Friday that negotiations with America “are not intelligent, wise or honorable” after President Donald Trump floated nuclear talks with Tehran. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also suggested that “there should be no negotiations with such a government,” but stopped short of issuing a direct order not to engage with Washington. Khamenei’s remarks upend months of signals from Tehran to the United States that it wanted to negotiate over its rapidly advancing nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of crushing economic sanctions worth billions of dollars. Following Khamenei’s comments, the Iranian rial sunk to a record low of 872,000 rials to $1 in aftermarket trading. What happens next remains unclear, particularly as reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian promised as recently as Thursday to enter into a dialogue with the West. Khamenei’s remarks to air force officers in Tehran appeared to contradict his own earlier remarks in August that opened the door to talks. However, the 85-year-old Khamenei has always been careful with remarks about negotiating with the West. That includes balancing the demands of reformists within the country who want the talks against hard-line elements within Iran’s theocracy, including the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Khamenei noted that Trump unilaterally withdrew from the earlier nuclear deal under which Iran drastically limited its enrichment of uranium and overall stockpile of the material, in exchange for crushing sanctions being removed. “The Americans did not uphold their end of the deal,” Khamenei said. “The very person who is in office today tore up the agreement. He said he would, and he did.” He added: “This is an experience we must learn from. We negotiated, we gave concessions, we compromised— but we did not achieve the results we aimed for. And despite all its flaws, the other side ultimately violated and destroyed the agreement.” It’s not clear what sparked Khamenei’s remarks. However, they come after Trump suggested he wanted to deal with Tehran, even while signing an executive order to reimpose his “maximum pressure” approach to Iran on Tuesday. “I’m going to sign it, but hopefully we’re not going to have to use it very much,” he said from the Oval Office. “We will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran.” “We don’t want to be tough on Iran. We don’t want to be tough on anybody,” Trump added. “But they just can’t have a nuclear bomb.” Trump followed with another online message on Wednesday, saying: “Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens, ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED.” “I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper,” he wrote on Truth Social. “We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed.” He did not elaborate. Khamenei, like other Iranian leaders, uses elliptical comments to indirectly govern policy while not boxing himself into any one decision. As supreme leader, he’s also created a vast bureaucracy that competes with itself for influence, including with its civilian leadership under Pezeshkian. As recently as Thursday, Pezeshkian suggested Iran could open itself up to even more inspections from the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. “They (can) come and inspect one hundred times more since we are not supposed to go after” a nuclear weapon, Pezeshkian told foreign diplomats. Iranian diplomats have long pointed to Khamenei’s preachings as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran won’t build an atomic bomb. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, it now enriches uranium to 60% purity — a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iranian officials increasingly suggest Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.” Earlier in the week, Trump also said that displaced Palestinians in Gaza could be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and proposed the U.S. take “ownership” in redeveloping the area into “the Riviera of the Middle East.” Khamenei appeared to reference Trump’s Gaza proposal in his remarks. “The Americans sit, redrawing the map of the world — but only on paper, as it has no basis in reality,” Khamenei said. “They make statements about us, express opinions and issue threats. If they threaten us, we will threaten them in return. If they act on their threats, we will act on ours. If they violate the security of our nation, we will, without a doubt, respond in kind.” Meanwhile, Iran’s Foreign Ministry separately criticized the U.S. Treasury’s move to levy sanctions Thursday against firms trading sanctioned Iranian crude oil to China. The Treasury described the firms as forming an “international network for facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars.” Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei called the Treasury’s decision “completely unjustified and contrary to international rules and regulations.” ___ Associated Press writers Amir Vahdat and Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.",Khamenei criticizes talks with US,Jon Gambrell,AP News,2025-02-07T08:08:42,2025-02-07T15:05:48,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-floats-who-withdrawal-after-trump-and-milei-exits/,"First the United States, then Argentina — now Hungary? Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s office said Thursday Hungary could withdraw from the World Health Organization. Trump ordered U.S. withdrawal almost immediately upon taking office in January, and was followed Wednesday by Argentinian President Javier Milei. Gergely Gulyás, the minister in charge of the Hungarian prime minister’s office, told reporters Thursday that “if the most powerful country in the world decides to leave an international organization, then I think the Hungarian government would act carefully if it were to consider whether it should not take this step.” “We may come to the conclusion that we do not have to do it, we may come to a different decision, of course, but it is certainly worth considering,” Gulyás said, since the “world's strongest democracy is leaving of its own free will.” Also on Thursday, the deputy speaker of Russia's parliament spoke in favor of an exit.  “It is time to thoroughly investigate WHO's activities in Russia. During the investigation, Russian membership should at least be suspended. Or, better still, we should say goodbye altogether,” Pyotr Tolstoy wrote on Telegram.  Tolstoy hails from President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party. Trump and his allies have previously accused the WHO of interfering with countries’ sovereignty, being unduly influenced by China, and bungling its Covid-19 response — all claims WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus flatly rejected in a speech to member countries on Monday. “As a U.N. agency, WHO is impartial and exists to serve all countries and all people,” Tedros said. When countries make requests that go beyond WHO’s mission to support global health, “we say no, politely,” he added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8jlm6rm9qo,"A state of emergency has been declared on the Greek island of Santorini after days of consecutive earthquakes. It comes after amagnitude 5.2 tremor was recorded at 21:09 local time (19:09 GMT) on Wednesday between the Greek islands of Amorgos and Santorini,making it the strongest in recent days. It is estimated to have occurred at a depth of 5km (3.1 miles). The decree will be in effect until 3 March to ""address the emergency needs and manage the consequences"", officials said. More than 11,000 people have already left Santorini, with around 7,000 departing by ferry and 4,000 by air. A 4.7 magnitude quake was also recorded south-west of Amorgos at 07:50 local time on Thursday, following 57 tremors between midnight and 06:30. Magnitude refers to the size of an earthquake, with increases marked as decimal points. A magnitude 6.0 and above is considered severe, where as a magnitude 5.2, the strongest experienced so far in the region, is considered moderate. So far no major damage has been reported on the island, but authorities are preparing in case a larger quake hits. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is expected to visit Santorini on Friday. Vasilis Karastathis, director of the Geodynamic Institute, told Greek state-owned broadcaster ERT News that ""seismicity continues at the same pace as in previous days, intense"". ""We have a fairly high number of earthquakes with magnitudes above 4,"" he said. ""We are still in the middle of the road. We have not seen any thinning, any sign that it is heading towards retreat."" Santorini welcomes millions of tourists annually, but it is currently low season, meaning local residents and workers make up the majority of evacuees. Due to the state of emergency, repairs to things like public roads and ports can skip usual bureaucratic requirements and begin immediately. ""We are in a particularly uncertain stage, where we cannot accurately determine the duration of the seismic swarm nor its exact origin,"" Costas Synolakis, a professor of natural disasters, told ERTNews. He said it is necessary to remain prepared for the possibility of a larger earthquake and a ""volcanic crisis"" like the one in Santorini. To cope with this, extra generators have arrived and a backup telecommunications station is being set up at Santorini City Hall. Islanders also fear of a tsunami, with makeshift defences built from sacks along Monolithos beach in Santorini, where the buildings are very close to the sea. All hospital employees are on standby to help those who have remained on the island with all leave and days off cancelled. Additional ambulance crews, police officers, soldiers and military vehicles have also arrived in Santorini, with medical personnel sent from Naxos, another island. Vassilis Kikilias, the climate and civil protection minister, said units of firefighters trained in natural disasters were being despatched to Santorini. Teams with special dogs and a mobile operations centre have also been sent to the island, while helicopters are on standby. Kikilias also said the coast guard and armed forces would be available to assist vulnerable people who wish to evacuate. Poor weather means the ferry from Santorini to Piraeus port near Athens is not operating. The adverse conditions are expected to continue over the coming days. Many travellers remain at Santorini's port to board emergency ferry routes that have been set up. Schools on Santorini - and other neighbouring islands including Anafi, Paros, Naxos and Mykonos - will remain closed until Friday, when authorities will make a decision about when they can re-open. Earlier on Wednesday, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis had struck an optimistic tone at a meeting of civil protection experts. ""All plans have been implemented. Forces have been moved to Santorini and the other islands, so that we are ready for any eventuality,"" he said. He asked the islanders to ""stay calm and cooperate with the authorities"". The Thira Chamber of Commerce earlier called for business on the island to be suspended and emergency support measures be taken in line with those during Covid-19. Watch: ""We can't take it anymore"" - people evacuate Santorini after days of tremors Santorini is on what is known as the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of islands created by volcanoes - but the last major eruption was in the 1950s. Greek authorities have said the recent tremors were related to tectonic plate movements, not volcanic activity. Scientists cannot predict the exact timing, size or location of earthquakes. But there are areas of the world where they are more likely to occur, which helps governments prepare. Earthquakes are the result of movement of tectonic plates in the earth's crust. Sometimes these plates lock together when they meet, which is called a plate boundary or a fault line. Santorini and the other Greek Islands are near such a line. Have you been affected by the earthquake? Get in touch. The quake damaged homes and public buildings, and caused widespread power cuts. The behaviour is known as an 'alert circle', a formation meant to protect elephant calves from threats. There are no reports of injuries or major damage after the quake struck on Monday morning. The UN received reports that Myanmar's military had conducted attacks, while the military accused rebels of the same. More than 3,000 people have been confirmed dead after last week's earthquake and the toll is expected to rise. Copyright 2025 BBC.

https://www.dw.com/en/slovak-government-teeters-as-more-mass-protests-planned/a-71523179,"Anti-government protests are expected to take place in more than
50 towns and cities across Slovakia on Friday.

The planned demonstrations are part of a series of protests that rapidly grew and spread after Prime Minister Robert Fico's December visit to Moscow, where he was pictured shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Fico's pro-Russian stance has provoked fears that he seeks to pull the country away from the European Union and NATO and towards the east.

The protests have also been fed by government policies that many feel are weakening democratic values in the country and an ugly and festering public spat with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The current turmoil is fueling a crisis within Slovakia's governing coalition and, with Fico appearing increasingly panicked, the threat of a government collapse is growing.

An unnerved prime minister

This is not the first time that Fico has faced such a concerted and major display of public anger. In 2018, he was ejected from a third term in the prime ministerial chair by massive demonstrations.

Aware that populist nationalism and pro-Russian rhetoric were the drivers of his return to power in late 2023, the combative premier has responded by seeking to expand support for his nominally left-leaning Smer party.

""Smer has lost a lot of moderate support, so
Fico is using extremist rhetoric and a pro-Russian stance to try to attract more radical voters, of which there are a fair number in Slovakia,"" Radoslav Stefancik, a political scientist at the University of Economics in Bratislava, told DW.

Fico's scare tactics

Declaring that his opponents are part of a foreign-led attempted coup, the premier last month stamped on an opposition bid to hold a no-confidence vote, seeking to intimidate both critics and disobedient partners within the ruling coalition.

He has since announced plans to push through anti-EU and anti-LGBTQ+ changes to the constitution. This response has only raised the level of alarm among Slovakia's pro-Western population and parties.

The government's media office did not respond to a request for comment.

Analysts suggest that Fico's scare tactics are unlikely to stop people from taking to the streets once again
on Friday. More than 100,000 people across the country rallied under the banner ""Slovakia is Europe"" on January 24.

Whether he will be able to enforce discipline among lawmakers from Smer's coalition partners — Hlas, a social democratic party that broke away from Smer in 2020, and the radical-right Slovak National Party (SNS) — is another matter.

Will the coalition hold?

Bogged down in crisis for months amid dysfunction and bickering over senior posts, the turbulence over foreign policy has helped to further threaten the coalition's majority, which is now razor-thin. Hoping to tip it over the edge, the opposition is again pushing for a no-confidence vote.

""Fico's coalition, which is damaging for Slovakia, is steadily deteriorating,"" Michal Simecka, leader of the main opposition Progressive Slovakia (PS) party, told DW. ""We're convinced that a political change is within reach.""

But for now, at least, analysts feel the coalition is likely to hold.

They note that while many members of the coalition may be disgruntled, they are not at present enthusiastic about risking their role in government, even if its incoherence and struggles to deal with crises in the budget or healthcare system are
on full display.

Erratic behavior and increasing extremism

""The turmoil being created by Fico appears something of a gambit to press his coalition partners to get back in line and allow him to reshuffle a government that is full of inexperienced people who are causing huge problems,"" Viera Zuborova at the Bratislava Policy Institute told DW.

However, the premier's increasing extremism is unsettling moderates, some of whom have stated that they will not stand by should Slovakia's membership of the EU or NATO be seriously questioned.

Fico's erratic behavior is another threat to government stability, with critics condemning his increasing aggression, paranoia and repetition of conspiracy theories.

More than 100 psychiatrists and psychologists signed an open letter last month expressing concern over Fico's mental health since an attempted assassination in May.

Fico has suggested that, having failed to kill him physically, the opposition was now attempting a political murder.

Uncertainty about what happens next

That leaves few expecting he will manage to hold the government together for long.

""It's not clear what exactly will happen, but I think we will have early elections at some point,"" Andrej Matisak, a senior editor at the Slovak daily newspaper Pravda told DW. ""The government's majority is now very shaky and I can't imagine they can govern for another two-and-a-half years.""

What could follow a government collapse is unclear, but few are optimistic.

Stefancik suggests that Fico's turn toward Moscow may partially be seen as a bid to secure assistance in the next election campaign, of the kind pro-Russian candidates are recently alleged to have received in elections in Romania and Moldova.

With Simecka's PS currently ahead in the polls with support of around 23% and Fico's Smer losing ground, the opposition parties might just be able to secure enough votes to form a government.

However, Slovaks well remember the last administration cobbled together by the fragmented liberal parties.

Squabbling and inept, its failures saw it fall apart, opening the door for Fico's unlikely return from the political wilderness about 18 months ago.

Deepening political crisis

If Slovakia does end up going to the polls, it's likely that Hlas would once again hold the key to the formation of a government, as it did in 2023. Hlas's founder, Peter Pellegrini, stepped down as party leader last year to become Slovak president.

But for many, Hlas has no clear-cut identity. While there are factions within the party that are genuinely progressive; others are just Smer in a slightly different guise.

""The opposition could try to persuade Hlas to swap sides to enjoy a better image both at home and abroad, but it's unlikely,"" says Zuborova. ""The party had the chance to do just that following the last election, but chose to side with Fico.""

All of this leaves Slovakia mired in political instability and facing an immediate future that looks far from bright.

""The country is heading towards a deepening political crisis, where Fico's coalition is increasingly unable to govern but is unwilling to give up power,"" says Andrius Tursa of Teneo Intelligence, a London-based risk consultancy. ""Meanwhile, extreme levels of social and political polarization will keep protest-related risks high.""

https://apnews.com/article/philippines-plane-crash-us-military-24ff90663ffec8033361d26fb9ac17db,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — One U.S. service member and three defense contractors were killed Thursday when a plane contracted by the U.S. military crashed in a rice field in the southern Philippines, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said. The aircraft was conducting a routine mission “providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support at the request of our Philippine allies,” the command said in a statement. It said the cause of the crash was under investigation. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines also confirmed the crash of a light plane in Maguindanao del Sur province. It did not immediately provide other details. The bodies of the four people were retrieved from the wreckage in Ampatuan town, said Ameer Jehad Tim Ambolodto, a safety officer of Maguindanao del Sur. Indo-Pacific Command said the names of the crew were being withheld pending family notifications. Windy Beaty, a provincial disaster-mitigation officer, told The Associated Press that she received reports that residents saw smoke coming from the plane and heard an explosion before the aircraft plummeted to the ground less than a kilometer (about half a mile) from a cluster of farmhouses. Nobody was reported injured on or near the crash site, which was cordoned off by troops, Beaty said. A water buffalo on the ground was killed as a result of the plane crash, local officials said. U.S. forces have been deployed in a Philippine military camp in the country’s south for decades to help provide advise and training to Filipino forces battling Muslim militants. The region is the homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic nation.","US service member, 3 contractors killed in surveillance mission plane crash in southern Philippines",,AP News,2025-02-06T12:05:25,2025-02-06T19:37:21,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250206-indonesia-backs-climate-deals-after-envoy-s-paris-skepticism,"Jakarta (AFP) â








































–Indonesia's environment ministry has backed Jakarta's participation in the landmark Paris climate deal after the country's climate envoy suggested the agreement was irrelevant given Washington's withdrawal.













































Issued on:06 - 09:13Modified:06 - 09:11 Indonesia's special envoy for climate change and energy, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, last week questioned why his country should continue participating in the deal to limit warming after President Donald Trump again withdrew from it.

""If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?"" he said, calling the issue ""a matter of justice.""

Hashim's office did not respond to requests for comment on the remarks.

But in a statement to AFP, the environment ministry backed the climate deal.

Indonesia ""needs to demonstrate its commitment to addressing global environmental impacts"", senior environment ministry official Ari Sudijanto said, listing ""benefits that Indonesia has gained"" as a signatory to climate deals including Paris.

""Indonesia has taken a major role in various efforts to mitigate climate change in the regional and global level,"" he added.

The ministry declined to directly answer whether Jakarta is considering leaving the deal, or if it endorsed Hashim's statement.

But Ari said ""participation in global agreements is beneficial for environmental and climate change control programs, strategies and policies in Indonesia.""

Coal-dependent Indonesia is one of the world's top emitters, but the country's new President Prabowo Subianto has pledged to phase out coal power in just 15 years.

The country has also pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, a decade earlier than previously planned.

A spokesperson for the presidential office did not respond to request for comment on Hashim's remarks.

The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to below two degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels and is seen as key to coordinating global action on climate change.

Environmentalists fear Trump's withdrawal will undermine global cooperation on reducing fossil fuel use and could embolden major polluters like China and India to weaken their commitments.

Argentina, under libertarian President Javier Milei, has already said it is ""re-evaluating"" its participation in the agreement.

Hashim's remarks had sparked alarm among environmental groups in Indonesia.

Uli Arta Siagian, a campaigner at climate group WALHI, called Hashim comments ""a step backwards in Indonesia's climate commitments.""

Uli told AFP that climate and environment skeptics in Indonesia's government had received a ""strong push"" from Trump's Paris withdrawal.

Norly Mercado, Asia regional director for the 350.org climate network, meanwhile warned Indonesia not to ""hide behind the US government's betrayal of global climate goals.""

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-february-06-2025/,"The Times of Israel liveblogged Thursday’s events as they happened. Lebanese media report that Israeli fighter jets carried out strikes in the Nabatieh area and the Beqaa Valley. Both areas are north of the Litani River, which Hezbollah is required to withdraw to under a ceasefire agreement. There is no immediate comment from the IDF on the reported strikes. Meeting with Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar in Ashdod Port, Italy’s top diplomat Antonio Tajani says his country will not work with UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. “We don’t want to work with UNRWA and we condemn the use of UNRWA offices as a prison for Israeli hostages,” says Tajani. The mother of freed hostage Emily Damari said last week that her daughter had been held at UNRWA facilities in Gaza. Sa’ar says at the joint press conference that the UN Human Rights Council “acted in the most outrageous way possible.” “They were biased, they were obsessive, you can say they were antisemites because they used double standards with regards to our state.” Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy Antonio Tajani: “We don’t want to work with UNRWA and we condemn the use of UNRWA offices as a prison for Israeli hostages” Thank you@Antonio_Tajanifor this decisive message!pic.twitter.com — Oren Marmorstein (@OrenMarmorstein)February 6, 2025 Sa’ar announced this week that Israel would no longer participate in the UNHRC, following the US’s withdrawal. Sa’ar hints that US President Donald Trump’s proposal for the Gaza Strip should be taken seriously. “Today, it is important to listen carefully to new ideas that have been proposed and to think outside the box,” he says. “Gaza is a failed experiment. It failed under Egyptian sovereignty. It failed when handed to the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo Accords. Ever since we saw terrorism rise. It has certainly failed under Hamas,” he argues. “Gaza, in its current state, has no future.” “We must try to find a different solution,” Sa’ar says. “We must take a new approach.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says that Gaza currently is “not habitable” due to dangers, such as unexploded weapons, and that people will have to live elsewhere while the area is rebuilt. Rubio, answering a reporter’s question during a visit to the Dominican Republic, encourages other countries to step forward and offer to help rebuild Gaza, but does not say whether Palestinians would be able to return to the area under a proposal by US President Donald Trump to take over and develop the Gaza Strip. “I think that’s just a realistic reality, that in order to fix a place like that, people are going to have to live somewhere else in the interim,” Rubio says. He says Trump’s controversial remarks were aimed in part to encourage other countries that “have both the economic and technological capacity” to help as well with rebuilding. “President Trump has offered to go in and be a part of that solution. If some other countries are willing to step forward and do it themselves, that would be great, but no one seems to be rushing forward to do that,” he says. He adds that “countries in the region
cwho express a lot of concern about the Palestinian people” should “find a solution and answer to their problem.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has started. Netanyahu and Johnson are expected to give statements after the meeting. The Prime Minister’s Office says that during a meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and bipartisan senate leadership, the US lawmakers expressed “unqualified support for the Prime Minister and Israel, and praised Israel’s achievements in the war.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tells the senators that “Iran must be prevented from obtaining nuclear weapons and that Hamas in Gaza must be eliminated.” The senators promised to pass a law punishing the International Criminal Court, says the PMO. Among those in attendance were Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has fiercely criticized the Israeli premier in the past. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report. Former defense minister Yoav Gallant pushes back against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s assertion that attacking Hezbollah in October 2023, as Gallant had proposed, would have been “a horrible mistake.” In a post on X, Gallant also dismisses Netanyahu’s claim that there were only around 150 booby-trapped beepers in Hezbollah hands in October 2023 “as opposed to thousands that we accumulated” in the months leading up to the September 2024 pager attack. “The pager operation was prepared years before the war and was ready for activation on October 11,” he writes. “Contrary to what was said, thousands of pagers were in the hands of the terrorists by the time I suggested attacking Hezbollah.” He asserts that had the plan been activated back in October 2023, the damage caused by the pagers would have been secondary to the damage caused by the walkie-talkie devices, which were also rigged with explosives. While dozens of Hezbollah operatives were killed and thousands more were wounded in the September 16-17 pager and walkie-talkie attacks, far more were put out of commission by the pager blasts than by the walkie-talkies. The reason for this, Gallant writes on X, was because by September 2024, “the vast majority of walkie-talkies were in warehouses, and their explosion caused no damage.” ×

93 Yoav Gallant (@yoavgallant)February 6, 2025 Speaking to the friendly Channel 14 network, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that there were only around 150 booby-trapped beepers in Hezbollah hands in October 2023 “as opposed to thousands that we accumulated” in the ensuing months. Netanyahu explains that he blocked then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s October 11 proposal to take out Hezbollah’s rockets and leadership because it would be “a horrible mistake” to open a two-front war so soon after the Hamas attacks of October 7. The Health Ministry says that five toddlers in Rehovot have been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, likely contracted from an employee at their nursery. The children and the employee are in good condition. An epidemiological investigation shows that the infected employee was the source of transmission. The ministry says that it immediately took steps to inform parents about necessary precautions and medical protocols. Health officials emphasize that the risk of tuberculosis transmission from toddlers is relatively low because the coughing mechanism in young children is not sufficiently developed to spread the bacteria. Health authorities are closely monitoring the situation and will keep parents informed. The government on Sunday will discuss the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the October 7, 2023, Hamas terror assault, but will not make any decisions one way or another, Hebrew media outlets report. The meeting is being convened only due to a December 2024 ruling from the High Court of Justice, which ordered the government to hold a hearing on the establishment of a state commission of inquiry within 60 days. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of establishing any inquiry before the end of the war, and critics have alleged he seeks to establish a panel with fewer powers than a state commission, fearing it would implicate him in the disaster. Last month, the coalition defeated an opposition bill calling for the establishment of a state commission by a vote of 45-53. While in Washington this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a plan to end the war in Gaza and release senior Palestinian security prisoners in exchange for the exile of senior Hamas leaders from Gaza, according to the Walla news outlet, citing senior US officials. The plan would allow the sides to move to the second phase of the hostage release deal, the oulet reports, adding that Hamas would also give up civil control of the Strip. Netanyahu told US officials that he wants to extend the first stage of the deal, says the report, adding that Israeli officials believe that this could lead to the release of only 2 or 3 additional hostages. Netanyahu’s spokesman denies the report, saying on X, “It never happened. The Prime Minister did not present any plan for the second stage.” Israel will not necessarily send a delegation to negotiations on the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal in Doha tomorrow, the Israel Hayom newspaper reports,
citing a source in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s entourage. The delegation, if it flies to Qatar, will be a working-level team, according to the Prime Minister’s Office. Netanyahu’s office said earlier this week that the delegation would depart Friday, following the premier’s meetings with senior members of US President Donald Trump’s administration in Washington. Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana announces he will boycott newly elected Supreme Court President Isaac Amit’s swearing-in ceremony at the President’s Residence next week. In a letter to President Isaac Herzog, Ohana complains about the court’s January 2024 ruling striking down a quasi-constitutional Basic Law that constituted a key component of the government’s judicial overhaul agenda. This ruling meant that the judiciary had “expropriated from the Knesset the sovereignty that was entrusted to it” by the citizens of Israel, he writes. In addition, Ohana slams what he claims was the “fundamentally crooked selection process” that led to Amit’s appointment. “As Knesset Speaker, I cannot accept these dangerous and anti-democratic processes. Therefore, at this stage, I will not accept the invitation, and I will not participate in events of the judicial authority, including the upcoming inauguration ceremony,” Ohana writes. Justice Minister Yariv Levin had previously announced that he would also not attend the ceremony, after boycotting the vote in which Amit was chosen. Hebrew media has reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will also not attend the event. In a statement, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid insists that Levin and Ohana’s boycott of the event “only humiliates them and their government.” “Judge Amit was legally elected, the members of the Judicial Selection Committee were legally elected. There is no legal significance to the absence of Levin and Ohana; it is simply a basic lack of respect for the state, its laws, its institutions and the tradition of Israel,” he says, adding that he plans on attending the ceremony. Defense Minister Israel Katz held an assessment this evening with defense officials regarding plans to allow Palestinians to “voluntarily” leave the Gaza Strip, as per recent statements by US President Donald Trump. Katz met with outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, director general of the ministry and incoming chief of staff Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, and several other top officers. “I instructed the IDF to prepare a plan that would allow any resident in Gaza that would be interested, to leave for anywhere in the world that would agree to absorb them,” he says in a video statement. “The plan will include options to leave through the land crossings and special arrangements for exit through the sea and the air,” Katz adds. A small number of Palestinians are currently able to leave the Strip via the Rafah Crossing with Egypt amid the ongoing ceasefire. During the fighting, Israel facilitated the exit of dozens of sick Palestinians via the Kerem Shalom Crossing and enabled them to reach the United Arab Emirates for treatment. US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order later today sanctioning the International Criminal Court for targeting the US and its allies, including Israel, a White House official says. The official says the order will put financial and visa-related sanctions on individuals and families who assist the ICC in its investigations of US citizens or allies. The ICC issued arrest warrants in November for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes in Gaza, amid the war against the Hamas terror group. Israel has strongly rejected the accusations. On his first day back in the White House last month, Trump signed an executive order reinstating an earlier order that could serve as a legal basis for future sanctions against the ICC and its personnel. The US House of Representatives also voted last month to impose sanctions on the ICC, although the legislation has yet to be okayed in the Senate. Posing with Senate leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is asked whether “US troops are needed in Gaza to make President Trump’s plan feasible?” “No,” he answers. The Prime Minister’s Office acknowledges that Benjamin Netanyahu gave a golden pager as a gift to US President Donald Trump during their meeting on Tuesday. The gift “symbolizes the Prime Minister’s decision that led to a turning point in the war and the starting point for breaking the will of the terrorist organization Hezbollah,” says Netanyahu’s office. The operation “expresses the power, technological superiority and cunning of Israel against its enemies,” according to the PMO. On Capitol Hill in Washington, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). He then meets with GOP Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. In remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, US President Donald Trump praises former hostage Noa Argamani — who is in attendance — for the “unwavering strength, and courage and faith” that kept her going throughout her captivity in Gaza. “For 245 harrowing days, Noa showed unwavering strength and courage and faith as she endured the unendurable,” Trump says. “But by the grace of God, she was rescued by the Israel Defense Forces and now she’s come back to pray with us this morning.” “You’re really an inspiration, Noa, to all of us,” Trump says, adding that it is “such an honor” to have her join the event. ð

https://www.politico.eu/article/baltics-brace-cyberattacks-depart-russian-electricity-grid-brell/,"Europe’s Baltics are bracing for cyberattacks as they plan to decouple from a Soviet-era joint power grid with Russia and Belarus this weekend. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia will flip the switch on Feb. 9, disconnecting themselves from a regional electricity grid known as BRELL, and will switch to a European Union regional network instead. The move has been years in the making — but now that the time has come, security officials are bracing for retaliation from Moscow. “Estonia has prepared for many possible risk scenarios regarding our departure from BRELL, including cyberthreats,” Gert Auväärt, head of Estonia’s Cyber Security Centre, told POLITICO in a written response. He said the country is ready to call in its cyber reserve, which includes the Estonian Defence League’s cyber unit, a volunteer group of cyber defenders. His agency has advised energy companies on how to prepare and has experts on hand “24” in case of a serious incident, Auväärt said, adding Estonia is working with Latvia and Lithuania on the threat. Žygimantas Vaičiūnas, Lithuania’s energy minister, said in an interview he expects the switch to be a “smooth process,” but that authorities are nonetheless “prepared for even the worst-case scenarios on the technical level.” A spokesperson for Lithuania’s Energy Ministry said it has taken “additional actions and plans to increase our preparedness.” Erkki Sapp, member of the management board of Elering, Estonia’s state-owned gas and power grid operator, said it had taken extra precautions such as removing virtual private network (VPN) access for external companies that maintain its systems. The Estonian state “has prepared and takes this very seriously,” he said.  It’s not just cyberattacks the Baltics are preparing for: Sapp said the grid operator was “limiting access to [their] premises,” while Vaičiūnas added Lithuania had set up new “anti-drone systems and ... physical protection barriers” around key energy infrastructure. Baltic energy operators “should absolutely batten down the proverbial hatches,” said Joe Marshall, senior security strategist at Cisco’s Talos cyber threat intelligence division.  “Russia is one of the few nation states on Earth that has actively meddled in the power grids of another sovereign nation,” Marshall said. “They clearly have the means, the capability, the knowledge to conduct [such] a cyber operation … that [fact] can never be overlooked, unfortunately.” Russian state-linked hacking groups have ramped up cyberattacks against Ukraine’s energy system since Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022, but lately have also extended that campaign to the rest of Europe, especially the eastern and Baltic countries, cyber researchers have flagged.  Moscow has even deployed one of its most elite hacking groups, known as Sandworm, to that task, according to Google. “Actors like Sandworm who have taken down the grid in Ukraine have also been probing the rest of Eastern Europe for years ... They shouldn’t be taken lightly, especially now,” said John Hultquist, chief analyst at Mandiant, Google’s cyber defense and threat intelligence firm. As the Baltics take a deep breath before the plunge, they are also battling suspected Russian sabotage of subsea energy and data cables in the Baltic Sea. At a press conference this month announcing a new NATO program to tackle that problem, Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal said he suspected the ramped-up attacks on those cables are Russia’s way of reminding its Baltic neighbors that, despite their departure from the electricity system, it still looms large. It “probably could be [the] intended message that the Baltics and Nordics do not live well and do not work well without Russia’s embrace,” he said.  “We will decouple anyway … because Russia is not a reliable partner.”  This article has been updated to reflect the switch will happen the night of Feb. 8 to Feb. 9.",Baltics brace for cyberattacks as they depart Russian electricity grid,"Sam Clark, Victor Jack",POLITICO,2025-02-06T03:34:04,2025-02-06T11:56:46,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-chagos-islands-uk-handover-keir-starmer-military-base-white-house-africa/,"LONDON — A tiny group of islands more than 6,000 miles from the U.K. has given Keir Starmer’s government an almighty headache that shows little sign of easing. Just three months into power, Labour pulled off what it billed as a diplomatic coup: ending a long-running dispute over the status of the Chagos Islands, one of Britain’s final imperial possessions, while protecting a joint U.K.-U.S. military base there for decades to come. But the praise hasn’t exactly come flooding in. Britain relinquishing control of what’s often dubbed its “last African colony” to Mauritius has generated deep opposition, mistrust and disappointment from almost every direction — including members of the Trump administration. The British government is currently waiting for the White House to approve the agreement, amid publicly expressed concern from some in President Donald Trump’s team that the deal provides a strategic boost to China. In the meantime, opposition Conservatives, who started the negotiations in 2022, charge that Labour has sold out a territory vital for Britain’s geopolitical interests. Complicating matters further, the Mauritian government has changed since the announcement — and now wants more money to make the deal stick. It’s prompted briefing and counter-briefing from the two sides about what’s actually being promised. And all the while, expelled Chagossians say they are being sidelined. Forgotten islanders The U.K. agreed last October to hand Mauritius sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago, made up of more than 60 islands in the Indian Ocean that were retained by the U.K. when Mauritius itself won independence from its former colonial rulers in 1968. The decision came after a non-binding ruling from the International Court of Justice upped the pressure on the U.K. to allow Chagossians — removed between 1968 and 1973 to make way for a base on the island of Diego Garcia — to return, and end years of legal uncertainty. As part of the deal, Mauritius can resettle its own residents on any island apart from Diego Garcia, with a “trust fund” set aside for Chagossians. Yet groups representing Chagossians feel short-changed. Many point out that they are historically and culturally distinct from Mauritians, with their own language — and believe giving Mauritius control of resettlement ignores this. “We feel powerless,” said Frankie Bontemps, acting chair of Chagossian Voices, a community organization campaigning for the indigenous rights and self determination of Chagossians. The deal includes visits by Chagossians to the archipelago — but only if arranged by the U.K. and Mauritius. The group wants all Chagossians to have the right to return to the islands, regardless of their current location and citizenship. Under the arrangement, those returning would be governed by Mauritius, rather than enjoying their own sovereignty. Bontemps lamented a deal that appeared to have been cooked up first by the Conservatives, and then by Labour, without the active involvement of displaced islanders. “Every time we asked questions about the ongoing negotiation, they said they can’t reveal anything, because this was being discussed between two governments,” he said. Labour MP Peter Lamb, whose constituency includes a high number of Chagossians, was withering about the agreement, saying the U.K. shouldn’t “bargain away” the islands.  Bontemps’ mother was born on Diego Garcia, while he was born in Mauritius and moved to the U.K. in 2006. “We were treated like second-class citizens” in Mauritius, Bontemps said. “They came over here because we don’t want our children to face the same kind of discrimination,” he said. Chagossian Voices notes that a majority of Mauritians are of Indian origin — whereas Chagossians are of African origin — and says they were not made to feel welcome in exile after their removal. There’s deep mistrust of the Mauritian government, too — and a feeling that both the U.K. and Mauritius have spent too long “talking about what’s best for them.” “I feel like history is repeating itself,” Bontemps said. The Independent reported late last month that Chagossian Voices has sought legal advice and is now willing to take the British government to court to halt the deal — offering up another tangle for Starmer as he tries to get the deal over the line. Ultimately, Bontemps would like the Chagossian diaspora to determine their own future on the islands. “If they want Mauritian sovereignty, U.K. sovereignty, or independence … I will gladly agree with that,” he said. “Decisions being taken behind closed doors … that’s appalling.  Waiting for the White House All the while, the British government is having to read the runes from Team Trump on the deal — and counter claims that it’s opening up a backdoor to to Chinese influence. Trump’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio told POLITICO before taking up the post that the deal poses “a serious threat” to U.S. national security and “critical U.S. military posture.” Robert Wilkie, who headed up Trump’s Department of Defense transition team and used to be Secretary for Veterans Affairs, called it a “calamitous decision” that wasn’t “thinking about the long term.”  The U.K. initially hoped to get the deal — which was approved by the Biden administration — over the line before Trump entered office, but ultimately conceded the new White House would need to consider it. It’s the fate of Diego Garcia, the joint U.S.-U.K. base, that’s most animating Starmer’s critics. The islands give the U.K. and U.S. access to “choke points,” such as the Bab-el-Mandeb strait between Yemen and Eritrea, that relinquishing would be “stupid,” argued former Security Minister Alan West, an ex-navy chief.  And China, the world’s second largest economy, has significant relations with Mauritius. “Recent years have demonstrated beyond doubt China’s willingness to use their leverage to get what they want from strategic partners,” said Luke de Pulford, executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China. His group brings together politicians concerned about the West’s relationship with China, and its members have included Rubio. Indeed, Chinese support for Mauritius runs deep: A major airport there was completed in 2013 with a £197 million loan from Beijing, while the i newspaper reported that China assisted with constructing the state broadcaster’s headquarters, a dam and sports complex. Mauritius was also the first African nation to sign and activate a free trade agreement with Beijing.  “Is it conceivable that Mauritius, if it finds itself more under the control of the Chinese Communist Party than it even is now, could act on behalf of the Chinese to just simply break international law?” asked De Pulford. “Yes, it’s perfectly conceivable.  Some see echoes, too, of Britain’s handover of another imperial possession: Hong Kong, which was returned to China in 1997. The treaty sealing that deal promised “ one country, two systems” until 2047, meaning Hong Kong would retain freedom of speech, an independent judiciary and multiple political parties.  Yet Beijing undermined this by ultimately treating Hong Kong like the mainland. Large protests in 2019 against an extradition bill led to the extremely restrictive National Security Law in 2020, which purported to target secession, subversion and terrorism. “All the wishes of Hong Kongers for democracy have been crushed,” said Sari Arho Havrén, a Royal United Services Institute think tank associate fellow. Back home, Starmer’s government has argued that international opinion made action on the Chagos Islands inescapable — but his domestic critics, including Brexiteer and Trump ally Nigel Farage, aren’t buying it. “When the Americans wake up to the fact that this has been done wholly unnecessarily, I wouldn’t be surprised if we find ourselves together with the European Union in their tariff regime,” Farage charged in the Commons Wednesday. Starmer “has the audacity to tell the British people they will foot the bill and pay for the indignity of his surrender of the Chagos Islands, as he isolates the new U.S. administration by bending the knee to Mauritius and emboldening our enemies with his disastrous surrender deal,” said Tory Shadow Foreign Secretary Priti Patel. The government points to an International Court of Justice advisory opinion from 2019, which found Britain’s ownership of the islands violated international law, something the U.N. General Assembly endorsed. Two years later, the U.N.’s maritime law tribunal reached the same conclusion. In the post-Brexit world, the government wants Britain to be a global player — and argues that being seen to uphold international law is key. It points out that the agreement includes a lease to keep the crucial military base operational under U.K. control for at least 99 years. Yet West is not sold on the idea Britain needed to act so swiftly over an advisory opinion — and isn’t buying the fine print. “I’m not convinced that we’ve got security of this base for 99 years,” he warned. And he added: “We’re sleepwalking into danger if we don’t get this sorted out.”",Britain’s handover of the Chagos Islands is pleasing nobody,Noah Keate,POLITICO,2025-02-06T03:03:00,2025-02-06T03:03:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.rferl.org/a/pakistan-sets-deadline-for-west-to-relocate-afghan-refugees/33303186.html,"ISLAMABAD -- Afghan journalist Mahmood Kochai and his family had plane tickets to the United States, where they hoped to make a fresh start after spending more than three years in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. But their travel plans were canceled after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration announced that the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) would be suspended for at least three months starting on January 27. Kochai is among the thousands of Afghans who had been approved to resettle in the United States. Once the family of five -- Kochai, his wife, their daughter, son, and daughter-in-law -- were cleared to take their flights, he resigned from his job with the Afghanistan International news channel. Their temporary visas in Pakistan were to expire on February 5, and they say they now have no place to go. ""Everything is going from bad to worse,"" Kochai told RFE on February 4. ""Afghan refugees in Pakistan are caught between a rock and a hard place: The [Pakistani] police are chasing us out of their country; it's not safe for us to return to Afghanistan, and we cannot go to other countries."" Adding to the Afghan refugees' plight, Pakistan has decided to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting resettlement in the West if the prospective host countries don't relocate them by March 31, a source close to the government told RFE The decision was made at a cabinet meeting on January 30, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. The Voice of America and the Associated Press also reported on the decision, citing unnamed sources. If implemented, the decision will affect Afghans in Pakistan who are seeking asylum in third countries because of their affiliation with U.S. and NATO forces and other Western and international organizations. Tens of thousands of at-risk Afghans left for neighboring Pakistan fearing retribution after the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, following the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces. Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan recently said that nearly 80,000 Afghan refugees have left Pakistan to be resettled in various countries, while about 40,000 are still in Pakistan. That includes some 15,000 Afghans waiting to be approved for resettlement to the United States. Left In Limbo Journalist Ezzatullah Mahjur is waiting for a visa through the Special Visa Program (SIV) that has been available for Afghans who worked with the U.S. military as translators between the U.S.-led invasion in 2001 and the withdrawal in 2021. He is hopeful the refugee resettlement process will eventually resume. ""Since the suspension of flights, some people who have gotten visas through the SIV have tried to reach the United States at their own expense. But some of them were turned back from Dubai, and I know at least one person who was turned away from a Washington airport,"" Mahjur told RFE on February 4. It is not clear if the Trump administration will resume the resettlement program. In hisJanuary 20 order, Trump said the secretaries of homeland security and state must submit a report every 90 days ""regarding whether resumption of entry of refugees into the United States under the USRAP would be in the interests of the United States."" Beside those waiting for relocation to the West, Pakistan also hosts about 1.45 million Afghan citizens registered as refugees with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. Their stay in Pakistan has been extended until June. Some 800,000 Afghans have either been deported or returned voluntarily to their home county since Pakistan began a major crackdown on refugees in November 2023. Pakistan continues to track down and deport Afghans who are neither registered with the UNHCR nor awaiting resettlement to a third country.

https://www.politico.eu/article/us-politics-germany-eu-europe-donald-trump-friedrich-merz-white-house/,"Friedrich Merz, the frontrunner to become Germany’s next leader, is “highly concerned” about recent developments in the United States under Donald Trump’s second presidency. The German chancellor candidate told a rally in Singen on Wednesday night that “this is no longer the America we used to know,” amid the Trump administration’s major overhauls of the federal government. “The way officials, the Department of Justice, the public prosecutors’ offices, the way they’re all being thrown out, the way they’re pardoning people who have been sentenced to years in prison, that will have consequences for America,” Merz cautioned. Merz’s warning comes amid a whirlwind of personnel and agency slashes both within the U.S. federal government and to foreign aid since Trump took office. Since assuming the presidency, Trump’s administration has sent mass emails offering “deferred resignations” to all federal workers, sacked multiple federal watchdogs, and gotten rid of dozens of prosecutors who were involved in criminal cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack. The country has also frozen foreign aid and announced moves to put nearly all staff members at the U.S. Agency for International Development on paid leave. Trump has also announced ambitions to take control of the Gaza Strip, of Greenland and of the Panama Canal, not ruling out the use of military force.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p6d48ywjo,"Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio has said Rome had no choice but to release a Libyan war crimes suspect due ""errors and inaccuracies"" in an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Osama Almasri Najim, head of Libya's judicial police, was apprehended in Turin on 19 January. Two days later, he was released and flown back to Tripoli on an Italian air force plane. Mr Najim faces various charges including murder, rape, and torture linked to his role at Tripoli's Mitiga detention centre, and his release drew condemnation from opposition parties and NGOs. Addressing the Italian parliament on Wednesday, Carlo Nordio said the warrant that led to Mr Najim's detention was riddled with ""inaccuracies, omissions, discrepancies and contradictory conclusions"" which meant the Libyan citizen could not be held in jail. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said Mr Najim was expelled as he was a ""national security risk"". Images shared by Libyan media showing a jubilant crowd welcoming Mr Najim back circulated widely on Italian media. The ICC has demanded an explanation from the Italian authorities. Elly Schlein, leader of the opposition Democratic Party (PD), accused Nordio of speaking not as a government minister but as a ""defence lawyer for a torturer"". Last week, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni disclosed that she, Nordio and Piantedosi were under investigation in connection with Mr Najim's release. A special court that handles cases involving ministers has begun an investigation. David Yambio, a 27-year-old from South Sudan who says he was abused in Tripoli's Mitiga prison, told the BBC that Italy was ""complicit in the atrocities taking place in Libya"". He says he first encountered Mr Najim after he was caught at sea while trying to cross the Mediterranean on a boat and was returned to Libya. After he was forced to join a militia – which he says was ""a pure nightmare"" – Mr Yambio ended up in Mitiga, where he says he suffered months of torture. He also said he saw Mr Najim abuse other migrants. ""The injustice we suffered, and how Italy became complicit in our eyes, is clear. They took justice away from us."" ""Our torturer was in Italy, he was arrested, and then he was smuggled back to Libya,"" Mr Yambio added. As a signatory to the ICC, Italy is legally bound to execute the court's warrants. But critics suggest Italy's decision to free Mr Najim may have been influenced by its political and business ties with Libya. In 2017, the centre-left government of Paolo Gentiloni forged a deal with Tripoli that saw Italy pay the Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant boats before they reach Italian shores. NGOs have consistently criticised this policy, which they say exposes migrants to dire conditions in Libyan detention centres. The case has now dominated Italian headlines for weeks. Yet it is unlikely the investigation into Meloni, Nordio and Piantedosi will yield any meaningful consequences, given the government's solid parliamentary majority. Last week, Meloni suggested that the investigation was part of a politically motivated attack from the left and said she would not be ""blackmailed or intimidated"". But some commentators believe that Libya's ability to leverage its relationship with Rome highlights Italy's vulnerability on migration – one of Meloni's flagship issues. ""While Meloni insists she is not susceptible to blackmail from the judiciary, she is highly vulnerable to Libya, given her fixation on migration,"" said Nathalie Tocci, director of Rome's Institute for International Affairs. She added that the issue had been ""weaponised and exploited"" by Libya. ""The implicit message is: either you release Mr Najim or we will let the migrant boats through."" Libya plays a key role in the success of Meloni's Mattei Plan - an ambitious set of policies that aims to boost European co-operation with Africa in exchange for curbing irregular migration. ""The question of Libya is and remains a matter of... national security, meaning the safety of all citizens,"" former interior minister Marco Minniti told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. ""A large part of national security is played out beyond national borders."" For Mr Yambio and other survivors of the atrocities that Mr Najim is accused of, the release of the man they say tortured them is ""a deep betrayal"". In a letter to Giorgia Meloni, they called for an end to the Italy-Libya migration agreement, as well as the release of those still detained in Libyan camps. ""We are witnesses of so many crimes that Mr Najim is responsible for,"" Mr Yambio said.","Libyan war crimes suspect freed because of errors in ICC warrant, Italy says",Davide Ghiglione,BBC News,2025-02-05T19:16:28,2025-02-05T19:16:28,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyrxz4k6zo,"More than 100 female prisoners were raped and then burned alive during a jailbreak in the Congolese city of Goma, according to the UN. Hundreds of prisoners broke out of Munzenze prison last Monday, after fighters from the M23 rebel group began to take over the city. Between 165 and 167 women were assaulted by male inmates during the jailbreak, an internal UN document seen by the BBC says. The report states that most of the women were killed after the inmates set fire to the prison. The BBC has not been able to verify the reports. Goma, a major city of more than a million people, was captured after the Rwanda-backed M23 executed a rapid advance through eastern DR Congo. The city was plunged into chaos, with bodies lying in the streets and missiles reportedly flying over residential homes. Footage from last week's jailbreak showed people fleeing from the building as smoke rose in the background. Heavy gunfire could also be heard. In a separate video, people believed to be the escaped prisoners, filed through Goma's streets. What's the fighting in DR Congo all about? Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo The UN says at least 2,900 people were killed during the fighting, with 2,000 bodies buried and another 900 still in the city's morgues. Earlier this week, the rebels announced a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds. However, the M23 launched a new offensive on Wednesday, sources say, reportedly capturing the mining town of Nyabibwe. Nyabibwe is about 100 km (60 miles) from Bukavu - the east's second-largest city, and the reported target of the rebels' most recent advance. The Congolese authorities have enlisted hundreds of civilian volunteers to help defend Bukavu. Meanwhile, Malawi has announced it will start preparations for a withdrawal of its peacekeeping forces from the country. This follows the killing of three of its soldiers in the fighting around Goma. They were part of a southern African force, led by South Africa. Although 14 South Africans have been killed, President Cyril Ramaphosa has vowed to keep his forces in the country. Back in Goma, w h ere residents are adapting to life under the M23, there are fears of a cholera outbreak.

https://apnews.com/article/rubio-immigration-guatemala-trump-border-deportation-f928f64eec96b46a880069cbd5580d34,"GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — President Donald Trump’s top diplomat and his main spokesperson on Wednesday walked back the idea that he wants the permanent relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, after American allies and even Republican lawmakers rebuffed his suggestion that the U.S. take “ownership” of the territory. Trump on Tuesday had called for “permanently” resettling Palestinians from war-torn Gaza and left open the door to deploying American troops there as part of a massive rebuilding operation. But Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said he only sought to move the roughly 1.8 million Gazans temporarily to allow for reconstruction. Even that proposal has drawn criticism from Palestinians, who are worried they may never be allowed back in if they flee, and from the Arab nations that Trump has called on to take them in. Rubio, on his first foreign trip as secretary of state, described Trump’s proposal as a “very generous” offer to help with debris removal and reconstruction of the enclave following 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. “In the interim, obviously people are going to have to live somewhere while you’re rebuilding it,” Rubio said in a news conference in Guatemala City. Some Republican senators defended President Trump’s suggestions about Gaza on Wednesday, while at least one Democrat said Trump’s words are meant to be a distraction as he takes heat for Elon Musk’s involvement in digging into the work of federal agencies. Leavitt said in a briefing with reporters in Washington that Gaza is “a demolition site” and referenced footage of the devastation. “The president has made it clear that they need to be temporarily relocated out of Gaza,” she said, calling it currently “an uninhabitable place for human beings” and saying it would be “evil to suggest that people should live in such dire conditions.” Their comments contradicted Trump, who said Tuesday night, “If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what’s happening in Gaza.” He added that he envisioned “long-term” U.S. ownership of a redevelopment of the territory, which sits along the Mediterranean Sea. In a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Pentagon on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the military is “prepared to look at all options” for rebuilding Gaza. “We look forward to working with our allies, our counterparts, both diplomatically and militarily, to look at all options,” Hegseth said. In an interview later Wednesday with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Netanyahu reiterated his praise for Trump: “It’s a remarkable idea and I think it should be really pursued. Examined, pursued and done, because I think it will create a different future for everyone.” Egypt, Jordan and other U.S. allies in the Mideast have cautioned Trump that relocating Palestinians from Gaza would threaten Mideast stability, risk expanding the conflict and undermine a decades-long push by the U.S. and its allies for a two-state solution. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry issued a sharply worded reaction to Trump, noting its long call for an independent Palestinian state was a “firm, steadfast and unwavering position.” Saudi Arabia has been in negotiations with the U.S. over a deal to diplomatically recognize Israel in exchange for a security pact and other terms. “The duty of the international community today is to work to alleviate the severe human suffering endured by the Palestinian people, who will remain committed to their land and will not budge from it,” the Saudi statement said. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican and a Trump ally, called it “problematic.” “The idea of Americans going in on the ground in Gaza is a non starter for every senator,” the South Carolina lawmaker told reporters Wednesday. “So I would suggest we go back to what we’ve been trying to do which is destroy Hamas and find a way for the Arab world to take over Gaza and the West Bank, in a fashion that would lead to a Palestinian state that Israel can live with.” Rubio insisted that Trump’s position “was not meant as a hostile move.” “What he’s very generously has offered is the ability of the United States to go in and help with debris removal, help with munitions removal, help with reconstruction, the rebuilding homes and businesses and things of this nature so that then people can move back in,” Rubio said. Still, the White House said Trump was ruling out sending U.S. dollars to aid in the reconstruction of Gaza. But Leavitt, like Trump, refused to rule out sending American troops into Gaza, saying of Trump, “he wants to preserve that leverage in negotiations.” The Palestinians, Arab nations and others have rejected even a temporary relocation from Gaza, which would run counter to decades of U.S. policy calling for the creation of a Palestinian state with no further displacement of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank. The proposals also appear to trash months of negotiations by the Biden administration to draft a “day after” plan for the reconstruction and governance of Gaza. President Joe Biden had tried to lock in that plan — which calls for joint governance of the territory by the Palestinian Authority under U.N. stewardship and a multi-national peacekeeping force — before leaving office by inviting Trump’s main Mideast envoy into final talks over a Gaza ceasefire. ___ Miller reported from Washington.

Yoon, as well as Noh Sang-won, a former commander of the Defense Intelligence Command (DIC), and former DIC Colonel Kim Yong-gun did not appear for the parliamentary hearing at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, south of the capital. Noh is accused of discussing martial law operation plans with former and incumbent military intelligence officers at a burger franchise in Ansan, southwest of Seoul, two days before the plans were executed and on Dec. 3, the day of their imposition. Earlier in the day, the committee members also visited the Seoul Dongbu Detention Center in eastern Seoul, to hold a similar hearing against former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who is now arrested and indicted for charges of insurrection related to Yoon's brief martial law bid. Kim refused to appear for the hearing, citing the need to prepare for his trial and meet with his legal team. The ruling People Power Party boycotted the on-site investigations in protest of Yoon being selected as a witness. The committee will visit a detention center of the Capital Defense Command to meet with Yeo In-hyung, former head of the Defense Counterintelligence Command.

https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-lammy-uk-98d5d741bee9481ea4c2f49ea4f636e7,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine wants to collaborate with partner countries on postwar projects worth billions of dollars not just in mining rare earth elements, but also in energy and construction sectors to help rebuild the country, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Wednesday. Sybiha responded to comments by President Donald Trump who said Monday that he wanted to gain access to Ukraine’s valuable rare earth materials as a condition for continuing support for its war against Russia. Ukrainian officials have said Russia wants to get its hands on Ukraine’s vast natural resources. Kyiv intends to offer “guarantees of the presence of major businesses in Ukraine and the vested interests of our closest allies — the United States — in developing these (rare earth) deposits and ensuring their protection,” the foreign minister said. But cooperation should not be limited to rare earth materials, Sybiha said in a news conference alongside visiting U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Ukraine has “huge potential” to become a guarantor of energy security in Europe by buying liquefied natural gas from the United States and storing it in its massive underground tanks for later distribution, he said. Sybiha also said there was “joint interest” from Ukrainian and American businesses in the postwar reconstruction of Ukraine, estimated to cost more than $400 billion. “This will be one of the largest projects of this century and, accordingly, one of the largest opportunities for our allies.” Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said in an interview broadcast Tuesday night that the war has killed 45,100 Ukrainian troops. The fighting also has injured close to 390,000 troops, he told Piers Morgan Uncensored on YouTube. On Dec. 8, he said Ukraine had lost some 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield and 370,000 wounded. Russia hasn’t given its number of killed since September 2022, seven months after its all-out invasion. If the U.S. stops sending vital military aid, that could also jeopardize European support, Zelenskyy said in the interview. “Without a doubt, we cannot do without this kind of (Western) support,” he said. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the United States must be part of any Western troop deployment to safeguard a peace deal with Russia and shield against another invasion. Sending only European troops would not be enough, he said. “Because this is not just a matter of numbers, it is about sharing responsibility and ensuring security guarantees. This cannot be done without the United States of America,” he said at a news conference with Lammy. Ukrainian forces are slowly losing ground, especially in eastern areas, where they are being pushed backward by their bigger foe. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Wednesday that Russian troops had captured the villages of Baranivka in the eastern Donetsk region and Novomlynsk in the northeastern Kharkiv region. Baranivka’s capture is part of Russia’s effort to envelop Pokrovsk, a key road and rail hub whose loss would compromise a wider area of defense, while the seizure of Novomlynsk is part of Russia’s onslaught toward Kupiansk, another important train junction. Ukraine keeps hitting the Russian military’s rear areas and supply lines in an effort to disrupt the creeping advance. Ukraine’s Army General staff claimed Wednesday that Ukrainian forces struck an oil refinery in the Krasnodar region of Russia overnight, setting it on fire. According to the General Staff, the oil refinery and petroleum product manufacturing plant supplies gasoline and diesel to the Russian army. The governor of the Krasnodar region, Veniamin Kondratyev, claimed that fragments of a downed Ukrainian drone hit an oil tank at an oil depot in the village of Novominskaya early Wednesday, sparking a fire. The fire was put out shortly after and there were no injuries, emergency officials said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at ",Ukraine wants partner countries to join in postwar development worth billions | AP News,Illia Novikov,AP News,2025-02-05T09:54:30,2025-02-05T20:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-hit-by-suspected-russia-backed-sabotage-campaign/,"German investigators believe that a wave of car vandalism across Germany, initially blamed on radical climate activists, is actually part of a Russian-orchestrated sabotage campaign, according to a Spiegel report published Wednesday. More than 270 vehicles were damaged in Berlin, Brandenburg, Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. Saboteurs sprayed construction foam into car exhaust pipes, rendering vehicles unusable, local police departments told Spiegel. To throw investigators off the scent, the vandals plastered cars with fake eco-stickers featuring Economy Minister Robert Habeck’s face and slogans like “be greener!” According to authorities, their goal was to stoke public outrage against Germany’s Green Party ahead of the national election on Feb. 23. Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Russia has ramped up sabotage operations across Europe, targeting critical infrastructure like undersea cables and even plotting assassinations of defectors and European weapons-makers. Western officials link these acts to Moscow’s hybrid warfare strategy, aiming to destabilize NATO countries, disrupt energy supplies and undermine support for Ukraine. In response, allies have intensified intelligence sharing to counter the growing threat. According to Spiegel, the perpetrators were young men from Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Germany. They weren’t ideological activists but hired hands, recruited at a rate of €100 per vehicle by Russian operatives via messaging apps like Viber. German intelligence officials warn that Russia is increasingly relying on so-called low-level agents for influence operations. These aren’t trained spies but amateurs from petty criminal backgrounds, willing to cause chaos for a quick payout. Investigators searched homes linked to the suspects, seizing mobile phones, laptops and cans of construction foam. While no arrests have been made so far, two suspects have fled the country, according to Spiegel. One of the detained suspects has reportedly confessed, claiming they were promised several thousand euros and assured legal support if caught. The instructions, according to the confession, came directly from a Russian contact.","Russia supported sabotage spree in Germany to roil election campaign, report says",Chris Lunday,POLITICO,2025-02-05T13:21:24,2025-02-05T13:24:05,gemini-2.0-flash

Alphabet has rewritten its guidelines on how it will use AI, dropping a section which previously ruled out applications that were ""likely to cause harm"". Human Rights Watch has criticised the decision, telling the BBC that AI can ""complicate accountability"" for battlefield decisions that ""may have life or death consequences."" In a blog post Google defended the change, arguing that businesses and democratic governments needed to work together on AI that ""supports national security"". Experts say AI could be widely deployed on the battlefield - though there are fears about its use too, particularly with regard to autonomous weapons systems. ""For a global industry leader to abandon red lines it set for itself signals a concerning shift, at a time when we need responsible leadership in AI more than ever,"" said Anna Bacciarelli, senior AI researcher at Human Rights Watch. The ""unilateral"" decision showed also showed ""why voluntary principles are not an adequate substitute for regulation and binding law"" she added. In its blog, Alphabet, said democracies should lead in AI development, guided by what it called ""core values"" like freedom, equality and respect for human rights. ""And we believe that companies, governments and organisations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth and supports national security,"" it added The blog - written by senior vice president James Manyika and Sir Demis Hassabis, who leads the AI lab Google DeepMind - said the company's original AI principles published in 2018 needed to be updated as the technology had evolved. Awareness of the military potential of AI has grown in recent years. In January, MP's argued that the conflict in Ukraine had shown the technology ""offers serious military advantage on the battlefield"" As AI becomes more widespread and sophisticated it would ""change the way defence works, from the back office to the frontline,"" Emma Lewell-Buck MP, who chaired a recent commons report into the UK military's use of AI, wrote. But as well as debate among AI experts and professionals over how the powerful new technology should be governed in broad terms, there is also controversy around the use of AI on the battlefield and in surveillance technologies. Concern is greatest over the potential for AI-powered weapons capable of taking lethal action autonomously, with campaigners arguing controls are urgently needed. The Doomsday Clock - which symbolises how near humanity is to destruction - cited that concernin its latest assessment of the dangers mankind faces. ""Systems that incorporate artificial intelligence in military targeting have been used in Ukraine and the Middle East, and several countries are moving to integrate artificial intelligence into their militaries"", it said. ""Such efforts raise questions about the extent to which machines will be allowed to make military decisionsâ\"""". Originally, long before the current surge of interest in the ethics of AI, Google's founders, Sergei Brin and Larry Page, said their motto for the firm was ""don't be evil"". When the company was restructured under the name Alphabet Inc in 2015 the parent company switched to ""Do the right thing"". Since then Google staff have sometimes pushed back against the approach taken by their executives. In 2018,the firm did not renew a contract for AI work with the US Pentagonfollowing resignations and a petition signed by thousands of employees. They feared ""Project Maven"" was the first step towards using artificial intelligence for lethal purposes. The blog was published just ahead of Alphabet's end of year financial report, showing results that were weaker than market expectations, and knocking back its share price. That was despite a 10% rise in revenue from digital advertising, its biggest earner, boosted by US election spending.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c334l5zn5ero,"The Philippines' parliament has voted to impeach Vice-President Sara Duterte following complaints about alleged corruption. Duterte has been accused of misusing millions of dollars in public funds and threatening to have President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr assassinated. She has denied the charges and alleged she is the victim of a political vendetta. The shock move is widely seen as an escalation of the bitter feud between Duterte and Marcos which has kept the nation on edge for months. Both are scions of Philippine political dynasties: she is the daughter of former president Rodrigo Duterte, while he is the son of the late strongman leader Ferdinand Marcos Sr. A total of 215 out of 306 members of the House of Representatives voted for impeachment, well above the one-third threshold needed for the bill to pass. The bill will now be heard by the 24-member Senate, which will convene as an impeachment court. If found guilty, Duterte faces removal from her post and would be the first vice-president in Philippine history to be impeached. She is expected to stay in office until the Senate delivers its judgement. A trial date has not been set yet. Duterte is widely perceived as a potential successor to Marcos, who is ineligible to run again in 2028 as the constitution limits presidents to a single six-year term. An impeachment would effectively bar her from the presidency, as she would be permanently banned from holding public office. The move comes ahead of the mid-term elections in May, which will be seen as a referendum for Marcos halfway into his term as well a barometer of public support for Duterte. Duterte has not commented on the impeachment vote. But her elder brother who represents their hometown of Davao in parliament, Paolo Duterte, said the administration was ""treading on dangerous ground"" with what he described as a ""clear act of political persecution"". Marcos has also not commented on Duterte's impeachment. In November, he had said it would be a ""waste of time"" for lawmakers to impeach her when it has more important work to do. Since the end of Ferdinand Marcos Sr's dictatorship and the restoration of democracy in 1986, only one sitting president has been impeached - Joseph Estrada in 2000, for alleged corruption. But his trial ended without a judgement after a popular revolt forced him from power in January 2001. Only one impeachment trial made it to a verdict, that of former Supreme Court chief justice Renato Corona, who was convicted of corruption in 2012. Both the Estrada and Corona impeachment trials were highly politicised and divisive affairs and dragged on for months. Duterte and Marcos had presented a picture of unity when they ran for the 2022 elections, calling themselves the ""UniTeam"". But cracks began to appear even before they assumed office, when Duterte asked to handle the defence portfolio in Marcos' cabinet but instead was made education minister. Their alliance unravelled further soon after they took power, as they pursued their separate political agendas while differing on crucial fronts such as diplomacy. Their differences on the Philippines' relationship to the US and China became more pronounced, as encounters between Philippine and Chinese ships in disputed waters became more frequent. Marcos has pivoted the Philippines back to the US, reversing the pro-China stance of Duterte's father. He has also promised a less violent approach against illegal drug rings, dialling back the elder Duterte's ""war on drugs"" that left over 6,000 suspects killed, according to a government count. The lower house of parliament, where Marcos's allies hold power, then started scrutinising Duterte's budget requests, particularly her confidential funds which are not covered by state audits. In July last year, she resigned from the cabinet. The feud took a dramatic turn a few months later when, in a late-night livestreamed press conference, Duterte said she ""talked to a person"" to ""go kill"" Marcos if she were assassinated. She later said that she was not plotting to assassinate the President and Marcos had dismissed the threat as a ""storm in a teacup"".",Sara Duterte: Philippines feud escalates as lawmakers vote to impeach vice-president,Virma Simonette & Joel Guinto,BBC News,2025-02-05T07:58:17,2025-02-05T07:58:17,gemini-2.0-flash
https://buenosairesherald.com/world/international-relations/argentina-to-withdraw-from-world-health-organization,"Argentina is pulling out of the World Health Organization (WHO). President Javier Milei has ordered Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein to withdraw the country from the organization, due to “deep differences” over how the WHO managed the COVID-19 pandemic, Presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni announced in a press conference on Wednesday morning. The Milei administration’s announcement was made in lockstep with the United States’ withdrawal from the global public health agency, underscoring Argentina’s alignment with President Donald Trump. Adorni said that the WHO’s pandemic management, along with decisions made by former President Alberto Fernández, “led [Argentina] to the longest lockdown in human history” and for the country to be subject to “certain countries’ political influence.” “Argentines won’t allow for an international organization to intervene in our sovereignty, much less in our health,” Adorni said. The government has claimed that exiting the WHO will not affect healthcare in Argentina. However, critics were quick to argue that it would affect important components of the country’s public health system, including vaccine purchases and outbreak monitoring. The World Health Organization is a United Nations agency that coordinates global public health. Founded in 1948, its work includes directing health emergency responses and promoting universal access to healthcare. It has 194 member countries. Adorni said that Argentina does not receive funding from the WHO for healthcare management, and that the move would therefore not imply cuts. “It will not affect the quality of healthcare services,” he said. “On the contrary, it provides the country with more flexibility to implement policies that are adapted to the context of interests that Argentina requires, and more availability of resources,” Adorni continued. “It reinforces our path as a country with healthcare sovereignty.” Argentine Health Minister Mario Lugones said: “Argentina does not receive financing from the WHO, and while some technical cooperation projects may receive financing, this is realized through the PAHO [Pan-American Health Organization]. It is important to emphasize that leaving the WHO does not mean leaving the PAHO, which predates it and depends on the Organization of American States.” The PAHO is the Organization of American States’ health arm, but also the WHO’s regional office for the Americas. The implications and feasibility of Argentina leaving one, but not the other, are not immediately clear. In addition to the WHO withdrawal, Argentina is also “analyzing leaving the Paris Agreement” on climate change, Adorni added. After the announcement, Milei described the WHO’s COVID-19 responses as “the largest social control experiment in history.” The lockdowns, he wrote on X, meant “committing, in complicity with all the countries that followed their directives, one of the most bizarre crimes against humanity in history.” You may also be interested in: Argentina to exit international institutions in line with Trump’s lead Leandro Cahn, director of the HIV prevention nonprofit Fundación Huésped, posted on X that leaving the WHO would affect Argentina’s capacity to monitor outbreaks and participate in technology transfer. “We would not be able to buy vaccines and HIV treatments through their rotating fund, which makes costs significantly cheaper,” he wrote. A statement by the presidential communications team published on X minutes after Adorni’s press conference said that the WHO promoted “never-ending lockdowns” during the COVID-19 pandemic “without any scientific evidence.” “Today, scientific evidence indicates that the WHO’s rulebook does not work because it’s the result of political influence,” the statement said, adding that the organization “limits countries’ sovereignty.” Buenos Aires Province Health Minister Nicolás Kreplak, of the Peronist opposition, said the decision would leave Argentina to face health challenges on its own. He wrote on X that it means Argentina will no longer have “international collaboration for training, information, scientific studies and epidemiological impact analysis for future epidemics and pandemics.” Kreplak added that the country would lose financial support for prevention and immunization campaigns for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV and dengue, affecting its response capacity. Like Cahn, he expressed concern that the potential loss of funding from the WHO, through its Americas arm, the Pan American Health Organization, would affect Argentina. This is used for purchasing medicine, vaccines, resources and devices. “the question remains about whether this will be affected, losing all possibility to make this purchases at a cheaper cost.” This decision comes a fortnight after Trump announced the United States’ withdrawal from the agency, as well as the Paris Agreement, on his first day in office. Trump first attempted to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO in 2020, likewise blaming the organization’s pandemic management, but ex-President Joe Biden revoked the decision when his term began, before it took effect. “The WHO continues to demand unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries’ assessed payments,” said a White House statement released January 20. On Tuesday, Trump also ordered the withdrawal of the U.S. from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and prohibited any future funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), saying these are “anti-American organizations.” All Right Reserved.Buenos Aires Herald",Argentina to withdraw from World Health Organization,Buenos Aires Herald,Buenos Aires Herald,2025-02-05T14:40:05,2025-02-05T18:48:05,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.wired.com/story/2024-ransomware-payments-fall-chainalysis/,"For much of the past year, the trail of destruction and mayhem left behind by ransomware hackers was on full display. Digital extortion gangs paralyzed hundreds of US pharmacies and clinics through their attack on Change Healthcare, exploited security vulnerabilities in the customer accounts of cloud provider Snowflake to breach a string of high-profile targets, and extracted a record $75 million from a single victim. Yet beneath those headlines, the numbers tell a surprising story: Ransomware payments actually fell overall in 2024—and in the second half of the year dropped more precipitously than in any six-month period on record. Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis today released a portion of its annual crime report focused on tracking the ransomware industry, which found that ransomware victims’ extortion payments totaled $814 million in 2024, a drop of 35 percent compared to the record $1.25 billion that hackers extracted from ransomware victims the previous year. Breaking down the payments over the course of 2024 shows an even more positive trend: Hackers collected just $321 million from July through December compared to $492 million the previous half year, the biggest falloff in payments between two six-month periods that Chainalysis has ever seen. “The drastic reversal of the trends we were seeing in the first half of the year to the second was quite surprising,” says Jackie Burns Koven, who leads cyber threat intelligence at Chainalysis. She suggests that dropoff is likely due to law enforcement takedowns and disruptions, some of which had delayed effects that weren't immediately apparent in the first half of the year as ransomware victims and the cybersecurity industry grappled with catastrophic attacks. “Don't get me wrong: For everyone who's a defender or an incident responder, it's been a year,"" Burns Koven says. “But it is noteworthy that for the major attacks that occurred last year, those groups don't exist anymore or have been laying low. There's been a strong signal from law enforcement that if you cross the line, there's going to be consequences.” US and UK law enforcement scored two significant disruptions of major ransomware groups around the beginning of 2024: Six days before Christmas of 2023, the FBI announced that it had found vulnerabilities in the encryption software used by the group known as BlackCat or AlphV, distributed decryption keys to victims to foil the group’s extortion tactics, and taken down the dark-web sites the group had used to issue its threats. Two months later, in February of 2024, the UK’s National Crime Agency carried out an operation against the notorious ransomware group Lockbit, hijacking its infrastructure, seizing its cryptocurrency wallets, taking down its dark-web sites, and even obtaining information about its members and cybercriminal partners. Initially, however, both groups seemed to bounce back from those busts. AlphV in February announced that it had hacked Change Healthcare, disabling payments at hundreds of US clinics and pharmacies and extracting $22 million from the United Healthcare–owned company in one of the worst health-care-related ransomware incidents in history. Lockbit, too, seemed to shake off the NCA’s blows, immediately launching a new dark-web site where it continued to extort victims old and new. But in fact, both law enforcement operations may have been more successful than they appeared. AlphV, after receiving its $22 million ransom from Change Healthcare, pulled a so-called “exit scam,” taking the money and disappearing rather than sharing it with the hacker partners who had carried out the Change breach. Lockbit, too, largely fell off the map in the months that followed the NCA’s takedown, due perhaps to the cybercriminal underground’s distrust of the group and its alleged leader, Dmitry Khoroshev, when it became clear the NCA had identified him. In May of 2024, Khoroshev was also sanctioned by the US Treasury, making it far more legally complicated for Lockbit victims to pay a ransom to the group. While the vacuum left behind by those major players in the ransomware ecosystem was filled by newer groups during the second half of 2024, many of them didn’t have the skills or experience to go after targets as big and as well defended as Lockbit and AlphV had, says Burns Koven. The result, she says, was far smaller ransom payments, often in the tens of thousands of dollars rather than the millions or tens of millions. “Their talent is not quite as robust as their predecessors,“ Burns Koven says of the newer generation of ransomware gangs. “We're seeing the hangover of these law enforcement takedowns, not just directly targeting individuals and strains of malware but also the infrastructure and tools and services that had been used to help perpetuate these attacks.” Last year actually saw more ransomware incidents than the previous year, says Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst focused on ransomware at the security firm Recorded Future. The firm counted 4,634 attacks in 2024 versus 4,400 in 2023. But the lower ransom amounts received by those newer ransomware groups suggests they may have been favoring quantity over quality, he says. “What we're seeing in terms of payments is a reflection of newer threat actors being attracted by the amount of money that they see you can make in ransomware, trying to get into the game and not being very good at it,” Liska says. In addition to major law enforcement actions at the beginning of 2024, Chainalysis attributes the decline in payments during the second half of the year to heightened global awareness about the threat of ransomware, leading to more mature defenses and response plans within governments and other institutions. And Burns Koven adds that cryptocurrency regulation and law enforcement crackdowns on money laundering infrastructure, including mixers that help criminals anonymize and obfuscate the source of their ill-gotten cryptocurrencies, have also eroded ransomware actors’ abilities to handle payments without specialized knowledge. While the decline in payments during the second half of 2024 is significant for being the largest ever in Chainalysis’s data, the number of ransomware attacks and volume of payments has fluctuated and declined before. Notably, researchers saw a marked decrease in activity in 2022, a year in which Chainalysis placed total ransomware payments at $655 million compared to $1.07 billion in 2021 and nearly $1 billion in 2020. But while governments and defenders were initially heartened that their deterrence efforts were working, ransomware surged back as an even more dire threat in 2023, totaling, by Chainalysis’s count, $1.25 billion in payments that year. ""I think ebbs and flows are inevitable,"" says Brett Callow, a managing director at FTI Consulting and longtime ransomware researcher. ""If the baddies had a couple of brilliant quarters, a dip will follow, same as if the goodies had some good quarters. That's why we really need to analyze trends over a longer period, because increases and decreases over shorter periods don't really tell us much.” Additionally, researchers have long warned that it is difficult to get truly reliable numbers about the volume of ransomware attacks and an accurate total of payments each year. This is partly the result of attackers attempting to inflate their records and make themselves seem more effective and menacing by claiming old data breaches as new attacks or simply making up attacks that they haven’t actually carried out. And it is always difficult to get accurate numbers about ransomware (not to mention digital scams more broadly), because stigma and regulatory requirements often keep victims from coming forward. This makes ransomware forecasting more of an art than a science.

https://balkaninsight.com/2025/02/05/rights-groups-protest-as-press-freedom-violations-surge-in-turkey/,"Forty Turkish and international press freedom, human rights and journalists’ organisations and media outlets have issued a joint letter protesting over the escalation in press freedom violations in Turkey. “The frequent use of arbitrary arrests, detentions, judicial control measures and convictions poses an existential threat to independent media, democratic discourse and fundamental human rights in the country,” the joint letter signed by organisations led by the International Press Institute, IPI, wrote. The joint letter underlined that in January alone at least nine journalists were arrested, six were sentenced to prison, five were detained, 23 faced investigations and one encountered police obstruction. Organisations including the European Federation of Journalists, EFJ, Freedom House and Turkey’s Media and Law Studies Association, MLSA, urged Turkey’s government to reverse these decisions. “We urge the Turkish authorities to uphold the principles of justice, release the journalists subjected to arbitrary arrests and detentions, and safeguard the vital role of journalism in fostering debate on matters of public interest and democracy,” the letter wrote. A timeline of events was shared by the joint letter, including the launch of an investigation into T24 columnist Sirin Payzin for alleged “terrorist propaganda” over social media posts. Halk TV editor-in-chief Suat Toktas, program coordinator Kursad Oguz and journalist BarÄ±s Pehlivan were detained for broadcasting a recorded phone conversation with an expert witness. Pehlivan and Oguz were released under judicial control measures. Toktas was arrested on January 29 citing flight risk and potential evidence tampering, demonstrating a concerning use of arbitrary detention criteria. On January 28, journalist Safiye Alagas, a former news editor for the pro-Kurdish JINNEWS outlet, was handed a six-year-and-three-month prison sentence, the letter recalled. Right organisations said the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan uses judicial control measures as a new tool for censoring the media. “While there appears to be a decrease in the number of journalists in prison, this masks a troubling shift toward using judicial control measures – such as travel bans, regular check-ins at police stations and house arrest – as alternative means of restricting press freedom,” the letter wrote. The letter highlighted that this trend represents “an equally antidemocratic practice aimed at controlling journalists’ freedom of movement and expression”. “The systematic implementation of these measures, combined with increasing online censorship, appears to be replacing traditional detention as a method of silencing independent journalism,” it said. Turkey ranked in 158th place out of 180 countries in 2024 in the latest press freedom index issued by the watchdog organisation Reporters Without Borders, RSF. “With authoritarianism gaining ground in Turkey, media pluralism is being called into question. All possible means are used to undermine critics,” RSF wrote.",Rights Groups Protest as Press Freedom Violations Surge in Turkey,Hamdi Firat Buyuk,Balkan Insight,2025-02-05T11:11:47,2025-02-05T11:11:47,gemini-2.0-flash

Human Rights Council's (UNHRC) efforts to promote human rights, the foreign ministry said Wednesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump said his country will quit the international body.

https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ursula-von-der-leyen-measures-boost-eu-defense-spending-commission/,"BRUSSELS — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen privately suggested triggering an emergency clause to allow countries to increase defense spending, four European Union officials told POLITICO. The idea, made during a closed-door meeting with national leaders on Monday, would allow governments to increase their defense spending substantially without violating the EU’s budget rules. Those rules allow countries to deviate from their spending plans “in the event of a severe economic downturn” or in “exceptional circumstances outside the control of government.” Von der Leyen told reporters she would ""use the full range that we have of flexibilities in the Stability and Growth Pact to allow for a significant increase in defense spending.” She added: “For extraordinary times, it is possible to have extraordinary measures also in the Stability and Growth Pact. And I think we live in extraordinary times."" During the earlier meeting, she had also floated specifically exempting defense spending from national budget deficits but did not go into further detail, one of the four officials said. Von der Leyen is under pressure from highly indebted southern European countries,			 such as Italy and Greece, to treat defense spending differently. Officials said triggering the emergency clause would allow countries to spend more on defense without reopening a deal on national spending that came into force last year after long and arduous haggling. “If a faster increase [in spending] is due to defense, they might say these are exceptional times,” said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. “So I mean, now we have a threat from Russia” and the United States security guarantee for Europe appears to have weakened, he added. The revived spending rules were criticized in many ways, not least for straightjacketing countries in the case of unexpected events such as war, which require immediate fiscal responses. The invasion of Ukraine had not only triggered an abrupt reassessment of EU member countries’ defense preparedness, but had also required heavy government subsidies to keep a lid on energy prices. Defense of the realms Under the rules, which are an attempt to enforce collective fiscal discipline, each country is required to precommit to four- or seven-year plans to get their deficits and debt levels within agreed limits. The pandemic and the Ukraine war left many EU countries with excessive budget deficits, and the need for such adjustment plans. But those plans are now under fresh pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump’s demand for a sharp and immediate rise in defense spending above and beyond the reference level for NATO members, which is 2 percent of gross domestic product. The current rules offer a number of small concessions for countries that want to scale up their military budgets. Countries that commit to stronger defense capabilities are allowed “a more gradual fiscal adjustment,” according to a Commission spokesperson. Moreover, increases in defense spending can be considered a mitigating factor for countries whose expenditure levels would normally trigger the Commission’s sanctions procedure. In a further concession, national capitals are discussing broadening the definition of what constitutes defense spending, as critics such as Poland argue that the current framework is too conservative.",Von der Leyen signals ‘extraordinary’ measure to boost EU defense spending,"Gregorio Sorgi, Jacopo Barigazzi, Giovanna Faggionato",POLITICO,2025-02-04T16:05:45,2025-02-04T16:05:45,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/congo-rebels-goma-m23-rwanda-ceasefire-24470048e1382a787131ce81d1ee7c5a,"GOMA, Congo (AP) — Congo’s government on Tuesday described the unilateral ceasefire declared by Rwanda-backed rebels in eastern Congo as “false communication,” while the United Nations noted reports of heavy fighting with Congolese forces in the region. The M23 rebels on Monday announced the ceasefire on humanitarian grounds after pleas for the safe passage of aid and hundreds of thousands of displaced people. But “all we are waiting for is the withdrawal of the M23,” Congo’s government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya told journalists. The M23 last week seized control of Goma, a city of 2 million people at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth. It remains under rebel control. The M23 had been reported to be gaining ground in other areas of eastern Congo and advancing on another provincial capital, Bukavu, in South Kivu. On Tuesday, U.N, spokesman Stephane Dujarric told journalists they had reports of heavy fighting in South Kivu, though “we don’t have any reports of the M23 moving closer to Bukavu.” The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts. That’s far more than in 2012, when they briefly captured Goma then withdrew after international pressure. The M23 are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups active in Congo’s east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world’s technology. Congo’s government has said it is open to talks to resolve the conflict, but that dialogue must occur within the context of previous peace agreements. Rwanda and the rebels have accused Congo of defaulting on previous agreements. Regional leaders are meeting Friday and Saturday in Tanzania to discuss the conflict. Also Tuesday, Congo’s interior minister, Jacquemain Shabani, said the death toll in last week’s fighting had reached 2,000, asserting that bodies had been put into one or more mass graves. Shabani called them “victims of massacres perpetrated by the Rwandan occupation army.” There was no immediate Rwanda comment. On Monday, the U.N. health agency said at least 900 people had been killed in the fighting in Goma between the rebels and Congolese forces. Residents continued to bury bodies. “I just saw the conditions in which our Congolese brothers were buried, our children who were shot during the events in Goma,” Elisha Dunia, the father of one victim, told The Associated Press at a cemetery in the city. “We are heartbroken, and we ask for peace to return to our country.” Debors Zuzu, also at the cemetery, said he lost three family members, two in a bomb explosion while another was shot. He said he was devastated. “Our biggest plea is for the leaders to ensure that the war ends because war has no value. We want peace in Goma,” Zuzu said. “If everyone dies, I don’t know who the leaders will govern.” The U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Congo, Bruno Lemarquis, called for the urgent reopening of the airport in Goma, calling it “a lifeline” for the evacuation of wounded people and the delivery of aid. ___ Kamale reported from Kinshasa, Congo.

https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-zelenskyy-puts-ukrainian-war-dead-at-over-45000/a-71507510,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said
c
b
on Tuesday that 45,100 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed defending the country against the Russian invasion since February 2022.
Another 390,000 troops have been injured, he said.
What else did Zelenskyy say?
With the situation on the frontlines largely at a stalemate
as the third anniversary of the start of the full-scale war approaches, Zelenskyy has said he would be willing to hold direct talks with Russian President Russian Vladimir Putin to end the conflict.
""If that is the only set-up in which we can bring peace to the citizens of Ukraine and not lose people, definitely we will go for this set-up,"" he told British media personality Piers Morgan in an interview broadcast on YouTube on Tuesday.
He added that such talks would have to involve ""four participants.""
""If people believe we must move to the diplomatic track, and I believe we are ready to move to the diplomatic track, there must be the United States, Europe, Ukraine and Russia,"" he said.
Europeans uncertain about Trump role on Ukraine
While Zelenskyy stressed that Kyiv would not recognize Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territory, he acknowledged that Western support had been ""regrettably … insufficient to push Putin fully out of our territories.""
Asked how he would feel if he sat opposite Putin at a negotiating table, the Ukrainian leader said: ""I would not be kind to him, I consider him an enemy. To be honest, I think he considers me an enemy, too."" Putin has ruled out speaking to Zelenskyy directly.
Zelenskyy estimated Russian casualties at over 350,000 dead and up to 700,000 injured or missing since 2022.
The figures could not be independently verified.
What role does US President Donald Trump play?
Tentative talk of negotiations is not only a result of casualties and war fatigue; it coincides with the return of US President Donald Trump to the White House having promised to end the war in Ukraine as soon as possible.
How exactly he intends to do that remains unclear, with his pronouncements thus far ranging from threats to pull US military support for Ukraine to threats of further economic sanctions on Russia.
In the Tuesday interview, Zelenskyy stressed he did not
c
b
want to see Russian sanctions lifted, saying he believed this would only ""increase the risk of a second invasion"" in future.
Earlier on Tuesday, Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv that his team was already in contact with Washington's top Ukraine official Keith Kellogg and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and that there were ""working dates"" for an American delegation to visit.
""Now the dates and members of the delegation are being agreed upon, and we are waiting for the team,"" he said. ""We will work together.""
Could Ukraine give US access to 'rare earths'?
On Monday, Trump demanded access to key strategic minerals in Ukraine in return for continued US military security for Kyiv. The idea had first been floated by Zelenskyy last year, who said it would only be ""fair"" to offer US companies access to rare metals which are essential for various technologies.
Despite almost 20% of Ukrainian territory currently being under Russian occupation, Zelenskyy said Kyiv still had access to ""sufficient"" amounts of rare resources.
""I would like US business ... to develop this field here,"" he said, according to comments published by his office.
""We are open to the fact that all this can be developed with our partners, who are both helping us to protect our land and pushing the enemy back with their weapons and sanctions packages. This is absolutely fair.""
A large portion of Ukraine's mineral resources is found in the eastern Donbas region, much of which is controlled by Russian forces and where Moscow has made incremental gains over the past year.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-will-germany-india-multi-billion-dollar-submarine-deal-impact-russia/a-71454656,"Germany's Thyssenkrupp will build six submarines for the Indian Navy along with its Indian partner. However, the deal is not necessarily a sign that New Delhi will end its defense sector dependence on Russia. The German engineering and steel production conglomerate	Thyssenkrupp	 is set to build six submarines for the Indian navy in a multi-billion-dollar deal after a bid with its Indian partner was approved. The conglomerate's shipbuilding division, known as Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), teamed up with India's state-owned Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders (MDS) for the contract. Both companies recently confirmed	that India's Ministry of Defense had opened the bid for ""further processing."" The bid was the only one to clear the navy's field trials, beating off competition from Spanish company Navantia, which had partnered with India's Larsen & Toubro. An exchange filing by MDS said the Indian Ministry of Defense had invited the company for commercial negotiations. Media reports quoting people close to the discussions put the value of the project at around $5.2 billion (€5 billion), but the final figure could be higher. In a statement provided to DW by Thyssenkrupp, Oliver Burkhard, CEO of TKMS, said,	""By acting in partnership, and with the support of the German and Indian governments MDL and Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems will be setting standards for a sustainable and safe maritime future."" The deal is not necessarily a sign that India's dependence on Russian military imports will be reduced anytime soon. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Russia accounted for 36% of India's defense imports from 2019-2023, the most of any single country. ""India's reliance on the Russian military platforms continues unabated, and it has shown little desire to substantially reduce that dependence on Moscow,"" Sushant Singh, lecturer in South Asian studies at Yale University, told DW. However, SL	Narasimhan, a retired member of the Indian defense forces and an expert in Indian security issues, expects more collaboration between India and Europe on defense ""when the requirement, price expectations and availability match."" Speaking with DW, he	pointed	to a recent agreement between France and India to build Scorpene class submarines in India as another example of collaboration.	 Germany has also been exporting arms in large volumes to India. In the first six months of 2024, India was the third-largest recipient of German arms, valued at around 	€153.75 million ($160 million). The deal with Thyssenkrupp is for six diesel submarines, known as advanced conventional submarines. Among the technical requirements is that the submarines have air-independent propulsion (AIP) technology, allowing them to stay underwater	longer to increase stealth capacity. It's part of an Indian Navy strategy to boost its capability in the face of the Chinese navy's growing presence in the Indian Ocean and across South Asia. ""India is now becoming a major maritime power of the world,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said earlier this month at the launch of two Indian-made warships and a submarine. TKMS has said it will help with	engineering and designing the new submarines, with MDS building	them in India. Thyssenkrupp has a substantial history with the Indian Navy. Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, a former shipbuilder now owned by TKMS, built four submarines for India in the 1980s, with two built in the German city of Kiel and two in Mumbai. Sushant Singh says	there was ""nothing new"" about this latest deal. ""It is an old project which has moved forward after major delays when the fleet of submarines in the Indian navy has reached a critical stage."" Modi has prioritized domestic defense manufacturing	and	Indian defense spending overall has increased substantially in absolute terms during his decade as prime minister. However, defense spending	as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen in each of the past four years. ""The defense forces are crying for modernization but are getting no funds to buy modern weapons and platforms,"" said	Singh. ""More than half of India's defense spending goes towards personnel costs, and with high inflation and falling foreign exchange rates, the funds for buying defense equipment are coming down drastically in real terms."" The deal with Thyssenkrupp aligns with Modi's domestic manufacturing push since the submarines will be built in India. However, according to the most recent data from SIPRI, India remains the world's largest arms importer,	accounting	for almost 10% of global arms imports between 2019 and 2023. Central to that story has been Russia, still the key partner for Modi's government when it comes to arms imports, but there are signs that dependence is gradually falling. While 36% of Indian arms exports came from Russia from 2019-2023, the figure was 46% for 2017-2021 and 69% for 2012-2016. Singh is doubtful, however, saying the deal with Thyssenkrupp is not typical of a trend. ""These kinds of limited collaborations, with a past record and for some specific equipment, can happen."" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video During a meeting between Modi and	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz	 last October, the two leaders agreed to support ""enhanced industry-level cooperation in the defense sector,"" singling out a specific focus on ""technology collaboration, manufacturing and co-development of defense platforms and equipment."" When approached by DW for comment about possible future Indian-German defense sector collaboration, the German Ministry for Defence referred to a statement made by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius on a visit to India in 2023. ""We need reliable cooperation in the field of armaments and military cooperation with strategically reliable partners. And that includes India,"" he said at the time. Nonetheless, Singh expects high volumes of Russian imports to continue to India due to several factors. ""This is because of the low price of Russian platforms, Moscow's willingness to transfer high technology, and the Russian control of spares and ammunition for equipment already in Indian military service.""

https://www.dw.com/en/thailand-pms-china-visit-aims-to-allay-safety-concerns/a-71502860,"In talks with China's leadership this week, including President Xi Jinping, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra is expected to emphasize that Thailand is on board with increasing security and doing more to make Chinese tourists feel safe. China is Thailand's top trading partner, and its biggest inbound tourism market. But a recent high-profile abduction of a Chinese actor from Thailand has spooked many Chinese tourists. In January, actor Wang Xing flew to Bangkok for what he thought was a casting call. Instead, he was picked up at the airport and driven across the border to Myawaddy, Myanmar and forced to work in a cyber-scam center. Wang was rescued by Thai authorities four days after he disappeared in January, but the case has since caused a huge stir in China and worldwide, prompting both Thai and Chinese officials to promise further action. Most of these telecom and internet scam centers are operated by Chinese criminal syndicates in Southeast Asia and are particularly rife in Myanmar and Cambodia. Many of the victims are Chinese, and are trafficked via Thailand. ""The scammers are a big deal for Thailand because scam centers are threatening Thailand's tourism and hospitality industries. Scam centers are bad news, and Chinese tourists are a big intake,"" Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, told DW. Chinese tourism is vital for Thailand's economy, with over 6 million arrivals in 2024. But the impact of Wang's trafficking saw Chinese visitors cancel their trips to Thailand for Lunar New Year. This was despite Thailand's tourism bureau taking steps to publish a press release in Mandarin in January, reassuring Chinese nationals that ""Thailand attaches great importance to the safety of tourists.""  Thailand still predicts there will be 9 million Chinese arrivals this year, which will be nearly a quarter of total international arrivals forecasted for 2025.  Pravit Rojanaphruk, a Thai journalist and political observer, says Thailand will focus on reassuring China this week that its citizens are safe in the country.  ""Thailand is very sensitive to any negative perception about its country, particularly from the Chinese point of view, as they constitute the largest group of foreign tourists to Thailand. The Thai prime ministerÂ
hopes that President Xi would be able to help restore confidence among some Chinese,"" he told DW. There is already cooperation on combating crime, with Bangkok and Beijing planning to set up anti-scam centers. It is reported Chinese authorities will operate one such center in the Thai-Myanmar border city, Mae Sot.  Thailand has also helped transfer about 900 Chinese nationals who had been trapped in scam operations in Myanmar last year, but the number of Chinese nationals still missing is thought to be much higher. Nikorndej Balankura, a Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson, said in January that combating cross-border crimes is a ""national priority.""  Myanmar is also entering its fifth year of civil war, which has created a security vacuum.Â China is heavily invested in Myanmar and has tried to intervene and mediate ceasefires, as well as backing both the junta and the resistance, without success. ""For China it is about ensuring that Thailand is still part of the geo-strategic chessboard, the Belt and Road Initiative. I think China has a big headache with Myanmar, so it is much more important now to get Thailand to stay on board,"" he told DW.

Mark S. Cogan, associate professor of peace and
c onflict studies at Kansai Gaidai University in Osaka, Japan, told DW that Paetongtarn will try and avoid the thorny topic of Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. In January, officials in Thailand and Malaysia indicated they would prevent Chinese businesses trying to circumvent US tariffs by shipping goods through their countries, theSouth China Morning Postreported. ""The economy is an important issue for both as I expect both to soon feel the economic headwindsfrom Trump's transactional approach to trade,"" Cogan said. ""Trade between China and Thailand has never been greater and in the absence of alternatives, the news that bothThailandand Malaysia plan to back Trump's trade war withChinais contentious at best.

https://apnews.com/article/washington-plane-crash-helicopter-recovery-7f492db9e867af2e184d621f56cbc4f6,"ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) — The remains of all 67 victims of last week’s midair collision of an American Airlines flight and an Army helicopter near the nation’s capital have been recovered, authorities said Tuesday. All but one has been identified. Meanwhile the NTSB said it was examining new data that could put the helicopter above its 200-foot (61-meter) flight ceiling. The airport’s air traffic control screen — relying on radar sensors and other data — had it at 300 feet (91 meters), the agency said. However that figure would have been rounded to the nearest 100 feet, according to authorities. Investigators said they need to get more information from the still-submerged Black Hawk to verify the data. The jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325 feet (99 meters), plus or minus 25 feet (7.6 meters). Earlier in the day, crews working in choppy conditions raised a number of large pieces of the jetliner from the Potomac River, including the right wing, the center fuselage and parts of the forward cabin, cockpit, tail cone and rudder. “Our hearts are with the victims’ families as they navigate this tragic loss,” officials said in a joint statement from the city and federal agencies involved in the search and recovery, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Navy dive teams and Washington police and fire crews. The chief medical examiner will be working to positively identify the final set of remains, officials said. The collision occurred last Wednesday night as the plane was about to land at nearby Ronald Reagan National Airport, killing everyone on board both aircraft. Authorities said early on that they expected to recover the remains of everyone who died, and they are now focusing on retrieving the jet and hope to recover the helicopter later this week. On Monday salvage crews were able to pull one of the two jet engines from the river, along with large pieces of the plane’s exterior, Col. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers said. Sixty passengers and four crew were on the American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, including figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships there. The Black Hawk was on a training mission. Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were aboard. Federal investigators are trying to piece together the events that led to the collision. Full investigations typically take a year or more, but they hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground. ___ Dale reported from Philadelphia.", Authorities recover remains of all 67 victims from DC plane crash,"Serkan Gurbuz, Maryclaire Dale",AP News,2025-02-04T15:28:03,2025-02-04T19:29:05,gemini-2.0-flash

https://apnews.com/article/eu-moldova-energy-russia-cuts-gazprom-3657d8204486044384a4b1a3b8105446,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union and Moldova on Tuesday agreed on an energy security plan aimed at weaning the country off its dependence on Russian supplies and integrating it into the 27-nation bloc’s network. The EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, said that Moldova would receive 250 million euros ($258 million) this year — 40% of it by mid-April — after Russia’s state-owned energy giant Gazprom cut supplies on Jan. 1. Daily electrical outages were imposed after hundreds of thousands of people in Moldova’s separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region were left without heating and hot water last month over an alleged $709 million bill for past supplies to Moldova. The decision by Gazprom, which came into effect a day after a gas transit agreement between Russia and Ukraine expired, halted gas supplies to Transnistria’s gas-operated Kuciurgan power plant, the country’s largest, which provided a significant portion of Moldova’s electricity. The commission said that its financial package will provide support to consumers in Moldova – a candidate country for EU membership – to help pay their rising electricity bills. Some 60 million euros ($62 million) is earmarked for 350,000 people left in the cold in Transnistria. Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.5 million people, was left entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, but it has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources. The war also forced the EU to end its dependence on Russian energy imports. It has faced pressure from Moscow to give up its westward shift of recent years. Transnistria broke away from Moldova after a short war in 1992 but is not widely recognized.",EU and Moldova agree on an energy security plan to wean the country off Russian supplies,,AP News,2025-02-04T10:09:46,2025-02-04T06:09:46,gemini-2.0-flash

Analysts said the exercise underscored Manila’s efforts to assert its maritime claims while testing Washington’s commitment to regional security under the renewed US-Philippines alliance. During a media briefing on the same day, Armed Forces of the Philippines public affairs chief Colonel Xerxes Trinidad said it was “the first exercise under the [Trump] administration”. When asked about the implications for US-Philippines relations, Trinidad said bilateral ties had “been established over a long period of time” and remained strong at both the military and people-to-people levels. “We expect them to remain that way,” he added. Scarborough Shoal has been a key flashpoint in the South China Sea, where Beijing asserts sweeping claims under its “nine-dash line”, a stance rejected by an international tribunal in 2016. The ruling also recognised the atoll, which lies within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ), as a traditional fishing ground for Southeast Asian nations. However, China continues to restrict access to the maritime feature. Tensions over the area were exacerbated last December when China submitted to the United Nations nautical charts and geographic coordinates officially claiming the shoal, which it called Huangyan Island, as part of its maritime territory.","South China Sea: Philippine, US planes fly near contested shoal in ‘message’ to Beijing",Raissa Robles,South China Morning Post,2025-02-04T11:00:26,2025-02-04T11:10:04,gemini-2.0-flash

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250204001054315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, Feb. 4 (Yonhap) -- President Yoon Suk Yeol said Tuesday he ordered sending troops to offices of the National Election Commission (NEC) during his martial law declaration as he has suspected election fraud allegations. Yoon made the admission while attending the fifth formal hearing of his impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court in Seoul, where he again denied allegations that he ordered military commanders to drag lawmakers out of parliament in an attempt to prevent them from blocking the martial law imposition. ""I ordered then Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun to dispatch troops to NEC offices,"" Yoon said. ""It was not meant to conduct any criminal investigations, but to check systems and how they are operated."" Yoon added that he issued the order to Kim days before declaring martial law while discussing the matter with him. ""When I dealt with electoral fraud cases as a prosecutor, I saw many incomprehensible, fake ballots. And I've long thought of election fraud problems,"" Yoon said. Hundreds of troops were sent to election offices in Seoul, Gwacheon and Suwon in Gyeonggi Province, during the Dec. 3 martial law decree. Yoon has raised questions over the NEC's credibility following alleged cyberattacks by North Korean hackers, though the NEC has dismissed such allegations as groundless. The National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon over his shocking, albeit short-lived, imposition of martial law. Yoon was indicted over charges of leading an insurrection and has been under arrest. Yoon is also alleged to have sent military troops to the National Assembly to keep lawmakers from voting down the martial law declaration and to have planned to arrest key political figures. ""Nothing actually happened (during martial law decree) ... I feel like we are chasing the moon's shadow on a lake,"" Yoon said. ""You would know the true nature of this case if you saw it based on common sense."" Yoon claimed that dragging lawmakers from parliament could not have been possible as there are thousands of civilians in the National Assembly compound and troops were withdrawn after martial law was lifted. During Tuesday's session, Lee Jin-woo, former head of the Capital Defense Command, said he had not received orders from Yoon or Kim to prevent lawmakers from voting to lift martial law. Lee reportedly told prosecutors earlier that Yoon ordered him to instruct troops to carry out lawmakers from inside, ""firing guns and breaking down doors"" if necessary. Lee, who was accused of involvement in the martial law imposition and is currently under arrest, was called as a witness by the National Assembly's legal team. The parliamentary team has been acting as the prosecutor in the trial on whether to uphold or reject the Assembly's impeachment of Yoon. Asked if he believes that Kim's troop dispatch order was legal, Lee said he still sees it as legitimate in accordance with the Martial Law Act. Lee, however, refused to testify further. ""I myself am involved in a criminal case and a process is under way to determine whether to accept or deny the prosecution's report,"" Lee said, referring to his own trial on charges he played a key role in an insurrection. ""I am aware it is a serious and important situation, but please understand that I am restricted considerably,"" he said, suggesting his answers could work against him. Yeo In-hyung, former head of the Defense Counterintelligence Command (DCC), also attended the session as a witness but refused to testify. Yeo allegedly received orders from Kim to arrest and detain opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and then ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon, among others. The former commander did not respond to the question of whether he received a list of politicians to be arrested when martial law was in force, though he admitted that he gave a list of ""specific figures"" to then National Police Agency chief Cho Ji-ho and asked to locate them. Yeo also said that he asked Cho to send police officials to form a joint investigative body in line with the decree and operation plans. Hong Jang-won, former first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service, told the hearing that he received a phone call from Yoon instructing him to ""round them all up"" and help the DCC. As Yoon did not specify who to arrest, Hong called Yeo and learned of 14 to 16 figures subject to be detained at a command facility for probe, the former deputy director said. Yoon claimed that he called Hong twice on Dec. 3 but it was nothing to do with his martial law declaration. Yoon has defended his actions as a ""warning"" to the opposition party while denying giving orders to arrest politicians. hague@yna.co.kr graceoh@yna.co.kr(END)",(4th LD) Yoon acknowledges troop dispatch to election commission during martial law decree,Oh Seok-min,Yonhap News Agency,2025-02-04T23:41:36,2025-02-04T23:41:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.politico.eu/article/kremlin-russia-slams-us-donald-trump-ukraine-exchange-rare-earth-resources/,"A senior Russian official slammed United States President Donald Trump's proposal that he could militarily aid Ukraine in exchange for access to its valuable mineral rights. ""If we call things as they are, this is a proposal to buy help — in other words, not to give it unconditionally, or for some other reasons, but specifically to provide it on a commercial basis,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday. ""It would be better of course for the assistance to not be provided at all, as that would contribute to the end of this conflict,"" he added, about a war that was instigated by Russia. Trump announced Monday that he was “looking to do a deal with Ukraine” in which the U.S. would provide military aid for the war against Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for Ukraine’s ""rare earths."" ""We’re investing hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths, and I want security of the rare earths,"" he said in Washington, adding that Ukraine is ""willing to do it."" Ukraine has strategic reserves of titanium, lithium, graphite and uranium, which is crucial for its future economic stability and potentially part of the calculus in balancing immediate aid with long-term sovereignty over its resources. Some of the critical minerals are in areas currently under occupation by Russia, which has been waging war on Ukraine since 2014 and launched a full-scale invasion in 2022. Ukraine has not yet commented on Trump's proposal, but sharing resources with allies is part of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s ""victory plan"" for the war against Russia.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-to-deploy-team-to-doha-for-gaza-deal-parley-after-talks-with-trump-aides/,"WASHINGTON — Israel will dispatch a delegation to Qatar later this week for negotiations on the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said early Tuesday following meetings with senior Trump administration officials in Washington. The Gaza truce and plans for a second stage that would end the war and free remaining living hostages were expected to be a main topic of conversation when Netanyahu meets later Tuesday with US President Donald Trump, becoming the first foreign leader to visit the White House since the Republican returned to power last month. Netanyahu and senior aides huddled Monday night with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and National Security Adviser Michael Waltz at the prime minister’s Blair House guest lodgings near the White House. He also met with Evangelical Christian leaders, including incoming ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. “Israel is preparing for the working-level delegation to leave for Doha at the end of this week in order to discuss technical details related to the continued implementation of the agreement,” the office said in a statement following the meeting with Witkoff and Waltz. The PMO had indicated earlier that Netanyahu and Witkoff would discuss Israel’s stance regarding the ceasefire deal, after which Witkoff would speak to fellow mediators from Egypt and Qatar. Under the initial ceasefire deal, talks on the second stage were set to have started from the 16th day of the truce, which was Monday. The Hamas terror group has said it is ready to negotiate the second stage of the three-part ceasefire deal. Under the first stage, now in its third week, 33 hostages are slated to be released for nearly 2,000 Palestinian inmates, many of them hardened terror convicts. The second phase aims to secure the release of the remaining living hostages, with Israel withdrawing troops and ending the war. Trump, who has claimed credit for sealing the ceasefire after 15 months of war and prides himself on his dealmaking ability, is expected to push Netanyahu to stick to the agreement during the meeting. He is also expected to lean on Netanyahu to accept a deal to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, something he tried to do in his first term. Trump said Sunday that talks with Israel and other Middle Eastern countries were “progressing” — but then warned less than 24 hours later that there that were “no guarantees that the peace [in Gaza] is going to hold.” Witkoff said, however, that the halt in hostilities was still in place and that he was “certainly hopeful” the truce would stick. Netanyahu is facing heavy pressure from right-wing political allies within his cabinet to abandon the deal and resume the war to fully defeat Hamas, which has attempted to reassert its power in the Strip since fighting paused on January 19. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, head of the far-right Religious Zionism party, has threatened to quit the government and strip the prime minister of his Knesset majority. Netanyahu has said Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages abducted in the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, terror attack that triggered the war. Pressure from Trump — including a threat of “hell to pay” if no deal was clinched by January 20 — was seen as a key factor in getting the sides to ink the initial ceasefire deal last month. On Monday, a spokesman for Qatar’s Foreign Ministry said Doha was counting on Trump to reprise his use of the bully pulpit to push talks along. The tense situation around Gaza has become even more sensitive in recent weeks as Trump has repeatedly touted a plan to “clean out” Gaza, calling for its residents to move to neighboring countries such as Egypt or Jordan. Trump said the plan could be temporary or permanent, but the mass displacement of civilians from Gaza was strongly rejected by Cairo, Amman, the Palestinians and other regional players. Before leaving for Washington, Netanyahu said Israel’s wars with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and its confrontations with Iran had “redrawn the map” in the Middle East. “But I believe that working closely with President Trump we can redraw it even further, and for the better,” he said. The premier had initially been slated to leave Washington on Thursday, but announced Monday he would remain in Washington until Saturday night to fit in more meetings. He is slated to meet Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday along with a second Waltz meeting. On Thursday, he will travel to Capitol Hill for talks with Congressional leaders including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson. On Monday afternoon, Netanyahu held a meeting with Evangelical leaders in the US, who have been credited with helping turn Trump into a staunch Israel supporter. The meeting included Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor who is set to replace Jack Lew as ambassador to Israel. Lew, appointed by former US president Joe Biden, stepped down on January 20. In recent years, Evangelicals have forged close working relationships with political figures from Israel’s right wing and the settlement movement, many of whom are opposed to ending the fighting in Gaza. That could put them on a collision course with Trump, who has pledged to end wars in the Middle East. There were no public meetings planned with US Jewish community leaders, many of whom have had a rockier relationship with Netanyahu. The Gaza ceasefire deal has so far led to the release of 13 Israeli hostages held by terror groups in Gaza — five Thai nationals abducted in the same attack were also freed from Gaza in a separate deal — in exchange for some 600 security prisoners. Israel believes 79 hostages remain in Gaza, nearly half of whom are thought to be dead. The captives include scores kidnapped on October 7, 2023, and three others — including the body of a soldier — held by Hamas for over a decade. Relatives of hostages still in Gaza and many other Israelis are impatient for their freedom. “The suffering that the families are going through as this drags on is inhuman,” Nissan Kalderon, the brother of newly released hostage Ofer Kalderon, said Sunday. During the October 7, 2023 attack, Palestinian terror group Hamas led thousands of terrorists to invade southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 46,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.",Netanyahu to deploy team to Doha for Gaza deal parley after talks with Trump aides,"Lazar Berman, ToI Staff, AFP",The Times of Israel,2025-02-04T10:36:20,2025-02-04T10:36:20,gemini-2.0-flash

The attack took place at the Taysir checkpoint, close to the Palestinian village of the same name. The checkpoint is on a road leading from the Jordan Valley to the village and other Palestinian towns. The slain soldiers were named by the Israel Defense Forces as Sgt. Maj. (res.) Ofer Yung, 39, from Tel Aviv and Sgt. Maj. (res.) Avraham Tzvi Tzvika Friedman, 43, from Ein HaNatziv. Both served in the Ephraim Regional Brigade’s 8211th Reserve Battalion. Yung was a squad commander. According to an initial probe by the IDF, the gunman managed to sneak up to a military post at the checkpoint, where he opened fire on troops just before 6 a.m. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories The compound next to the checkpoint includes a watchtower and several structures, and it is manned by a squad of 11 soldiers and a commander.

The IDF’s probe found that the gunman approached the army post on foot undetected overnight. At dawn, the assailant surprised two soldiers who were getting up to leave the post to open the adjacent Tayasir checkpoint for Palestinian traffic. The soldiers, who were in full military gear, exchanged fire with the gunman at close range at the entrance to the post. One of the two soldiers was killed in the exchange of fire, and the second was wounded. From there, other soldiers stationed at the army post exchanged fire with the gunman for several minutes, during which he managed to enter the post itself and the entrance to the watchtower. The IDF said that the gunman did not go up to the top of the watchtower.

A backup team then arrived at the scene and opened fire on the gunman from outside the army post, causing him to flee. During the gunman’s attempts to run away from the post, one soldier from the backup team hurled a grenade at him, and others opened fire.

The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. Since then troops have arrested some 6,000 wanted Palestinians across the West Bank, including more than 2,350 affiliated with Hamas. According to the Palestinian Authority health ministry, more than 900 West Bank Palestinians have been killed in that time. The IDF says the vast majority of them were gunmen killed in exchanges of fire, rioters who clashed with troops or terrorists carrying out attacks. There has also been a significant uptick in settler violence against Palestinians since the start of the war. During the same period, 48 people, including Israeli security personnel, have been killed in Palestinian terror attacks in Israel and the West Bank, including some carried out by Israeli citizens. Another eight members of the security forces were killed in clashes with terror operatives during raids in the West Bank.","2 soldiers killed, 8 hurt in shooting attack at IDF checkpoint in northern West Bank",Emanuel Fabian,The Times of Israel,2025-02-04T09:49:50,2025-02-04T09:49:50,gemini-2.0-flash

The National Intelligence Service (NIS) disclosed the intelligence, confirming a recent report from The New York Times that North Korean soldiers who fought alongside Russian troops in battle against Ukraine have been pulled from the front lines in mid-January due to heavy casualties, citing Ukrainian and U.S. officials. ""Since mid-January, there have been no signs showing North Korean troops deployed to the Russian Kursk region engaging in battle,"" the NIS said. The spy agency echoed the news report, saying that heavy casualties appear to be one reason for the absence of North Korean troops, adding that efforts are under way to determine the exact reason. North Korea is estimated to have sent some 11,000 troops to support Russia in its war against Ukraine. Of those, 300 are believed to have been killed, with some 2,700 others wounded, South Korea's spy agency has told lawmakers.

https://www.rferl.org/a/rubio-trump-panama-canal-china/33300909.html,"U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited the Panama Canal on February 2, warning the host country that Washington will ""take measures necessary"" if it doesn’t curb Chinese involvement in the crucial waterway. Following the threats, Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino seemed to take that to heart as he said he addressed Washington's concerns over Beijing's purported influence by not renewing Panama's deal to join China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Mulino also announced further steps to cooperate on immigration, a major policy matter with the U.S. administration. The decision to not renew the 2017 memorandum of understanding to join the BRI marks an early move to calm Washington's concerns over Chinese influence in Panama. The BRI is Chinese leader Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative, and the globe-spanning infrastructure project has led to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese investment around the world. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said Rubio delivered a message from President Donald Trump stating that China's presence was a threat to the waterway and a violation of the U.S.-Panama treaty. ""Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable and that absent immediate changes, it would require the United States to take measures necessary to protect its rights under the treaty,"" Bruce said. Rubio did not specify the steps Panama needed to take or suggest what moves the United States might take in retaliation if measures were not taken. Mulino told reporters that Panama will seek to work with the United States on new investments, including infrastructure projects. ""I think this visit opens the door to build new relations…and try to increase as much as possible U.S. investments in Panama,"" he said. Trump has said he does not rule out military force over Panama -- remarks that irked many U.S. allies in Latin America and elsewhere. In comments on February 2, Trump claimed that ""China's running the Panama Canal."" ""That was not given to China, that was given to Panama -- foolishly -- but they violated the agreement, and we're going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen,"" Trump told reporters. Trump has also made remarks about the United States potentially purchasing the island of Greenland from Denmark -- which says it's not for sale -- and suggested Canada should annex itself to the United States, although the seriousness of those comments was not clear. China's business with the canal is mainly carried out through Hong-Kong based Hutchison Holdings, which operates two ports near the entrances to the waterway under a 25-year concession renewed in 2021. Rubio last week said that under the current status, China could theoretically use the ports to shut down the canal should a conflict break out between the United States and the Asian giant. The Panamanian president said his meeting with Rubio was cordial and respectful. He indicated it was possible to review some Chinese businesses in Panama, including the port concession. China has denied it plays any role in the operation of the canal and that it respects Panama's control over the waterway. ""Never ever has China interfered,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said last month and added that Beijing recognizes the canal as ""a permanently neutral international waterway.” The Panama Canal was built in a U.S.-led project, and Washington maintained control when it began operation in 1914, also holding the surrounding Canal Zone. In 1964, it began to negotiate the situation following deadly riots by Panamanians angered over foreign control of the waterway. After long, contentious negotiations, President Jimmy Carter signed the deal that gave the canal to Panama at the end of 1999.

https://www.politico.eu/article/france-pm-francois-bayrou-braces-for-a-week-of-4-no-confidence-votes/,"PARIS — French Prime Minister François Bayrou is planning to put his job on the line four times this week as he attempts to enact a long-overdue budget for 2025. The audacious gambit began Monday, when Bayrou pushed through part of the budget using a constitutional maneuver that allows the government to pass legislation without a vote, but that in turn allows opposition lawmakers to put forward no-confidence motions. Bayrou triggered the measure, Article 49.3 of the constitution, twice on Monday. The prime minister will employ the same maneuver twice more in the next week to pass all the remaining parts of the budget, according to a lawmaker from Bayrou’s camp. Opposition lawmakers will then have four separate opportunities to topple the government for a second time in less than two months, after having brought down former Prime Minister Michel Barnier in December over his spending plans. Votes on the first two no-confidence motions are expected Wednesday. Like Barnier, the centrist Bayrou is attempting to pass a slimmed-down budget aimed at cutting France’s massive deficit, although the current premier’s plans are less aggressive than those of his conservative predecessor. But while Barnier had targeted the far-right National Rally as a potential partner for his minority government, Bayrou has been courting the center-left Socialist Party. Though the party has voiced its displeasure with the budget, it said in a statement on X that it would not vote for the no-confidence motion linked to Bayrou’s spending plans because “France needs a budget.” However, the Socialists said they plan to put forward their own proposal to censure the government over what they believe is Bayrou’s refusal to uphold “republican values” — a shot at the prime minister over controversial comments he made on immigration last week. That measure could still topple the government if enough lawmakers support it, but that depends on what the National Rally decides to do. The party has not yet announced its plans. Though Le Pen and her troops are unlikely to vote for a no-confidence motion that criticizes Bayrou’s tough language on immigration, it’s not out of the question. The National Rally ended up voting for a measure criticizing the party as a means to take down Barnier’s government in December. Should the National Rally vote for the separate motion of no confidence linked to the budget, Bayrou would need the entire Socialist Party to fall in line to keep his job — which is not a given. Last month, when Bayrou faced his first no-confidence motion, eight Socialist MPs broke ranks and voted to bring him down.

https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-nuclear-russia-war-energy-power-grid-b6752eb180a9e85fbb75dda66962cfcd,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Moscow’s renewed attacks on Ukraine’s electricity infrastructure this winter have heightened scrutiny over the Ukrainian Energy Ministry’s failure to protect the country’s most critical energy facilities near nuclear power sites. Despite more than a year of warnings that the sites were vulnerable to potential Russian attacks, the Energy Ministry failed to act swiftly, current and former Ukrainian officials in Kyiv told The Associated Press. Two years of punishing Russian strikes on its power grid have left Ukraine reliant on nuclear power for more than half of its electricity generation. Especially vulnerable are the unprotected nuclear switchyards located outside the perimeters of its three functioning nuclear plants, which are crucial to transmitting power from the reactors to the rest of the country. “The switchyards that handle electrical routing from nuclear power plants are a vital component of Ukraine’s nuclear energy infrastructure — powering homes, schools, hospitals and other critical civilian infrastructure,” said Marcy R. Fowler, head of the office for research and analysis at Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens that focuses on reducing nuclear risk. “Given Ukraine’s heavy reliance on nuclear energy, military attacks on these switchyards would be devastating, severely impacting civilian life and undermining the resilience of the energy grid,” she said. Only in the fall, after Ukrainian intelligence agencies warned of potential Russian strikes targeting the nuclear switchyards, was action taken to begin building protection — far too late in the event of an attack, analysts said. “If two (nuclear switchyards) are hit, we are out of supply for a minimum of 30 to 36 hours, and there will be a huge limitation on energy supply for at least three weeks, best-case scenario,” said Oleksandr Kharchenko, a Ukrainian energy industry expert. He said it would take three to five weeks to transport and install new equipment, a miserable scenario for Ukraine’s people during the bitterly cold winter months. Even more worrying, nuclear switchyards also have a second critical function: delivering electricity to nuclear plants from the offsite grid that is essential to cooling their reactors and spent fuel. A disruption could potentially spell disaster, the U.N. nuclear agency has repeatedly warned since the Russian attacks began in August. And while Ukraine’s nuclear plants have backup emergency power systems, these “are designed to provide temporary support,” Fowler said. “Without functioning switchyards, the backup systems alone would not be sufficient to sustain operations or prevent safety risks during an extended outage.” Lawmakers cited failure to protect these sites in a resolution last month calling for the removal of Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko. The list of grievances, which also censured Haluschenko for alleged systematic corruption and inadequate oversight of the energy sector, must still be voted on by parliament. Haluschenko maintained at a news conference Tuesday the allegations were “a manipulation” and that fortifications for the electrical grid were “done.” But he would not answer direct questions about whether Ukraine’s nuclear switchyards in particular were protected. “Today we have light, we have no restrictions” on electricity, he said, suggesting that was proof that despite “massive attacks” on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, fortifications were in place. Delays in fortifying nuclear switchyards Russian attacks in November and December came dangerously close to the country’s nuclear power plants, causing five out of its nine operating reactors to reduce power generation. The attacks did not strike the nuclear switchyards about a kilometer (half-mile) away from reactor sites but came alarmingly close. The task of building protections for energy transmission substations, both nuclear and non-nuclear, fell to state and private companies, with the Energy Ministry supervising. Three layers of fortifications were ordered: sandbags followed by cement barricades capable of withstanding drone attacks and — the most costly and least complete — iron-and-steel-fortified structures. Following a government decree in July 2023, many state energy companies began immediately contracting to build first- and second-layer fortifications for their most critical power facilities. In the spring of 2024, the government repeated the urgent call to get the work done. But nuclear switchyards, under the responsibility of Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom, did not issue contracts to build second-layer concrete fortifications until this fall. By then, state energy company Ukrenergo, which manages the high-voltage substations that transmit power from the nuclear reactors to the grid, had already completed 90% of its 43 sites. The bidding process for two nuclear plants — in Khmelnytskyi and Mykolaiv — only started in early October, according to documents seen by the AP. The tender for the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant was even later, at the end of November. Construction is not expected to be completed until 2026, the contract documents said. A chorus of warnings is ignored Concerns over the delays were raised repeatedly in closed-door meetings and letters sent to energy officials over the last year, three current and former government officials told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the foot-dragging by the Energy Ministry. “We wrote officially to the Energy Ministry several times stating this problem over the last 12 to 14 months,” said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the former head of Ukrenergo, who was fired in September and blamed for the failures to protect the energy infrastructure — a move widely criticized as politically motivated. Energy Minister Haluschenko gave reassurances the situation was under control and prioritized other projects, including lobbying for parliamentary approval for the construction of costly nuclear reactors that take up to a decade to build. Ukraine’s Western partners were also repeatedly told “all” critical infrastructure was protected, according to two Western diplomats with knowledge of Western financial assistance to the country’s energy sector, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue. Energoatom did not respond to requests for comment from the AP about the delays, citing the sensitivity of the issue. Over the summer and again in December, Ukraine raised the alarm internationally about potential Russian attacks targeting nuclear infrastructure and compromising nuclear safety. In mid-December it convened an extraordinary session of the International Atomic Energy Agency after attacks a month earlier damaged electrical substations deemed crucial to Ukraine’s nuclear safety, heightening the possibility of a nuclear emergency. The U.N. nuclear agency sent teams in December to electrical substations at Ukraine’s Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and South Ukraine nuclear power plants to document damage and gathered evidence “highlighting the electricity grid’s vulnerabilities as a result of attacks,” the agency’s Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement in January. “These attacks impact grid stability and jeopardize the reliability of the off-site power supply, creating risks to nuclear safety,” Grossi said, warning of similar concerns at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest. The presence of the IAEA inspection teams led some in the Ukrainian government to believe the country’s nuclear sites were off-limits for Russian attacks, said a senior Ukrainian official who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the delays. But that has proven to be a major miscalculation. “Why didn’t they react?” Kudrytskyi, the former Ukrenergo director, said of the Energy Ministry’s failure to quickly respond to the series of warnings. “I don’t have an answer to that.” ___ AP journalists David Rising in Bangkok and Volodymyr Yurchuk in Kyiv contributed to this report.",Russian attacks near Ukrainian nuclear infrastructure heighten scrutiny of Kyiv's preparedness,"SAMYA KULLAB, HANNA ARHIROVA",AP News,2025-02-04T05:04:57,2025-02-04T17:16:05,gemini-2.0-flash

Sharaa was also tasked with forming an interim legislature and the Assad-era parliament was dissolved, along with the Baath party which ruled Syria for decades.

https://apnews.com/article/congo-goma-fighting-death-toll-900-debe16315e7b87b0647ce9b173dfae86,"GOMA, Congo (AP) — The Rwanda-backed rebels who seized eastern Congo’s key city of Goma announced a unilateral ceasefire in the region Monday for humanitarian reasons, following calls for a safe corridor for aid and hundreds of thousands of displaced people. The M23 rebels said the ceasefire would start Tuesday. The announcement came shortly after the U.N. health agency said at least 900 people were killed in last week’s fighting in Goma between the rebels and Congolese forces. The city of 2 million people is at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth and remains in rebel control. The M23 were reported to be gaining ground in other areas of eastern Congo and advancing on another provincial capital, Bukavu. But the rebels said Monday they did not intend to seize Bukavu, though they earlier expressed ambition to march on Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, a thousand miles away. “It must be made clear that we have no intention of capturing Bukavu or other areas. However, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions,” M23 rebel spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from Congo’s government. The rebels’ announcement came ahead of a joint summit this week by the regional blocs for southern and eastern Africa, which have called for a ceasefire. Kenya’s President William Ruto said the presidents of Congo and Rwanda would attend. Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies, or G7, urged parties in the conflict to return to negotiations. In a statement on Monday, they called for a “rapid, safe and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians.” Congolese authorities have said they are open to talks to resolve the conflict, but that such a dialogue must be done within the context of previous peace agreements. Rwanda and the rebels have accused the Congo government of defaulting on previous agreements. The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first briefly captured Goma then withdrew after international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world’s technology. The latest fighting forced hundreds of thousands of people who had been displaced by years of conflict to carry what remained of their belongings and flee again. Thousands poured into nearby Rwanda. The fighting in Congo has connections with a decades-long ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda said the group is “fully integrated” into the Congolese military, which denies the charges. On Monday, families desperate to identify their loved ones besieged morgues as body bags were loaded onto trucks for burials in Goma. A weeping Chiza Nyenyezi recalled how her son died from a gunshot injury after a bullet went through his chest. “His entire chest was open,” Nyenyezi said. Louise Shalukoma said her son’s body could not be immediately recovered from the streets because a bomb detonated as people tried to retrieve it. “My God, my fourth child, when I saw that he was dead I said, ‘Lord, what am I going to do?’” she lamented. “This M23 war came for me in Goma.” ___ Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria.

https://www.dw.com/en/south-africa-rejects-trumps-land-confiscation-claim/a-71491321,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday rejected assertions made by his US counterpart Donald Trump a day prior. Trump, without citing evidence, claimed that ""certain classes of people"" are being treated ""very badly"" in South Africa and that Ramaphosa's government was confiscating their property. As a result, Trump said the US would end all funding for the country. It appears that Trump's comments were referring to a law signed by Ramaphosa last month, which Trump claimed offered ""nil compensation"" for property seized by the government.  Originally introduced as a bill in 2020, the law	was intended as	 a mechanism to review the apartheid-era Expropriation Act of 1975 and align it with the current constitution. Trump leveled similar claims in 2018, saying white farmers were being run off their land and killed. South Africa's fraught attempts to redress the injustice of apartheid Speaking of South Africa's land reform policy, Ramaphosa said, ""The South African government has not confiscated any land (….) The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument."" The South African government says the bill does not allow it to arbitrarily expropriate land, adding that it must first seek to reach agreement with its owners. 	 Writing on the social media platform X, Ramaphosa described the bill as a, ""constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution,"" adding, ""We look forward to engaging with the Trump administration over our land reform policy and issues of bilateral interest."" Three decades after the collapse of South Africa's racist apartheid government in 1994, land ownership remains a contentious issue, with most farm property in the country still owned by whites.  What did Trump and his top advisor Elon Musk say?	 ""Terrible things are happening in South Africa,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social media account. ""The leadership is doing some terrible things, horrible things. So that's under investigation right now."" ""It is a bad situation that the Radical Left Media doesn't want to so much as mention,"" the statement continued. ""A massive Human Rights VIOLATION, at a minimum, is happening for all to see. The United States won't stand for it, we will act. Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!"" The thorny path toward redressing the historical injustices of the apartheid system has	been opposed by many conservatives and right-wing commentators. Elon Musk, who grew up in apartheid South Africa and has amplified such voices,	 is one of those calling out Ramaphosa. A key policy shaping member of Trump's inner circle, the world's richest man used his account on X —	which he owns — to attack Ramaphosa's policies as ""openly racist."" What aid does the US give to South Africa?	 Ramaphosa on Monday said, ""the US remains a key strategic political and trade partner for South Africa."" But, he added, beyond providing assistance for South Africa's PEPFAR anti-HIV initiative, ""there is no other significant funding that is provided by the United States in South Africa."" That aid funds 17% of the initiative according to the government in Pretoria. South Africa's currency, the rand, fell roughly 2% against the US dollar in the wake of Trump's comments, with South African stocks and its benchmark government bond taking a hit as well.

DW South Africa correspondent Dianne Hawker says that while most medication is provided by the government, many clinics rely on funds from USAID and PEPFAR to pay for staffing costs. Some clinics, run by local NGOs and funded by USAID, also provide different types of prophylactic treatment such as PREP, which is not available in government clinics. 	 Elon Musk on Sunday announced that his ""Department of Government Efficiency"" would shut down USAID, calling it ""a criminal organization."" On Monday he said the move had met approval from Donald Trump.	 In fiscal year	2023, USAID	disbursed $72 billion (€70.2 billion) in global assistance for	 everything from women's health in conflict zones to access to	 clean water, HIV treatments and	anti-corruption work. In 2024, it provided 42% of all humanitarian aid	 tracked by the United Nations. One last provocation — BRICS DW correspondent Hawker also points out that Trump is likely irked by South Africa's status as a member of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), an international alliance that has earned his ire. The BRICS group has suggested abandoning the US dollar as a primary trade currency but has not yet taken that step.	 The group is also growing as a potential counterweight to the US, having added Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates in 2024, something that no doubt displeases the US leader.

Along with an ongoing impeachment trial, Yoon has been also under criminal probe for insurrection that supersedes his presidential immunity from prosecution. A division of the Seoul Central District Court handling Yoon's case has scheduled the first pretrial hearing for Feb. 20, according to the sources. Yoon is not obligated to be present at the pretrial hearing as it is a procedural step conducted to review key issues and evidence before the formal trial begins. Yoon is accused of conspiring with former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun and others to incite an insurrection by declaring an unconstitutional and illegal state of emergency, despite the absence of any signs of war, armed conflict or a comparable national crisis. Yoon is also alleged to have sent military troops to the National Assembly in order to keep lawmakers from voting down the martial law declaration and to have planned to arrest key political figures. julesyi@yna.co.kr(END)",Criminal trial of indicted Yoon on insurrection charges to begin Feb. 20,Yi Wonju,Yonhap News Agency,2025-02-03T17:02:35,2025-02-03T17:02:35,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-official-russian-national-maxim-herkin-to-be-prioritized-in-2nd-stage-of-hostage-deal/,"ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 574 Senior Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk says that Maxim Herkin, kidnapped by Gazan terrorists from the Nova festival on October 7, 2023, will be released as a priority in the second stage of the deal. He also tells Russian outlet Sputnik that hostage Sasha Trufanov, a dual Russian-Israeli national, will be released imminently. “One of them, Trufanov, will definitely be released in the near future. He will be released despite the fact that he is a serviceperson, but it was decided to release him at the first stage of the deal,” the Hamas official says. Trufanov is a civilian and was abducted from his home, but Hamas classifies all male hostages under 50 as members of the military. “This is our response to Russia’s position on the Palestinian issue,” the Hamas official says. Trufanov, 28, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, alongside his mother, grandmother and girlfriend, while his father was murdered. The rest of his family was released in November 2023. He is on the list of the first 33 hostages to be released in the ongoing first stage of the hostage-ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Herkin has a 3-year-old daughter and is the primary provider for his mother and 11-year-old brother. He went to the Nova festival almost by chance, invited by friends at the last minute.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-president-travels-to-saudi-arabia-jordan-turkey/a-71489677,"German Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier met the de-facto ruler of Saudi	Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, on Monday as he kicked off a three-day tour of the Middle East. The first ever German head of state to visit the Kingdom, Steinmeier was welcomed to Riyadh with military honors before holding talks on the future of Syria after the fall of Bashar al-Assad and the situation in Gaza following the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. ""Saudi Arabia is a key player here in the region,"" Steinmeier said, adding that the Kingdom's power and influence have grown considerably in recent years. ""And as this influence grows, so does the	country's responsibility."" Both Germany	 and Saudi Arabia are in favor of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, but Berlin's reputation in the region has suffered as a result of its steadfast support for Israel's war in Gaza. Israel launched the war in response to the October 7, 2023, attack carried out by Hamas, which killed some 1,200 people and kidnapped	nearly 250. Israel's military has devastated the Gaza Strip, displacing 1.9 million of the enclave's 2.2 million Palestinian residents according to the UN, and killing at least 47,518 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Steinmeier again demanded the release of all Israeli hostages still held by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which Germany and the EU regard as a terrorist group, and called for further negotiations towards a two-state solution, ""an agreement which guarantees security for Israel and self-determination for Palestinians."" This is necessary ""to bring long-term stability and hopefully also peace to the region,"" he said. Other topics on the agenda included	Iran's weakened position in the region and changes in US foreign policy under President Donald Trump. While in Riyadh, Steinmeier was also expected to hold talks with representatives from various Saudi think tanks as well as to visit an arts center. Germany's Steinmeier to visit Jordan Steinmeier will depart for Jordan on Tuesday, where he will visit German service men and women at al-Azraq airbase, where Bundeswehr soldiers are stationed in the international fight against ""Islamic State (IS)"" terrorists. Jordan, which directly borders both Syria and Israel, is home to 2.39 million Palestinians and according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR,	 hosts the world's second-largest number of refugees per capita. Most of the 730,000 refugees officially registered with the UNHCR are displaced Syrians. Steinmeier is scheduled to meet with Jordan's King Abdullah II on Wednesday before departing for Turkey. The trip was initially planned to take place in November but was postponed due to the pending collapse of Germany's ruling center-left coalition, prompting snap elections to be held in late February. Steinmeier to outline German interests to potentially skeptical partners Steinmeier will wrap up his trip with a visit to Ankara, Turkey, where he will hold talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday evening. Turkey, which is currently home to some 3.2 million Syrian refugees, has seen its influence in the region rise following the fall of Assad, and Steinmeier is expected to discuss plans to stabilize the war-torn nation with Erdogan. Steinmeier's office says the president will clearly articulate German interests in the region during his trip. He may, however, face skepticism in talks as many Arab countries seem to have lost faith in Germany as an honest broker in the region due to Berlin's support for Israel's war. Germany has supported the two-state solution laid out in the Oslo Accords, signed by Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1993, and is one of the leading international donors to the Palestinian Territories. But its continued support for Israel, and its opposition to charges of genocide made against Israel at the International Court of Justice,	 are likely to leave lingering	consternation among regional	partners.

During theEuroMaidan Revolution, Sarkisyan reportedly organized the hired pro-government thugs (""titushky"") who harrassed pro-EuroMaidan protesters. After the full-scale war broke out, Sarkisyan organized the ""Arbat"" Separate Guards Special Purpose Battalion fighting against Ukraine. The unit is reportedly made up of ethnic Armenians, many of whom have criminal records. While someinitial reportssuggested that Sarkisyan was killed in the blast, Kommersant wrote that he was hospitalized and is in critical condition. According to the Telegram channel 112, Sarkisyan is in a coma, and his leg had to be amputated. The blast was caused by an unidentified explosive device, with Russian law enforcement services suspecting a murder plot, TASS reported, citing authorities. The explosion reportedly occurred when Sarkisyan and his guards were entering the building. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine is yet to comment on the explosion. Russia's Investigative Committee has launched an investigation into the blast. While there is no evidence linking Ukraine to the explosion, Ukrainian intelligence services have been connected to a number of high-profile assassinations in Russia and Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine during the full-scale war.

https://apnews.com/article/japan-space-jaxa-h3-rocket-satellite-7ce09f5e2710451393226665d208e3b5,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s space agency said on Sunday it successfully launched a navigation satellite on its new flagship H3 rocket as the country seeks to have a more precise location positioning system of its own. The H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 6 satellite lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island. Everything went smoothly and the satellite successfully separated from the rocket as planned about 29 minutes after the liftoff, said Makoto Arita, H3 project manager for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA. Officials said it is expected to reach its targeted geospatial orbit in about two weeks. Japan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with four satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 6 will be the fifth of its network. Michibiki’s signals are used to supplement American GPS and will further improve positioning data for smartphones, car and maritime navigation and drones. Japan plans to launch two more navigation satellites to have a seven-satellite system by March 2026 in order to have a more precise global positioning capability without relying on foreign services, including the U.S., according to the Japan Science and Technology Agency. By the late 2030s, Japan plans to have an 11-satellite network. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, noting the successful launch in a statement later Sunday, promised that his government will make further effort to “maximize” the use of the navigation satellite system so that more people can smoothly access positioning data. Sunday’s launch, delayed by a day due to the weather, was the fourth consecutive successful flight for the H3 system after a shocking failed debut attempt last year when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload. Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security and has been developing two new flagship rockets as successors to the mainstay H2A series — the larger H3 with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and a much smaller Epsilon system with the aerospace unit of the heavy machinery maker IHI. It hopes to cater to diverse customer needs and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market.",Japan launches a navigation satellite on a new flagship rocket for an improved positioning system,Mari Yamaguchi,AP News,2025-02-02T11:39:21,2025-02-02T22:58:46,gemini-2.0-flash

The North Korean foreign ministry's Institute for Disarmament and Peace issued the criticism in a press statement following President Donald Trump' executive order last week to pursue a ""next-generation"" missile defense shield for the U.S. and allied territories. The plan signaled a potential acceleration of the U.S. missile defense modernization in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to nuclear powers, the institute claimed in the statement reported by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). It also claimed that the U.S. would evidently accelerate its joint development of a system to intercept hypersonic missiles with Japan and other allies while deploying more high-tech defense systems in South Korea, such as the terminal high altitude area defense (THAAD). The institute accused the U.S. of accelerating its pursuit of military hegemony, saying it warrants North Korea's continued development of its self-defense capabilities anchored in nuclear deterrence.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/02/americas/panama-china-belt-and-road-initiative-rubio-visits-intl-latam/index.html,"President Donald Trump reiterated his vow to “take back” the Panama Canal on Sunday, warning of “powerful” US action in an escalating diplomatic dispute with the Central American country over China’s presence around the vital waterway. “China is running the Panama Canal that was not given to China, that was given to Panama foolishly, but they violated the agreement, and we’re going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen,” Trump told reporters. Hours earlier, the diplomatic stir caused by Trump’s repeated and publicly stated desire for the US to retake control of the canal had appeared to ease after Secretary of State Marco Rubio, making his first overseas trip as the top US diplomat, met with Panama’s President Raúl Mulino. Though Mulino told Rubio that Panama’s sovereignty over the canal was not up for debate, he also said he had addressed Washington’s concerns over Beijing’s purported influence around the waterway. Panama would not renew a 2017 memorandum of understanding to join China’s overseas development initiative, known as theBelt and Roadinitiative, Mulino said, also suggesting that the deal with Beijing could end early. Mulino told reporters that Panama will seek to work with the US on new investments, including infrastructure projects. “I think this visit opens the door to build new relations … and try to increase as much as possible US investments in Panama,” he said. Related articleTrump’s ambition to retake the Panama Canal could have a heavy cost During the meeting, Rubio told Panama’s president and Foreign Minister Javier Martínez-Acha that concerns over China’s “control” of the Panama Canal may mean the US has to “take measures necessary to protect its rights” per a longstanding treaty on the neutrality and operation of the canal. The canal was returned to Panama undera 1977 treaty, which allows the US to intervene militarily if the waterway’s operations are disrupted by internal conflict or a foreign power. Today, more cargo than ever runs through the canal than it did during the years of US control. Mulino said Sunday he doesn’t think there is a real risk that the US would use military force to retake the canal. Mulino also said Panamanian authorities are carrying out an audit on a company linked to China that operates two terminals around the canal. “We have to wait until that audit ends before we can reach our legal conclusions and act accordingly,” Mulino said. The company in question is thePanama Ports Company, part of a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings. Hutchinson Ports is one of the world’s largest port operators, overseeing 53 ports in 24 countries, including for other US allies such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. As CNN has previously reported,Hutchison does not control access to the Panama Canal. Workers at their two ports only load and unload containers onto ships and supply them with fuel. Three other ports in the vicinity of the canal are operated by competing companies providing similar services. Related videoTrump doesn’t rule out using military to take control of Panama Canal Mulino also said Panamanian authorities spoke with Rubio about the possibility of expanding a migrant repatriation flightprogramto remove foreign nationals who don’t have the legal basis to be in Panama, insisting that the US would have to shoulder the costs. Asked to clarify if migrants would come to Panama and subsequently be transferred to their respective countries, Mulio said, “Yes. Exactly … We can do that, without a problem, under the total cost of the US. Panama won’t invest a single dollar in it.” The program,signed in July, is aimed at reducing irregular migration through the Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. Mulino said Sunday that those repatriated could include migrants from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and other countries.

https://www.dw.com/en/saudi-arabia-wants-to-support-syria-says-al-sharaa/a-71485678,"The visit by Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa to the Gulf Arab state could signal his government's strategy of moving away from Iranian influence. Ousted leader Bashar Assad was backed by Tehran. Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, landed in Saudi Arabia on Sunday for his first international trip since his rebel militant group ousted former President Bashar al-Assad in December. After meeting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Syria's interim president said Saudi Arabia was committed to supporting the war-torn country. ""We held a long meeting during which we felt and heard a genuine desire to support Syria in building its future,"" al-Sharaa said in a statement on Telegram. The interim Syrian leader's trip to Riyadh is being widely seen as a sign of his government's interestin aligning itself more closely with the Gulf and away from Iran. Iran spent an estimated $30–50 billion (almost €29 billion to €48 billion) in Syriato ensure the Bashar Assad regime's stability over the last thirteen years. Which countries win, which lose from the upheaval in Syria? On the other hand, Saudi Arabia had been among the Arab nations that poured money into insurgent groups that tried to topple Bashar Assad during Syria's civil war. However, rebels found themselves beaten back as Assad, supported by Iran and Russia, fought the war into a stalemate in Syria. What do we know about the trip? Al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, landed in Riyadh alongside his government's foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani. The two men traveled on a Saudi jet, with the Saudi flag visible on the table behind them. Syria's new three-star, tricolor flag flew next to Saudi Arabia's own at the airport as al-Sharaa in a suit and tie walked off the plane. Shoring up support for lifting international sanctions on Syria is a major topic of discussion during the trip, according to Saudi media outlets.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-840308,"Defense Minister Israel Katzon Sunday said that either drone threats from Lebanon will stop existing or Hezbollah itself will stop existing. Speaking from anIDFposition in Lebanon in a meeting with Division 146 Commander Brig.-Gen. Yiftah Norkin, Katz stated, “Israel will not accept the launching of drones from Lebanon.” Several days ago, the IDF shot down a drone within Lebanese territory that did not appear to be attacking but rather collecting intelligence about Israeli defense positions. “I advise the successor of the successor of Nasrallah not to make a mistake regarding Israeli determination as his predecessors did – lest he pay a heavy price,” the defense minister said. Katz was referring to Hassan Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for over 30 years until he was killed by the IDF on September 27, after which he was briefly replaced by Hashem Safieddine, who himself was killed on October 3, after which he was replaced by Hezbollah’s current leader, Naim Qassem. Further, he encouraged IDF troops there to maintain a zero-tolerance policy for even the smallest ceasefire violations by Hezbollah. Originally, the military was expected to withdraw from southern Lebanon on January 26, some 60 days after the ceasefire with the terrorist group was signed. However, after Israel asked for a 30-day extension, saying that the Lebanese military had still inadequately enforced preventing Hezbollah from returning to southern Lebanon, the US and Lebanon agreed to extend the IDF withdrawal deadline to at least February 18. Throughout essentially the whole ceasefire, Hezbollah has been careful not to fire on Israeli territory, but it has regularly probed IDF positions from the ground and recently used a drone from the air. In Gaza, the air force had fired on two separate cars – one in the morning and one in the early afternoon – both of which tried to avoid inspection moving from central Gaza to northern Gaza. Unconfirmed reports stated that at least one person was killed and several were wounded in one of the incidents, with no clear reports on the second. Reports first started to stream out about the event around 9:45 a.m. Sources confirmed the strike at around 1:00 p.m., but the military remained publicly silent for more than another hour. Video footage on social media appeared to show a vehicle on a road moving northward near the Mediterranean Sea suddenly exploding. In the morning incident, the IDF said it only undertook distancing or warning fire but was probing how the episode had turned out. In the afternoon incident, the military said that before targeting the car, it took some precautions to avoid striking Palestinian civilians, such as using a precision weapon and following the car from the air long enough to wait for it to be farther away from civilians. However, the IDF did not address whether the car’s passengers could have been arrested or if they presented any immediate danger, signifying that current rules of engagement for cars that avoid a check may be to strike the car from the air without attempting an arrest. Military sources later confirmed that firing from the air is currently the main option available to the military in such a case. It may be more difficult for the IDF to carry out an arrest given that it has withdrawn much of its forces to external defense lines, and many of the inspections are now reportedly being carried out by a mix of private contractors, and American and Egyptian military inspectors. The IDF did not say how many people were killed or wounded in either incident. To date, since the January 19 ceasefire, there have been very few such incidents; generally, there has been almost no fighting at all. Where there have been minor departures from the ceasefire, it was mostly brief attempts by Gazans to probe Israeli interim defense withdrawal lines to see if they could get through or how close they could get, with IDF forces responding with distancing fire. It was unclear if the incidents were a limited move to stop narrow violations or part of some larger strategy, or if they were related from the perspective of Gazan terror.",Israel Katz warns Hezbollah against launching drones over Lebanon border,YONAH JEREMY BOB,The Jerusalem Post,2025-02-02T10:20:00,2025-02-02T16:48:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/turkiye-open-to-hosting-palestinian-prisoners-freed-by-israel-fm-fidan-114035/,"Türkiye is willing to accept Palestinians released from Israeli prisons as part of the ongoing ceasefire agreement, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said during an official visit to Qatar. Speaking at a joint press conference with Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani in Doha, Fidan stated that Türkiye, along with other nations, is prepared to host freed Palestinian detainees if required under the terms of the agreement. “As part of the cease-fire agreement, one of the conditions involves ensuring that certain freed Palestinian prisoners do not remain in Palestinian territories. To support the agreement, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed that Türkiye is willing to host them, along with other countries,” Fidan said. He stressed that ensuring the implementation and continuation of the cease-fire is a priority, adding that other nations must also fulfill their commitments to maintain stability. Fidan reaffirmed Türkiye’s position against the forced displacement of Palestinians, stating that Ankara fully supports the Cairo Declaration, which calls for the protection of Palestinian rights and an end to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. “We oppose any plans to displace the Palestinian people from Gaza or force them to relocate to other countries. It is everyone’s duty to stand against such attempts,” Fidan said. “The ceasefire in Gaza must continue. Israel needs to move away from preventing the delivery of aid to Gaza. The international community must play its part. We are totally against the project of expelling the Palestinian people from Gaza and sending them to other countries. This is really a proposal against humanitarian law.” Fidan stated that everyone should stand against it. The Turkish foreign minister also addressed regional security concerns, stating that Türkiye is closely watching the new administration in Syria regarding its stance on the terrorist organization PKK “We are closely following the new Syrian administration’s approach toward PKK and will not tolerate any situation where terrorism finds a foothold in Syria,” he said. Fidan underlined that Türkiye remains committed to preventing the presence and expansion of terrorist organizations in its southern borders and will take necessary measures to ensure regional stability. The Syrian people must take control of their own administration and transition process. As neighboring countries, we are in communication on how we can assist in this matter. Significant steps need to be taken regarding the reconstruction of the country and its urgent needs. We are working together to find immediate solutions to Syria’s pressing issues. The lifting of international sanctions is crucial. The unification of armed groups under a national army is important. The fight against terrorism is also a key issue. The Damascus administration continues its efforts to reach out to and find a solution regarding the YPG issue. As Türkiye, we are closely monitoring these developments. Our hope is that the issue can be resolved without bloodshed. However, we cannot tolerate terrorism taking root in Syria. Ensuring an uninterrupted ceasefire in Gaza is a priority for us. After the ceasefire, we have observed difficulties in delivering aid to the region. Israel must abandon its obstructive approach. As Türkiye, we have great sensitivity on this issue. We are making every effort to deliver aid in the best and fastest way possible. During Syria’s transition process, we are in close communication with both Syria and our regional partners. There was a need for a cabinet, and with the formation of a government, we believe major uncertainties will be eliminated. At the end of his speech, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan addressed recent issues with the United States in response to a question. “We have shared this issue with our American friends many times. At this point, the ideal outcome would be to clarify the real’security issue’ for the Americans. The core issue here is that the YPG is providing detention services for Daesh prisoners and managing the camp population. Other than this, there is no additional security concern.” Fidan stated that the YPG lacks independent capability in the fight against Daesh and terrorism, emphasizing that the group itself is a terrorist organization. “Türkiye, Iraq, Syria, and Jordan have the capability to combat Daesh together. We have already held preliminary discussions, and we hope to take concrete steps as four nations,” Fidan said. Fidan also expressed Ankara’s expectation that the United States will abandon policies that pose a threat to Türkiye’s security. “We hope that our American friends will abandon this policy, which threatens Türkiye. At the same time, we can work towards an alternative formula that ensures Daesh detainees remain in prison.” He also noted that the new administration in Syria has expressed readiness to take responsibility in this matter, while Türkiye is also prepared to provide full support. “We hope that with the decision of Mr. Trump, the ongoing mistake in the region will come to an end. This issue not only fuels instability in the region but is also an open wound damaging Türkiye-U.S. relations. We wish for this matter to be resolved.” During his visit, Fidan held discussions with Qatari officials regarding bilateral relations, the Gaza ceasefire, and broader Middle East security concerns. “Türkiye and Qatar have strategic relations and this relationship contributes greatly to the peace, security and prosperity of the region,” FM Fidan said. “We talked about what needs to be done for Syria’s urgent needs. Syria’s outstanding problems need an international solution,” he added. “The people have urgent problems that require solutions. As Türkiye and Qatar, we are working in close cooperation on what can be done. Certain projects have already been finalized, and our goal is to bring them to life,” Fidan concluded.",Türkiye open to hosting Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel:	FM	Fidan,Newsroom,Türkiye Today,2025-02-02T15:13:46,2025-02-04T13:33:56,gemini-2.0-flash

He added that joining another bloc,the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean (PEM) convention, could be a ""good first step"" towards a new customs agreement. Labour has left open the possibility of joining PEM, but has ruled out rejoining the EU's customs union, which the UK left in 2021. Conservative shadow minister Andrew Griffith accused Sir Ed of wanting to ""take us back to the past"". PEM allows tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The Lib Dems say the UK should join it as a first step to rejoining the UK-EU customs union, which allows tariff-free movement of goods between EU member states - but prevents members striking their own trade deals. The party's ultimate aim is for the UK to rejoin the European Union - but it has only started campaigning on the issue since the general election. Downing Street says Sir Keir's meeting with EU leaders on Monday - the first time a British prime minister has been invited to such a gathering since the UK left the EU in 2020 - is focused on defence and security cooperation. The prime minister hosted German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at Chequers, his official country retreat in Buckinghamshire, on Sunday, and said he hoped the EU had seen a ""manifest difference"" in the government's approach since Labour took power in July. Sir Keir told reporters that he wanted to see closer ties on defence and energy, as well as on trade and economic issues. Sir Ed told BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that opening talks on a new EU customs union could ""turbo-charge"" relations with the 27-country bloc. He added that his party believed such a deal could be in place by 2030 ""at the latest"". He has also written to Reeves asking her to commission the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to explore the potential impact a new customs deal with the EU could have on the UK economy. The forecasts then should be made public as part of the OBR's forecasts, due to be published alongside the Spring Statement on 26 March, he suggested. Earlier this month, the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic told the BBC he was open to Britain joining PEM as part of a post-Brexit ""reset"". On the possibility of the UK joining the arrangement, the prime minister's official spokesman has previously told reporters: ""We've always said that we want to look at ways to reduce barriers to trade whilst remaining within our clear red lines. ""The arrangement that's being discussed is not a customs union. ""Our red line has always been that we will never join our customs union, never re-join the single market, no freedom of movement, but we're just not going to get ahead of those discussions."" Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of ""trying to reopen the divisions of the past and edge us back into the EU"", after having ""opposed us every step of the way"" while the previous Conservative government brought the UK out of the EU. Speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, shadow trade secretary Andrew Griffith said his party wanted to see good trade relations with the EU, but that the ""much greater opportunity right now"" was with striking a deal with the US. He urged the government to ditch itsdeal to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islandsto Mauritius and ""apologise a little bit"" for previous comments about Trump made by Labour ministers to improve US trade prospects. This could also help the UK avoid tariffs imposed by the USon some of its other trading partners, he suggested. Foreign Secretary David Lammy described Trump as a ""tyrant"" and ""a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath"" in 2018, but hascalled these criticisms ""old news""since entering government.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-heads-to-washington-to-meet-trump-hoping-to-redraw-middle-east/,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left on Sunday for Washington, where he is to meet later this week with US President Donald Trump, declaring before boarding his flight that cooperation with the new administration could redraw the Middle East. Netanyahu said his meetings in the US capital “will deal with important, critical issues facing Israel and the region — victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages, and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components, an axis that threatens the peace of Israel, the Middle East, and the entire world.” Speaking in English before boarding the plane, he said that the fact that he is the first foreign leader to meet Trump in the White House since the latter’s inauguration is “a testimony to the strength of the Israeli-American alliance. It’s also a testimony to the strength of our personal friendship.” “The decisions we’ve made in the war have already changed the face of the Middle East,” Netanyahu declared alongside the state’s official plane, Wing of Zion, which took him to Washington. “Our decisions and the courage of our soldiers have redrawn the map. But I believe that working closely with President Trump, we can redraw it even further, and for the better.” “I believe that we can strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace, and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength,” he said. Netanyahu was apparently referring to ties with Saudi Arabia. Israel is pushing for the establishment of a negotiating team to hold talks on official relations with the Gulf state, the Kan public broadcaster reported Saturday, adding that the Trump administration wants to achieve peace between Jerusalem and Riyadh as part of the US president’s vision for a “Golden age of peace in the Middle East.” The move would expand on the Abraham Accords, through which Israel established relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco during Trump’s first term in office. Saudi Arabia did not join the 2020 accords and has never recognized Israel. Normalization with Saudi Arabia has been all but shelved due to the war in Gaza as well as Riyadh’s demands that Israel establish a diplomatic horizon for a future Palestinian state. However, Trump said ahead of his return to the White House last month that he hoped to use the momentum of the Gaza ceasefire deal to expand the Abraham Accords to include Saudi Arabia. US special envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff has said that Qatar, which along with the US and Egypt, mediated the Gaza ceasefire, is also a candidate for normalization. Netanyahu’s visit comes at a critical moment in a complex, three-phase ceasefire with Hamas that halted the war in the Gaza Strip that the Palestinian terror group started in October 2023 and that is to see the release of all the hostages held by terror groups in the coastal enclave. The new Trump administration was involved in mediated negotiations for the ceasefire even before the president was inaugurated earlier this month, and he is eager to see the plan completed. Netanyahu, however, is facing pressure from the far-right flank of his coalition to restart the fighting after the completion of the first, six-week stage of the deal. Under the terms of the ceasefire, talks over the second stage are supposed to begin this week, but Netanyahu appears to be keeping his options open until he has met with Trump on Tuesday. As the prime minister departed to Washington, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called him to “strengthen our grip and sovereignty” over the West Bank, while describing Trump as “a lover of Israel.” The Palestinians want the West Bank, which is controlled by Israel and includes some 140 Israeli settlements, as part of a future state. “A great deal is at stake – complete victory in Gaza, the destruction of Hamas and the return of all our hostages, strengthening our security on all borders – in Syria, Lebanon, and of course against the head of the octopus, the Iranian regime and the nuclear threat. This danger must be removed,” Smotrich declared Sunday in a video message aimed at Netanyahu. “We must strengthen our grip and sovereignty over the homeland in Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the biblical name for the West Bank. Smotrich has threatened to bolt the government if the war is not restarted, while fellow far-right party Otzma Yehudit has already left the coalition in protest of the deal. Without Smotrich’s Religious Zionism party, the government would lose its majority in the Knesset. From a position of strength, Israel is “making peace, forging alliances, and strengthening its position,” Smotrich continued. Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition National Unity party, also wished Netanyahu success on his trip, declaring that it is critical for Israel’s future. 	”The meeting with President Trump is of paramount importance for advancing the return of all our hostages, coordinating the response to the Iranian challenge, expanding the circle of normalization, and removing Hamas rule,” Gantz tweeted. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer was accompanying Netanyahu to Washington, as was government hostage coordinator Gal Hirsch. Also on the plane was Dr. Eyal Heller, a senior cardiologist at Sheba Medical Center. Netanyahu, who has a history of heart issues, was fitted with a pacemaker at the hospital in 2023. There was no statement from Netanyahu’s office about why Heller was on the trip, but it may indicate a desire to keep a close eye on the prime minister’s health, especially after he underwent prostate surgery in late December. The day before he sits down with Trump, Netanyahu is to hold a meeting with envoy Witkoff, to initiate talks on the second stage of the hostage release deal with Hamas, which are slated to begin that day, the Prime Minister’s Office said Saturday. Witkoff was deeply involved in the ceasefire negotiations even before Trump’s January 20 inauguration. Reports have increasingly indicated, however, that Netanyahu is seriously entertaining the possibility of resuming the war after the first phase of the deal, as the far-right members of his governing coalition have demanded, rather than continuing on to the second phase. Alongside reports that Netanyahu had canceled a meeting with top Israeli negotiators, Channel 12 reported on Saturday evening that the premier was considering appointing Dermer as head of Israel’s negotiating team for the remaining hostage talks with Hamas. He would take over the role from Mossad chief Barnea. According to the report, Barnea would remain on the team alongside Bar and Alon, while Dermer would oversee the talks. The report claimed that Witkoff has expressed that he would prefer to work with Dermer and has reservations about working with the current negotiating team. The PMO denied the reports. So far, 13 Israeli hostages have been freed as part of the deal, which mandates the release of 33 so-called “humanitarian hostages” during its first 42-day phase, with fighting stopped in the Strip. Five Thai hostages have also been freed outside of the framework of the agreement. The three-phase deal’s later stages are subject to negotiations with the stated goal of reaching a “sustainable calm” in the enclave, alongside the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, the release of more Palestinian security prisoners, and an Israeli withdrawal from the Strip. The hostages are among the 251 people kidnapped on October 7, 2023, when some 3,000 Hamas-led terrorists burst into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, amid rampant acts of brutality and overt targeting of civilians. Seventy-six of the 251 hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 34 confirmed dead by the IDF.","Netanyahu heads to Washington to meet Trump, hoping to ‘redraw’ Middle East","Lazar Berman, Sam Sokol, ToI Staff",The Times of Israel,2025-02-02T10:19:40,2025-02-02T14:10:21,gemini-2.0-flash
https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250131005200315?section=national/defense,"SEOUL, Feb. 2 (Yonhap) -- The Navy has launched a new fleet command that will operate multiple destroyers, including those equipped with Aegis combat systems, in efforts to better respond to North Korea's military threats at sea, officials said Sunday. ""The Republic of Korea Navy Task Fleet Command, a core unit of the maritime three-axis system against North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, which also protects the country's maritime transportation routes, was launched as of Feb. 1,"" the Navy said in a release. The maritime three-axis system refers to the maritime version of the military's three-pronged deterrence structure comprising the Kill Chain preemptive strike platform, the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation system and the Korea Air and Missile Defense. In the event of a contingency, the command will send key destroyers to seas near the Northern Limit Line, the de facto inter-Korean maritime border, and detect and intercept North Korean missiles while conducting precision strikes on core targets, according to the Navy. The new command operates 10 destroyers and four auxiliary ships, including the new 8,200-ton Jeongjo the Great destroyer equipped with radar-evading functions and the newest Aegis combat system, according to the Navy. Ships built under South Korea's next-generation destroyer project, referred to as KDDX, will also be assigned to the new command upon completion, it added.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250202000500315?section=nk/nk,"SEOUL, Feb. 2 (Yonhap) -- North Korea on Sunday accused the United States of stepping up weapons aid to allies in what it called an attempt to cement its hegemonic status, saying such weapons provisions are still not sufficient to ""save"" South Korea from a strategic deficiency. The North's state media made the accusation after the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency recently announced proposed sales of weapons to South Korea, which will include BQM-177A subsonic sea-skimming aerial targets for Aegis-equipped destroyers and GQM-163 target drones. ""The U.S., the world's biggest war merchant, is getting worked up, more than ever, on its weapons sales scheme to nations that follow (the U.S.),"" the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in a commentary, stressing that such sales to South Korea are increasingly becoming ""persistent."" The KCNA claimed such arms provisions to the South reflect the U.S.' attempt to destroy the balance of power in the region and solidify its hegemonic status. ""No weapons aid from the U.S. can redeem (South Korea) from its fate of strategic deficiency ... the U.S. will not be able to realize its ambition due to our righteous power,"" it said. The commentary came as the North has long denounced military cooperation between South Korea and the U.S., calling joint military drills between the allies rehearsals for invasions while using them as a pretext for provocations. Last week, Pyongyang vowed to maintain ""the toughest counteraction"" to the U.S. as long as it rejects the country's sovereignty and security interests.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/irans-revolutionary-guards-unveil-underground-missile-facility-for-naval-warfare/,"The naval arm of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps unveiled a new underground missile facility on the south coast in footage aired by state television Saturday, two weeks after unveiling an underground naval base. “Hundreds of cruise missiles capable of countering enemy destroyers’ electronic warfare are stationed in these underground cities,” the station said in its report. “The systems are being kept hundreds of meters underground and can be operational in a very short time,” it said, without giving an exact location of the base. “These systems and missiles can be armed and fired from hundreds of kilometers away and can hit targets far out at sea.” IRGC chief General Hossein Salami toured the base with naval arm commander Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri. The report also unveiled a new model of cruise missile dubbed Ghadr-380 which Tangsiri said had “anti-jamming capabilities” and a range of more than 1,000 kilometers (over 600 miles). He said the new missiles could “create hell for enemy vessels.” Last month, the Guards unveiled an underground naval base for assault boats operating in Iran’s southern waters, which include the Gulf and the strategic Strait of Hormuz. In early January, Iran’s armed forces began a series of exercises, dubbed Eqtedar (Might in Farsi), which are set to continue until mid-March. The drills have included naval maneuvers that saw the unveiling of an advanced reconnaissance ship as well as exercises on safeguarding Iran’s nuclear facilities from attack by Israel or the United States. The military exercises come as Iran waits to see what policy US President Donald Trump will follow in his second term. During his first term that ended in 2021, Trump pursued a policy of “maximum pressure” against Iran, withdrawing the United States from a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and major powers, and reimposing biting sanctions.",Iran’s Revolutionary Guards unveil underground missile facility for naval warfare,AFP,The Times of Israel,2025-02-01T20:25:03,2025-02-01T20:25:03,gemini-2.0-flash

Israel later released 183 Palestinian prisoners that had been held in its jails, who were met by jubilant crowds in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Here's how the day unfolded: We're closing our live coverage nowbut you can keep up to date with the latest updates in our news story. Joe InwoodBBC News correspondent This deal was never going to be without controversy or critics, especially on Israelâ


Israel says. During the first six-week phase of the deal, a total of 33 hostages should be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. In addition, Hamas is still holding two men seized after crossing into Gaza from Israel before the war - Avera Mengistu, 27, an Ethiopian-Israeli dual national, and Hisham al-Sayed, 35, a Bedouin Arab, as well as the body of a soldier killed during a conflict in 2014. In the second phase, the remaining living hostages are to be released, and in the final phase, the bodies of dead hostages are to be handed over. We can now bring you the latest images from the occupied West Bank of jubilant scenes after the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Large crowds gathered around buses carrying prisoners in the town of Beitunia, west of Ramallah, as well as in Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip, as Israel confirmed the release of all 183 Palestinian prisoners due to be freed today. This comes afterthree Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas earlier today in Gaza. Israeli authorities say all 183 Palestinian prisoners due to be freed today have been released. The prisoners were transferred from the Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank and Ketziot prison in southern Israel ahead of their release, a spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service says. Earlier, we reported onscenes of Palestinian prisoners arriving in Ramallahin the occupied West Bank and being reunited with loved ones. Some of the prisoners released today have been serving life or lengthy sentences. We're seeing live footage now of buses pulling up in Khan Younis, Gaza. Palestinian prisoners are exiting the bus where they are being met by huge and jubilant crowds. Some of the freed prisoners are hanging out of the windows of the buses, waving at the large crowds that have gathered. Earlier, 25 Palestinian prisoners were released in the West Bank as part of the ceasefire deal. Alice CuddyReporting from Tel Aviv Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their communities in northern Gaza this week under the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. We've been speaking on the phone today with Ashraf al-Dous who has returned to his neighbourhood in Gaza City and says he was shocked by the scale of damage caused by Israeli bombing. ""It really a mess,"" he says. ""The situation is catastrophic."" He adds that most floors in his apartment building have been destroyed. ""I didn't expect the situation to be like this - it's too much,"" he says. He adds that some people, including his father, have headed back to the south after seeing the scale of destruction. As we reported in our last post, the Rafah crossing has reopened today to people for the first time since May 2024. Buses carrying wounded and sick Palestinians have been forming queues at the border and are beginning to cross into Egypt. The EU's civilian border mission has been deployed to the border to support the transfers. The Rafah crossing, which is on Gaza's southern border, has been a key humanitarian corridor throughout this war, where aid trucks are able to enter the country. The crossing is also the only exit for people able to flee since the start of the war. However, humanitarian organisationshave long criticised the closure of the crossingfor reducing the amount of aid getting into the Gaza Strip. Ambulances from Gaza cross into Egypt via the now re-opened Rafah border crossing The first group of wounded Palestinians needing medical treatment have been evacuated to Egypt from Gaza after the re-opening of the Rafah border crossing in the south of the territory - it is the sole crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-run health ministry says 50 patients have left Gaza to Egypt via the crossing to access medical care. The crossing - which Gaza calls its ""gateway to the world"" - has been closed to civilians since May 2024. We can now bring you some reaction to the release of three Israeli hostages - Yarden Bibas, Ofer Kalderon and Keith Siegel - earlier today in Gaza. A statement by Israeli President Isaac Herzog reads ""each one deserves the time to rehabilitate and rebuild their lives"". In a post on X, he says the country has ""worried and awaited their return"". Herzog adds he remains ""deeply concerned for the fate of our beloved Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas"", the family of Yarden Bibas who were taken hostage but have not returned with him. ""As an entire nation we hold them in our hearts,"" Herzog says. ""We will not rest nor be silent until we return all our sisters and brothers"". As we've been reporting, a bus carrying Palestinian prisoners has arrived in the occupied West Bank. Crowds gathered around the bus as the prisoners made their way out of the vehicle. Hamas-affiliated Safa news agency says 25 freed Palestinian prisoners were on the bus that arrived in the town of Beitunia, west of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank. Joe InwoodBBC News correspondent The contrast with Thursdayâ

We're now seeing several buses leaving Ofer prison, in Israel, where many of the 183 Palestinian prisoners due to be released today have been held. It's not yet been confirmed if any of the 183 prisoners are on board the buses. As a reminder, three Israeli hostages were freed this morning, as more than 180 Palestinian prisoners will be released today as part of the exchange - following the ceasefire deal that began on 19 January. Alice CuddyReporting from Tel Aviv It begins with a phone call, with a location. Once the details are received, a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross sets off in vehicles marked with the humanitarian organisation's logo to pick up the hostages in Gaza. The group, which acts as a neutral intermediary in the handover, then brings them to Israeli troops on the outskirts of Gaza. Across the border in Israel, reception centres have been set up, where the released hostages meet with medical personnel and their families. They are assigned a physician, a nurse and a social worker. After receiving initial treatment at the reception point, the surviving hostages are transferred in a ""specially adapted"" helicopter to a hospital elsewhere in the country. ""We tell themâ

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg0m5n8g0do,"A small medical transport plane crashed into several buildings in the US city of Philadelphia on Friday evening, killing all six people on board and at least one other person on the ground, the mayor has confirmed. The jet was on a medical transport trip, heading to Tijuana, Mexico, with a short stop-over in Missouri. It was carrying a child patient and her mother, along with two pilots, a doctor and paramedic. They were all Mexican nationals. But just one minute after take-off, the Learjet 55 plummeted to the ground. Videos show the plane coming down quickly and sparking a huge fireball. Nineteen others were injured, though Mayor Cherelle Parker said that number could still change. Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, Philadelphia city managing director Adam Thiel said it would probably be ""days or more"" until officials are able to confirm ""the number of folks who perished in this tragedy and the outcome of those who were injured"". He added that there is still ""a lot of unknowns about who was where"" when the crash happened. The girl being transported to Mexico had just finished medical treatment for a life-threatening illness at Shriners Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. Earlier on Friday, staff had thrown her a party to celebrate, hospital spokesman Mel Bower said. He added that staff who treated her had been ""impacted very deeply"" by news of the tragedy. The flight was bound for Springfield, Missouri for a short stop-over, before continuing onto Tijuana. The plane left Northeast Philadelphia Airport at about 18:07 local time (23:07 GMT) on Friday, rose to 1,500ft, turned slightly right, then slightly left, then began a steep descent, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) officials said. The crash occurred less than four miles (6.4km) away. Flight logs show the plane was in the air ""for only a minute"" before it crashed, Mayor Parker said. No issues were reported from the plane to air traffic control, and controllers who attempted to get a response from the flight crew did not receive one, NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said. Witnesses described shrapnel damaging cars and sending burning debris into the streets. Photos of the aftermath show mangled, burnt-out vehicles and a deep gouge in the street. Fire officials said there were five separate fires sparked by the crash, but they were contained and extinguished. The crash happened just blocks from the Roosevelt Mall, a three-storey shopping centre in a densely populated part of Philadelphia, the fifth biggest city in the US. The area is filled with terraced housing and shops. Many properties lost power after the crash. One man said he was driving when he heard a whirring sound and then a loud explosion. ""Everyone just started screaming,"" he said. Another witness told local media the explosion ""lit up the whole sky"". ""I just saw a plane basically hit the building and it exploded. The sky lit up and I pulled over and basically, it was just real bad around here,"" the witness told WPVI-TV, describing the crash as feeling like an earthquake. Ryan Tian, 23, toldthe Philadelphia Inquirerhe was getting dinner when he saw a ""massive fireball"" that turned the sky orange. ""I thought we were getting attacked by something,"" he said. In a statement, Jared Solomon, a local state representative, said: ""In a time of profound tragedy, I was inspired to witness hundreds of our first responders sprinting towards danger to ensure the safety of our neighbourhood."" Mayor Parker said emergency workers had worked through the night at the crash site. Officials said the wreckage site is large, spanning up to six blocks, and there is also debris in remote areas too. The mayor told city residents that if they find any debris, to call 911 and ""don't touch anything"". NTSB investigators are still looking for the cockpit voice recorder - which is ""likely damaged and may be fragmented"", Ms Homendy said. She said investigators would be collecting debris for ""several days, possibly extending into weeks"". ""I do want to stress this is an active investigation scene. The debris is scattered, it is very dangerous, so I encourage everyone to stay out of the accident site,"" she said. The FAA is also investigating. Did you witness the crash? If it is safe to do so,get in touch. In a statement, President Donald Trump said his administration was ""totally engaged"". ""So sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More innocent souls lost,"" he said. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she ""mourns the passing of six Mexicans in the aviation accident"", in a statement translated from Spanish. ""My solidarity is with their loved ones and friends,"" she added. The Mexican foreign ministry said personnel at the country's consulate in Philadelphia were in contact with next-of-kin. This crash comes just two days after amuch larger collision happened between a commercial jet and a military helicopter in Washington DC, where officials believe all 67 people aboard both aircraft were killed. It was the deadliest plane crash in the US in more than 20 years. Ms Homendy said on Saturday her agency was ""highly skilled"" and it was ""not unusual for the NTSB to be investigating two major accidents"".

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250201003800315?section=news&input=rss,"SEOUL, Feb. 1 (Yonhap) -- Crowds of protesters gathered in central Seoul on Saturday in massive rallies, either opposing the ouster of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol or urging his removal from office, following his recent indictment under physical detention. An estimated 3 million people, according to organizers, thronged Seoul's central Gwanghwamun area, waving the Taegeukgi and the Stars and Stripes and calling for Yoon's release in a rally opposing his impeachment. Last Sunday, prosecutors indicted Yoon with physical detention on insurrection charges over his short-lived declaration of martial law on Dec. 3. The following week, the National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon, prompting a Constitutional Court trial to decide whether to reinstate or permanently remove him from office. ""Yoon Suk Yeol will be made to come back if 10 million people gather on March 1. (We) can change everything, whether it's the Constitution or anything else,"" said conservative activist pastor Jeon Kwang-hoon, who spearheaded the rally, referring to a mass gathering he is planning on that date. The police's unofficial estimate of the participants was 38,000. Similar rallies in support of Yoon were also held near the National Assembly in Seoul's western Yeouido district and in front of the Seoul Central District Court in southern Seoul. Waving the Taegeukgi and the Stars and Stripes, protesters chant slogans supporting impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol in a rally in Seoul's central Gwanghwamun area on Feb. 1, 2025. (Yonhap) Also in Gwanghwamun, a separate rally urged a Constitutional Court ruling to oust Yoon, with 100,000 participants according to organizers. The police estimated the number at 6,000. Participants called for the ""immediate removal"" of Yoon, while also criticizing acting President Choi Sang-mok for vetoing a parliamentary bill calling for a special counsel investigation into Yoon over the martial law declaration. ""Let us completely end, with the power of the people, the insurrection scheme by the anti-Constitution forces, including Yoon Suk Yeol and the (ruling) People Power Party,"" said Kim Min Moon-jung, who spearheaded the rally against Yoon. Some 240 traffic police personnel were mobilized in Seoul as the mass rallies caused traffic congestion and other inconveniences.

https://apnews.com/article/germany-kohler-former-president-obituary-f7863ea64ca2420f8566b6b18254dbdc,"BERLIN (AP) — Horst Köhler, a onetime head of the International Monetary Fund who became a popular German president before stunning the country by resigning abruptly in a flap over comments about the country’s military, has died. He was 81. Köhler, who was head of state from 2004 to 2010, died Saturday morning in Berlin after a short illness, surrounded by his family, the office of current German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement. Köhler was little known to most Germans and a stranger to front-line politics before he won the presidency. His nomination was greeted by the mass-circulation daily Bild with the headline “Horst Who?” However, he built up high popularity ratings once in the job, something that he achieved in part by positioning himself as an outsider to the country’s political elite. He occasionally refused to sign bills into law due to constitutional concerns and didn’t always make himself popular with the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose choice he was for the presidency — a largely ceremonial job but often seen as a source of moral authority. In July 2005, Köhler agreed to dissolve parliament and grant struggling then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder an unusual early election. He declared that Germany faced “giant challenges” and that “our future and the future of our children is at stake.” Merkel won power, but nearly blew a huge poll lead after her talk of deeper reform turned off voters. Köhler also talked less of economic change in later years and was strongly critical of financial markets during the banking and economic crisis — describing them as a “monster” that hadn’t yet been tamed. Amid criticism that he appeared to have little to say after winning a second term, Köhler resigned in dramatically abrupt fashion on May 31, 2010. He cited criticism over a radio interview he gave following a visit to German troops in Afghanistan. In that broadcast, he said that for a country with Germany’s dependency on exports, military deployments could be “necessary ... in order to defend our interests, for example free trade routes.” That was taken by many as relating to Germany’s unpopular mission in Afghanistan, although his office later said he was referring to anti-piracy patrols off the coast of Somalia. Many wondered whether that was the real reason for the sometimes thin-skinned Koehler’s resignation, with critics speculating that he had simply become fed up with a lack of backing from Merkel — for whom his resignation was an embarrassment. In foreign policy, Köhler won praise for trying to draw attention to the needs of Africa. He became the second German president to address Israel’s parliament, telling the Knesset: “I bow my head in shame and humility before the victims” of the Holocaust. Köhler also paid attention to relations with eastern neighbor Poland, making it the first foreign destination of both of his two terms and saying he would like the country to become as important a partner for Germany as France. Köhler, the son of ethnic German farmers from Romania, was born on Feb. 22, 1943, in Skierbieszow, in Nazi-occupied Poland. His family fled to Germany after the war — first to Leipzig in what became communist East Germany, then to West Germany in 1954. Before rising to the presidency, Köhler had a long record as an efficient behind-the-scenes official. Starting in the early 1980s, he worked for more than a decade in the Finance Ministry under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who once called him “a treasure” and relied on him in economic diplomacy. He helped draft the legal framework for Europe’s single currency, the euro, and played a role in negotiating German reunification in 1990. He later served as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In 2000, Köhler emerged as Schröder’s backup choice for the IMF leadership. He won American support after Berlin’s first candidate, Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser, was rejected by the United States as too lightweight. U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow later praised Köhler’s tenure, saying that “he transformed the institution in terms of its transparency ... and worked to develop better crisis prevention tools and more effective crisis management.” Merkel, then Germany’s opposition leader, brought him back to Germany as her surprise choice for the presidency four years later, securing his election by a parliamentary assembly. In a letter of condolence to Köhler’s wife, Eva Louise, President Steinmeier wrote Saturday that “many people in our country will mourn with you. For in Horst Köhler we have lost a highly esteemed and extremely popular person who achieved great things — for our country and in the world.” “It was above all his approachability, his infectious laughter and his optimism, his belief in the strength of our country and in the energy and creativity of its people that won him so many hearts. But it was also his often clear and by no means always comfortable admonitions and speeches that won him recognition,” Steinmeier wrote. Köhler is survived by his wife, daughter Ulrike and son Jochen.",Former German President Horst Köhler dies at 81,GEIR MOULSON,AP News,2025-02-01T10:04:01,2025-02-01T10:04:01,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/02/01/2003831148,"Thousands of protesters yesterday took to the streets of Manila, urging the Philippine House of Representatives to impeach Vice President Sara Duterte. Duterte faces three impeachment complaints over alleged misconduct and misuse of millions of US dollars in government funds, but legislators have yet to tackle them just days before Congress adjourns next week ahead of the May midterm elections. The 46-year-old vice president, who is estranged from Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, but remains his constitutional successor in case he is unable to perform his duties, has denied the allegations. Marcos has urged Congress not to pursue Duterte’s impeachment, calling it a “storm in a teacup” that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities. Protesters mostly wearing white shirts held placards calling for Duterte’s removal and chanted “Impeach. Impeach Sara now,” as they gathered beside Manila’s busiest avenue. About 4,000 people took part in the morning rally, police said, with authorities deploying 7,400 riot police to keep the peace. Those numbers were dwarfed by a mammoth rally held on Jan. 13 by a conservative sect that opposes Duterte’s impeachment. Philippine Representative Percival Cendana, who backs one of the impeachment complaints, joined yesterday’s rally and urged his colleagues to move fast. Every day of inaction “condones the impunity, the abuse of power and the harassment that Duterte is doing to our country’s leaders,” he told reporters. An impeachment would only proceed if it is backed by a third of House of Representatives members, and an impeached official can be removed from office by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. “The Filipino people are here, ready to stand for truth and justice. Let’s not fail them,” Cendana said.","Thousands protest, calling on House to impeach Duterte","AFP, MANILA",台北時報,2025-01-31T20:00:00,2025-01-31T23:03:58,gemini-2.0-flash

The stage is decorated with images of slain Hamas military leaders and a slogan in Hebrew that says “Zionism will not win.” Dozens of armed and masked Hamas gunmen form a cordon around the stage. The handover is also brief and orderly compared to the scenes of chaos in the release of Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes on Thursday when they were forced to march through a seething mob. The IDF says the Red Cross has notified the military that hostage Keith Siegel was handed over to it. The Red Cross is now bringing him to IDF and Shin Bet forces inside Gaza to then be escorted out of the Strip, the military adds.

The Navy's 4,900-ton Nojeokbong landing ship carrying some 370 personnel departed for Thailand earlier in the day to join the Cobra Gold exercise, slated to take place in 11 regions in the country from Feb. 25 to March 7. For the exercise led by the Thai and U.S. armed forces, the South Korean military plans to mobilize six assault amphibious vehicles, two K55 self-propelled howitzers and a K77 fire direction center vehicle. The troops will take part in an array of field exercises, including amphibious landing drills with Thai, U.S. and Singapore troops, and joint naval operations. The South Korean Marine Corps will also participate in the Cross Dock drills for the first time, during which Korean assault amphibious vehicles will be deployed to Singapore's amphibious transport dock. The Cobra Gold drills will also include special operation drills, humanitarian civil assistance activities and cyber defense training. Launched in 1982, the annual Cobra Gold exercise focuses on training multinational forces for a range of procedures aimed at stabilizing a region embroiled in a virtual armed conflict.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24760vqdz5o,"Mark Carney, the frontrunner to be the next Canadian prime minister, has said his country is ""going to stand up to a bully"" after US President Donald Trump said he would unveil tariffs of 25% on Canada. Speaking exclusively to BBC Newsnight, 59-year-old Carney said Canada will ""match dollar for dollar the US tariffs"". As well as levying a 25% tariff on Canadian imports on Saturday, the White House has announced tariffs of 25% on Mexico and 10% on China. Carney, who announced his run for leader of Canada's governing Liberal Party in January, is the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. He is currently one of five candidates in the running to succeed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - and has so far secured the largest support base among Liberal MPs. The leadership race will conclude on 9 March. The winner will replace Trudeau - who announced his intention to resign in January after nine years in office - both as prime minister and party leader. Canada is then required to hold a federal election to elect a new government on or before 20 October, with the Liberal party currently trailing their Conservative rivals in the polls. In response to the tariff announcement, Carney told Newsnight that ""President Trump probably thinks Canada will cave in"". ""But we are going to stand up to a bully, we're not going to back down,"" he said. ""We're united and we will retaliate."" The former Bank of England governor said the tariffs are ""going to damage the US's reputation around the world"". ""They're going to hit growth. They're going to move up inflation. They're going to raise interest rates,"" he said. He added that it's the ""second time"" in less than a decade that the US has ""in effect, ripped up a trade agreement with its closest trading partner"". In 2020, towards the end of Donald Trump's first term, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (UCMCA) came into effect - effectively an update to Nafta, the agreement between the three countries which had been in place since the 1990s. Economists have suggested the newly imposed tariffs could have a devastating immediate impact on Canada's economy - while also leading to higher prices for Americans. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. Outgoing Prime Minister Trudeau has said Canada's response will be ""forceful"" and ""immediate"" to the new tariffs. Trump said on Friday that Canadian oil would be hit with lower tariffs of 10%, which would take effect later, on 18 February. The president also said he planned to impose tariffs on the European Union in the future, saying the bloc had not treated the US well. The de minimis exemption was key to the huge growth of the Chinese online retailers. Mike Waltz had faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are locked in a game of chicken - despite wanting the same outcome. The technology giant says US tariffs will add around $900m to its costs this quarter. Foreign policy is rarely a big factor in Australia's poll - but the US president has changed that. Copyright 2025 BBC.

https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-840161,"Iraqi militias have indicated their support for a hostage exchange deal involving Israel and Hezbollah, according to a report by Amwaj Media on Friday. Sources close to Iraqi Shiite militias told Amwaj that a hostage exchange deal, swapping Israeli-Russian Elizabeth Tsurkov for Hezbollah fighters arrested by the IDF, was beginning to emerge. The sources indicated that the militias wanted to move forward with the deal but that Israeli intransigence had left the deal in limbo. They go on to say that Hezbollah is also eager for the swap, desperately needing a victory in the face of its decisive loss to Israel in 2024, Amwaj reported. The Iraqi government is also reportedly keen on the swap in order to further disentangle itself from regional conflicts. Tsurkov disappeared in March 2023 and was confirmed kidnapped by July. The Prime Minister's Office blamed Kataib Hezbollah, an organization closely associated with Iran, for the kidnapping. Despite the close association with Iran, Amwaj reported that there are several indications the kidnapping was unrelated to Iran. Instead, the sources indicated that the kidnapping may have been a result of intra-Shia rivalry. Tsurkov was researching Kataib's rivals in the Sadrist movement when she was kidnapped. Amwaj reports the kidnapping may have occurred on the belief Israel was attempting to establish relations with the Sadrists. Tsurkov was last seen in a video published by her captors soon after the start of the Israel-Hamas War, during which she referenced the war. Iraqi foreign minister Fouad Hussein reportedly told Axios reporter Barak Ravid on January 23 thatTsurkov was aliveand Iraq was working for her release. However, theIraqi government deniedhaving given the statements only two days later. Iraq's strict anti-normalization laws mean that if found guilty, one could face life imprisonment or execution.
