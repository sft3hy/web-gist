https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/al-shabaab-captures-strategic-somalia-town-it-presses-offensive-2025-04-16/,"MOGADISHU, April 16 (Reuters) - Al Shabaab fighters captured a town in central Somalia on Wednesday that government forces had been using as a staging area to drive back an offensive by the militants that has gained ground in recent weeks, residents and soldiers said.

Advances by theal Qaeda affiliate, which included briefly capturing villages within 50 km (30 miles) of Mogadishu last month, have left residents of the capital on edge as rumours swirl that al Shabaab could target the city.

The army has recaptured those villages, but al Shabaab continues to advance in the countryside, leading the government to deploy police officers and prison guards to support the military, soldiers have told Reuters.

Six residents and three soldiers said al Shabaab seized the town of Adan Yabaal, which lies around 245 km (150 miles) north of Mogadishu, in heavy fighting on Wednesday.

""After many hours of fighting we made a tactical retreat,"" said Aden Ismail, a military officer who transported injured soldiers to the nearby Hiiraan region.

The army and allied clan militias have been using Adan Yabaal as an operating base for raids against al Shabaab.

President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who hails from the area, visited the town last month to meet with military commanders there about sending reinforcements.

""If al Shabaab captures one town, that does not mean they overpowered us,"" Mohamud said in a speech on Wednesday, without directly naming the town. ""There is a big difference between a war and a battle.""

Al Shabaab, which has waged an insurgency since 2007 to seize power and rule based on its strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law, said in a statement that its forces had overrun 10 military installations during Wednesday's fighting.

""After early morning prayers, we heard a deafening explosion, then gunfire,"" Fatuma Nur, a mother of four, told Reuters by telephone from Adan Yabaal. ""Al Shabaab attacked us from two directions.""

National government officials were either not reachable or did not respond to requests for comment.

The fighting comes as the future of international security support to Somalia has grown increasingly precarious.

A new African Union peacekeeping mission replaced a larger force at the start of the year, but its funding is uncertain, with the United States opposed to a plan to transition to aU.N. financing model.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7pqzk47zo,"Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.

It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales.

The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.

Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.

The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.

The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.

Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words ""woman"" and ""sex"" are defined in the legislation.

He told the court: ""The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.

""But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.""

He added that the legislation gives transgender people ""protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender"".

Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears.

The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including ""sex"" and ""gender reassignment"".

Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by ""sex"" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, ""certificated"" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.

The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex ""for all purposes"".

For Women Scotland argued for a ""common sense"" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an ""immutable biological state"".

Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: ""Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex.

""Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling.""

First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement.

Heposted on social media: ""The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster.

""We will now engage on the implications of the ruling.""

Swinney added: ""Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.""

A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted ""in good faith"" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.

A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring ""clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs"".

""Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,"" the spokesman added.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenochdescribed the rulingas a ""victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious"".

She added: ""It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.""

Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: ""It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.""

But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: ""This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society.

""It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next.""

For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups.

Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender.

Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was ""shocked"" by the court ruling, arguing that it ""reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates"".

They added: ""This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services.

""It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.""

The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy overtransgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prisonand an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse whoobjected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room.

NHS Fife said it would ""carefully consider"" the court's judgement.

The judges ruled that interpreting sex as ""certificated"" rather than ""biological"" would ""cut across the definitions of man and ""woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way"".

They said a ""certified"" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian.

The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to ""function coherently"".

It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions.

The judges noted ""similar confusion and impracticability"" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces.

The judges added: ""The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.""

Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender.

However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs ""if it is proportionate to do so"".

Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman.

He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex.

But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be ""settled"" by this court case.

He told the BBC: ""It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.""

Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a ""reassessment"" of rules.

The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards.

For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law.

The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts.

Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was ""not limited to biological or birth sex"".

The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex.

The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers.

In contrast, if it restores aid soon, given that many estimates said that Hamas had enough food for at least around three months,the IDFcould avoid new claims of attempted starvation by Israel against the Gazan population.Trucks containing humanitarian aid from Jordan and international communities transfers into the northern Gaza Strip, October 22, 2024 (credit: IDF SPOKESMAN’S UNIT)However, Katz’s statement left many questions unclear.While he referenced private companies for handing out food to Gaza’s population, which he said would sideline Hamas as the party distributing food aid, he did not provide names or details.This is not the first time that Israel has tried to cut Hamas out of the food aid distribution chain.As early as January 2024, then-defense minister Yoav Gallant tried to initiate such a program in northern Gaza for the direct provision of food to Palestinian civilians without Hamas’s intervention, but the program was never workable and faced pushback within the government from hard-right ministers Betzalel Smotrich andItamar Ben-Gvir.Eventually, Israel tried to use the World Food Program and the World Central Kitchen to replace UNRWA for handing out aid, but each organization, at one point or another, withdrew due to being mistakenly struck by IDF forces.Even when the organizations returned, they either distributed the food directly to Hamas, or the terror group seized it from whoever it was given to.It is unclear how private contractors would have large enough and powerful enough armed forces to distribute food aid to over two million Palestinians throughout Gaza on a daily basis and would be able to stay in the field long enough to ensure that Hamas did not take it at some point.Burying food aid admissionSeemingly to try to dilute the admission and preempt attacks from Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, Katz buried the food aid admission in a longer statement about crushing Hamas, regaining all of the hostages, and threatening a wider war.Likewise, Katz claimed that Egypt is pressuring Hamas to give up its weapons, though the terror group has made it clear that such a condition is a non-starter. According to Israeli intelligence, Hamas has also rebuilt and is back up to 20,00
