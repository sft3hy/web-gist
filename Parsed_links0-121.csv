https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-iaea-zarif-tehran-c3a8afc699c670300b9521f1e2019ef7,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran confirmed Wednesday that the next round of nuclear talks with the United States this weekend will be held in Rome after earlier confusion over where the negotiations would be held. The announcement by Iranian state television came as Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian formally approved the resignation of one of his vice presidents who served as Tehran’s key negotiator in its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency, also arrived in the Islamic Republic on Wednesday. His talks may include negotiations over just what access the IAEA inspectors can get under any proposed deal. The state TV announcement said Oman will again mediate the talks on Saturday in Rome. Oman’s foreign minister served as an interlocutor between the two sides at talks last weekend in Muscat, the sultanate’s capital. Officials initially on Monday identified Rome as hosting the negotiations, only for Iran to insist early Tuesday they would return to Oman. American officials so far haven’t said publicly where the talks will be held, though Trump did call Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq on Tuesday, while the ruler was on a trip to the Netherlands. The stakes of the negotiations couldn’t be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear program if a deal isn’t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Pezeshkian praises former vice president while acknowledging his resignation The former vice president, Mohammad Javad Zarif, served as a key supporter of Pezeshkian in his election last year but drew criticism from hard-liners within Iran’s Shiite theocracy, who long have alleged Zarif gave away too much in negotiations. In March, Zarif tendered his resignation to Pezeshkian. However, the president did not immediately respond to the letter. Zarif has used resignation announcements in the past in his political career as leverage, including in a dispute last year over the composition of Pezeshkian’s Cabinet. The president had rejected that resignation. But on late Tuesday, a statement from the presidency said Pezeshkian wrote Zarif a letter praising him but accepting his resignation. “Pezeshkian emphasized that due to certain issues, his administration can no longer benefit from Zarif’s valuable knowledge and expertise,” a statement from the presidency said. The president in a decree appointed Mohsen Ismaili, 59, to be his new vice president for strategic affairs. In Iran’s political system, the president has multiple vice presidents. Ismaili is known as a political moderate and a legal expert. Grossi visit comes as Iran has restricted IAEA access Grossi arrived in Tehran for meetings with Pezeshkian and others. He met Wednesday night with Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on the social platform X after the meeting: “Cooperation with (the IAEA) is indispensable to provide credible assurances about the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme at a time when diplomacy is urgently needed.” Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency described Araghchi as briefing Grossi on the first round of talks with the U.S., while also urging the IAEA to “adopt a clear and transparent stance regarding threats against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities.” Both Israel and the U.S. have threatened to attack Iran’s nuclear sites if a deal can’t be reached to limit Tehran’s program. “As variety of spoilers are gathered to derail current negotiations, we need a Director General of Peace,” Araghchi wrote on X. “Our predisposition is to trust Grossi in mission to keep the Agency away from politics and politicization, and to retain focus on its technical mandate.” Since the nuclear deal’s collapse in 2018 with Trump’s unilateral withdraw of the U.S. from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its program, and enriches uranium to up to 60% purity — near weapons-grade levels of 90%. Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency’s most experienced inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that they could pursue atomic weapons, something the West and the IAEA have been worried about for years since Tehran abandoned an organized weapons program in 2003. Any possible deal between Iran and the U.S. likely would need to rely on the IAEA’s expertise to ensure Tehran’s compliance. And despite tensions between Iran and the agency, its access has not been entirely revoked. Iran’s foreign minister questions contradictory responses from US envoy Meanwhile, Araghchi on Wednesday warned the U.S. about taking contradictory stances in the talks. That likely refers to comments from U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who this week initially suggested a deal could see Iran go back to 3.67% uranium enrichment — like in the 2015 deal reached by the Obama administration. Witkoff then followed up with saying “a deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.” “Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,” he wrote on X. “It is imperative for the world that we create a tough, fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.” Araghchi warned America about taking any “contradictory and opposing stances” in the talks. “What is certain is that Iran’s enrichment (program) is a real, accepted matter,” he said. “We are prepared to build trust and address any potential concerns, but the core issue of enrichment itself is not negotiable.” ___ Karimi reported from Tehran, Iran.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7pqzk47zo,"Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales. The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people. The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women. The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words ""woman"" and ""sex"" are defined in the legislation. He told the court: ""The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. ""But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not."" He added that the legislation gives transgender people ""protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender"". Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears. The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including ""sex"" and ""gender reassignment"". Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by ""sex"" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, ""certificated"" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex ""for all purposes"". For Women Scotland argued for a ""common sense"" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an ""immutable biological state"". Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: ""Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex. ""Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling."" First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement. Heposted on social media: ""The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster. ""We will now engage on the implications of the ruling."" Swinney added: ""Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions."" A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted ""in good faith"" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement. A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring ""clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs"". ""Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,"" the spokesman added. Conservative leader Kemi Badenochdescribed the rulingas a ""victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious"". She added: ""It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so."" Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: ""It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK."" But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: ""This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society. ""It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next."" For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups. Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender. Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was ""shocked"" by the court ruling, arguing that it ""reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates"". They added: ""This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services. ""It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody."" The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy overtransgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prisonand an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse whoobjected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room. NHS Fife said it would ""carefully consider"" the court's judgement. The judges ruled that interpreting sex as ""certificated"" rather than ""biological"" would ""cut across the definitions of man and ""woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way"". They said a ""certified"" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian. The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to ""function coherently"". It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions. The judges noted ""similar confusion and impracticability"" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces. The judges added: ""The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct."" Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender. However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs ""if it is proportionate to do so"". Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman. He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex. But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be ""settled"" by this court case. He told the BBC: ""It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them."" Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a ""reassessment"" of rules. The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards. For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law. The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts. Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was ""not limited to biological or birth sex"". The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex. The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers. Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-850289,"Defense Minister Israel Katzon Wednesday confirmed that Israel is close to backtracking on a vow not to allow the provision of more humanitarian aid to Gaza before the Israeli hostages are returned and that aid could be restarted soon, though private companies would be used to circumvent Hamas. Katz’s admission follows a flurry of leaks in recent weeks that Israel would need to restore the flow of aid to Gaza soon if no new ceasefire deal is reached, given that it has been cut off for around six weeks. Israel had initially said it would permanently cut off aid and that there were no international law questions at stake, given the excess food that Hamashad obtained during the 40-day-plus ceasefire from January 19 to early March. The defense minister’s statement acknowledged the reality that without restoring aid soon, Israel could run into new questions of alleged starvation. In contrast, if it restores aid soon, given that many estimates said that Hamas had enough food for at least around three months,the IDFcould avoid new claims of attempted starvation by Israel against the Gazan population. However, Katz’s statement left many questions unclear. While he referenced private companies for handing out food to Gaza’s population, which he said would sideline Hamas as the party distributing food aid, he did not provide names or details. This is not the first time that Israel has tried to cut Hamas out of the food aid distribution chain. As early as January 2024, then-defense minister Yoav Gallant tried to initiate such a program in northern Gaza for the direct provision of food to Palestinian civilians without Hamas’s intervention, but the program was never workable and faced pushback within the government from hard-right ministers Betzalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir. Eventually, Israel tried to use the World Food Program and the World Central Kitchen to replace UNRWA for handing out aid, but each organization, at one point or another, withdrew due to being mistakenly struck by IDF forces. Even when the organizations returned, they either distributed the food directly to Hamas, or the terror group seized it from whoever it was given to. It is unclear how private contractors would have large enough and powerful enough armed forces to distribute food aid to over two million Palestinians throughout Gaza on a daily basis and would be able to stay in the field long enough to ensure that Hamas did not take it at some point. Seemingly to try to dilute the admission and preempt attacks from Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, Katz buried the food aid admission in a longer statement about crushing Hamas, regaining all of the hostages, and threatening a wider war. Likewise, Katz claimed that Egypt is pressuring Hamas to give up its weapons, though the terror group has made it clear that such a condition is a non-starter. According to Israeli intelligence, Hamas has also rebuilt and is back up to 20,000-25,000 fighters. IDF sources said there is still no concrete plan to engage new private contractors to distribute food aid to Gaza. Ben-Gvir responded to Katz’s statement in a post on X/Twitter, noting, “It’s a shame that we don’t learn from mistakes.” “As long as our hostages are languishing in the tunnels, there is no reason for a single grain of food or any aid to enter Gaza. Halting the aid is one of the central pressure points on Hamas, and returning it before Hamas is on its knees and has released all our hostages would be a historic mistake. “I will do everything in my power to ensure that this historic mistake does not happen, and I call on the prime minister and the defense minister not to take this foolish step, which would harm our ability to defeat Hamas and safely bring all our hostages home,” Ben-Gvir wrote. Following Ben-Gvir’s latest criticism of Katz for acknowledging that food aid to Gaza may resume in the future, the defense minister released a bizarre statement in which he said repeatedly that food aid would not be restored at this time, but contrastingly that it would be restored in the future.","Israel shifts Gaza aid to private sector, backtracks on Gaza aid provision, Katz confirms",YONAH JEREMY BOB,The Jerusalem Post,2025-04-16T10:59Z,2025-04-16T21:00Z,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250415-french-pm-bayrou-warns-trump-s-hurricane-has-made-france-vulnerable,"France urgently needs to reduce its budget deficit to confront a “tsunami of destabilisation” that includes a bellicose Russia and a trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister François Bayrou said on Tuesday. The upheaval caused by Trump’s tariffs and his decision to turn against traditional allies has shattered trust around the world, Bayrou said in unusually strident comments, warning France’s growing debt and larger budget deficits compared to European peers made it vulnerable. “The president of the United States has started a hurricane whose consequences will not end any time soon,” Bayrou said in a news conference meant to drum up support ahead of talks about the 2026 budget that pose a risk for his minority government. “As if war weren’t enough, a tsunami of destabilisation came to shake up the planet,” Bayrou said, saying the world had witnessed “a reversal of alliances that no one could have imagined” as he pointed to Trump’s treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office in February. Trump, Vance and Zelensky at the White House President Emmanuel Macron, treading a careful path of international diplomacy, has been less outspoken about Trump than his prime minister, who would traditionally be more focused on the domestic audience. Budget in the balance Bayrou’s predecessor Michel Barnier was toppled in December after he tried to pass a 2025 budget that would have cut spending faster to reduce a budget deficit that rose to 5.8 percent in 2024. Speaking on a podium where a sign read “the truth allows us to act”, Bayrou gave little concrete details on how he intended to cut government spending he said was too high. He ruled out increasing France’s overall tax take, among the highest in the world. He only said he wanted to wrap up consultations with lawmakers and stakeholders on the 2026 budget ahead of the usual September deadline and bring it forward to France’s national holiday on July 14. The government aims to cut the deficit this year to 5.4 percent of economic output as a first step towards bringing the shortfall back in line with a European Union ceiling of 3 percent by 2029. Bayrou, who relies on a minority government inherited from Macron’s failed gambit to call an early election in June last year, is especially dependent on the goodwill of Socialist lawmakers. The Socialist party, which is in the midst of a party leadership contest, has warned it could decide to pull the plug on Bayrou if the wealthiest in society were not part of efforts to reduce the deficit.

https://www.riotimesonline.com/venezuela-keeps-oil-output-above-one-million-barrels-in-march-opec-reports/,"Venezuela kept its crude oil production above one million barrels per day in March, according to the latest OPEC report. The country produced 1,048,000 barrels per day, up by 23,000 from February. This figure comes from direct sources, including Venezuela’s state oil company. Secondary sources, such as independent industry analysts, reported a lower figure of 911,000 barrels per day for March. Both numbers show a clear increase compared to the same period last year. The average production for the first quarter of 2025 reached 1,034,667 barrels per day, a 19.75% rise over the previous year. The price of Venezuela’s main crude blend, Merey, dropped to $61.10 per barrel in March from $64.96 in February. This price remains below global benchmarks, reflecting the heavier quality of Venezuelan crude and the challenges in marketing it. Oil exports remain Venezuela’s main source of foreign currency. Since 2017, production has dropped sharply. Venezuelan officials blame U.S. sanctions for this decline. These sanctions have limited Venezuela’s access to international markets and technology. The country’s oil sector saw a partial recovery after the U.S. relaxed some sanctions in late 2022. This allowed companies like Chevron to resume operations and export oil. Chevron’s involvement has been significant, accounting for about a quarter of Venezuela’s total oil production. However, the U.S. government recently replaced Chevron’s license with a more restrictive one. This change requires Chev দ্রুত to wind down its operations by late May. Other international companies, such as Eni and Repsol, also face new restrictions. These firms together contribute around 300,000 barrels per day to Venezuela’s output. Analysts warn that without these foreign partners, Venezuela’s production could fall below 720,000 barrels per day. The government is seeking new deals with countries like China and Turkey. Officials have announced a plan to boost domestic investment and technology. However, the sector faces technical and financial challenges. Venezuela’s oil industry stands at a crossroads. The country’s ability to maintain or grow output depends on new investment and access to markets. The next months will show if Venezuela can keep its oil sector afloat or face another decline.

The Harbin public security bureau said that the three operatives -- Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson -- had been engaged in cyberattacks targeting the Asian Winter Games held in the city in February. Investigations by Chinese technical teams revealed that the cyberattacks were carried out by the Office of Tailored Access Operations of the NSA. To conceal the origins of its attacks and secure its cyber weapons, the office used multiple affiliated front organizations to purchase IP addresses from various countries and anonymously rented servers located in regions including Europe and Asia. Investigations revealed that the NSA focused its pre-event cyberattacks on critical systems of the Asian Winter Games, including registration, arrival/departure management, and competition entry platforms, authorities said. These systems, essential for pre-event operations, stored vast amounts of sensitive personal data of individuals associated with the Games. From Feb 3, coinciding with the first ice hockey match, NSA cyberattacks peaked, primarily targeting critical operational systems such as the event's official information platforms. These systems were vital for ensuring the smooth running of the Games, and the NSA attempted to disrupt them to undermine their normal operations. Meanwhile, the NSA launched cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in Heilongjiang province, including energy, transportation, water resources, telecommunications, and defense research institutions, authorities said. Technical teams also discovered that during the Asian Winter Games, the NSA transmitted unknown encrypted data packets to specific devices running Microsoft Windows operating systems within the province. These packets are suspected to have been attempts to activate or trigger pre-implanted backdoors in the Windows systems, authorities added. Further investigations revealed that the three NSA operatives had repeatedly launched cyberattacks against China's critical information infrastructure and participated in cyber operations targeting companies such as Huawei. Technical teams also uncovered evidence implicating the University of California and Virginia Tech in the coordinated cyber campaign against the Asian Winter Games, authorities stated.",Chinese police put 3 US operatives on wanted list over cyberattacks,Xinhua,chinadaily.com.cn,4/15/25 9:13,4/15/25 9:13,gemini-2.0-flash

https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/new-armed-extremist-group-claims-responsibility-bombing-greeces-120770871,"ATHENS, Greece -- A new extremist group claimed responsibility Sunday for a bomb that exploded near the offices of Hellenic Train, Greece’s main railway services operator and the planting of another near the Labor Ministry in early February. The explosion Friday evening resulted in limited damage and no injuries. The perpetrators had forewarned of the explosion by calling two media organizations about 40 minutes before it happened. In a lengthy posting on the website Athens.indymedia.org on Sunday, the perpetrators, who styled themselves the Revolutionary Class Struggle, explained the reasons for their action, which they said was part of an armed struggle against the state. Revolutionary Class Struggle dedicated the bombings to “the Palestinian people and their heroic resistance” and paid tribute to Kyriakos Xymitiris, a man who was killed last year when the explosive device he was assembling exploded in a central Athens apartment. The explosion also came during widespread public anger over a 2023 railway disaster, Greece’s worst, in which 57 people were killed and dozens more injured when a freight train and a passenger train heading in opposite directions were accidentally put on the same track. The deadly accident exposed severe deficiencies in Greece’s railway system, including in safety systems, and has triggered mass protests led by relatives of the victims against the country’s conservative government on the occasion of the accident’s second anniversary. In its statement, which serves as a sort of manifesto, Revolutionary Class Struggle connects the accident with what it called the “murders” of the proletariat in the form of workplace accidents, by capitalists. Greece has a long history of politically motivated violence dating back to the 1970s, with domestic extremist groups carrying out small-scale bombings that usually cause damage but rarely lead to injuries. While the groups most active in the 1980s and 1990s have been dismantled, new smaller groups have emerged. Authorities are calling them a new generation of domestic extremists. “With the blood not yet dry, they attributed the (train) accident to human error and the ‘chronic deficiencies of the Greek state,’ in effect demanding even more freedom of movement for capital, more privatizations and new attacks on any remaining state-owned infrastructure,” the extremist group said. Hellenic Train, the operator of passenger and cargo train services, was once a subsidiary of state-owned Hellenic Railways. It was split and sold to Italy’s Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane in 2017. Hellenic Railways retains ownership and responsibility for the maintenance of the rail infrastructure, including the train stations.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote that ""Russian cruelty struck again,"" calling the attack ""barbaric"" in a post on X. More than 30 people were killed in the missile strike as people gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, according to officials. Images from the scene showed lines of black body bags lying on the side of the road, while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris. Video footage also showed fire crews as they fought to extinguish the shells of burned-out cars among the rubble from damaged buildings. A further 99 people were injured, including 11 children, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. Von der Leyen added that ""Russia was and remains the aggressor, in blatant violation of international law."" The attack on Sumy is the second large-scale attack to claim such a high number of civilian lives in just over a week. A deadly missile strike on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyâ	ms hometown of Kryvyi Rih on 4 April killed some 20 people, including nine children. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trumpâ	ms special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said that the Sumy attack crossed â	""any line of decencyâ	"" and that the White House remained committed to ending the conflict. â	""There are scores of civilian dead and wounded. As a former military leader, I understand targeting and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war,"" he said. Zelenskyy also called for a global response to the attack. â	""Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs. Whatâ	ms needed is an attitude toward Russia that a terrorist deserves,â	"" he said. EU Foreign Chief Kaja Kallas also condemned the attack on social media, writing of a ""horrific example of Russia intensifying attacks while Ukraine has accepted an unconditional ceasefire."" French President Emmanuel Macron said that the strike undermined Washington-led peace talks between the two sides. â	""Everyone knows: This war was initiated by Russia alone. And today, it is clear that Russia alone chooses to continue it â	"" with blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump,â	"" he wrote in a statement. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ""appalled at Russia's horrific attacks on civilians."" The strikes come a day after Russia and Ukraineâ	ms senior diplomats accused each other of violating a tentative US-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the three-year war. Russian forces hold the advantage in Ukraine, and Kyiv has warned Moscow is planning a fresh spring offensive to ramp up pressure on its foe and improve its negotiating position. Ukraine has endorsed a broader US ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet.","Russia 'was and remains the aggressor', says Von der Leyen following deadly attack on Ukraine's Sumy",Emma De Ruiter,Euronews,2025-04-13T12:43:01,2025-04-13T12:43:01,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/04/13/2003835086,"State-owned oil refiner CPC Corp, Taiwan (CPC, 台灣中油) plans to boost its procurement of US energy products — including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil — in response to US President Donald Trump’s 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese exports, sources said yesterday.President William Lai (賴清德) has said the government intends to expand purchases of US goods, including agricultural, industrial, and energy products, as part of its strategy to narrow the trade balance.The Ministry of Economic Affairs said it aims for US-sourced LNG to account for 30 percent of Taiwan’s total LNG imports. Last year, US LNG made up 10 percent of CPC’s imports, with the company sourcing from 14 different countries, the ministry said.CPC sources said the target could be met by ramping up existing LNG imports from the US or seeking new supply channels, such as LNG from Alaska. The company said it has inked a term sheet with select US firms certifying its intent to import LNG from Alaska, although the project could take five to seven years to come online.The company said that major US energy firms maintain diversified global investments and that it has an understanding with its partners to adjust delivery volumes based on demand and evolving circumstances.It also said it confirmed it would significantly increase LNG imports from the US over the next four years. It also plans to raise its purchases of US crude oil to help ensure a stable energy supply for the country.The company said it primarily imports sweet crude oil, or crude with a lower sulfur content, from the US and African countries, adding that sweet crude, while more expensive, was more environmentally friendly. It is also importing sour crude, or crude with higher sulfur content, from the Middle East, it added. While the company had been considering scaling back US sweet crude imports due to declining domestic demand for gasoline and diesel, it is now reassessing that decision in light of the government’s push for net-zero emissions and broader energy diversification policies.US-sourced crude has already increased from 44 percent to 60 percent of CPC’s total imports over the past three years. The rise was partly due to a fire at the company’s Dalin refinery’s heavy oil desulfurization unit on Oct. 27, 2022.

https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2025-04-12/eu-joint-defense-fund/,"Warsaw, Apr 12 (EFE).— Spain on Saturday proposed the creation of a new European financial instrument to fast-track large-scale defense projects, aiming to reduce EU reliance on US military support and respond swiftly to mounting security challenges. The plan, presented during an informal meeting of EU finance ministers in Warsaw, would also allow non-EU countries to participate, aiming to boost European defense spending in the short term. Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo outlined the proposal as a way to strengthen the EU’s autonomy in defense, particularly in light of the United States’ shifting stance under President Donald Trump regarding Ukraine and NATO contributions. “The proposal aims not only to increase defense spending immediately but also to use resources more efficiently by coordinating Europe’s security needs,” Cuerpo said. He described the fund as a “transitional solution” to expedite defense investments until more permanent financing, such as incorporating defense into the EU’s long-term budget, is in place. A Swift, Temporary Mechanism The proposed instrument would take the form of a temporary special-purpose entity, open not only to EU member states.It would be funded through voluntary contributions from participating countries, with the exact formula for contributions yet to be determined. The fund would support grants and loans for large-scale defense projects, complementing other EU financing sources, such as common debt issuance under existing or new programs. The Spanish Ministry of Economy also suggested tapping into the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone’s rescue fund with €400 billion in lending capacity, and leveraging the windfall earnings from around €200 billion in frozen Russian assets held in the EU. Spain argues that this new instrument could be established more quickly than long-term solutions like increasing the EU’s multi-annual financial framework, another proposal Madrid supports but acknowledges would take years to implement. “This is the moment for European solidarity…to support Ukraine and frontline Eastern nations. We must invest together in defense, which is a genuine European public good that benefits our citizens and strengthens our economic security,” Cuerpo said. Backing From Brussels and Beyond Spain’s initiative complements the European Commission’s proposed rearmament strategy, which includes loosening fiscal rules to boost defense spending, potentially mobilizing €650 billion over four years, and a €150 billion loan instrument funded through common debt issuance. European Commissioner for the Economy Valdis Dombrovskis welcomed the Spanish proposal, saying the commission is “ready to explore new options.” He noted that the Spanish proposal aligns with ongoing discussions among EU member states, including recognizing defense as a European public good and addressing unequal security burdens across the bloc. “There is a clear awakening in Europe regarding security,” said Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domański, who hosted the meeting. “Many countries have shifted their stance compared to a year or two ago, and there is a stronger willingness to increase spending.” He praised the solidarity of southern EU nations with their Eastern and Central European counterparts and said a majority of member states now support finding new financing mechanisms. Domański also stressed the urgency of reaching agreement on the commission’s proposed the Security Action For Europe (SAFE) instrument by May, and encouraged EU countries to request flexibility in fiscal rules by the end of April so that adjustments can be approved by July and enable higher defense spending.

https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-war-recruitment-soars-with-record-bonuses/33383051.html,"Russian recruitment for men to fight in Ukraine is soaring in many of the country's regions, with signing bonuses and other incentives reaching new records in some places. In Siberian regions like Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, local authorities have aggressively pushed contracts on potential volunteers, and signing bonuses in some places exceed average annual salaries, according to recruits and official advertising campaigns. Sergei, who asked that his real name not be used and that his specific town in the Irkutsk region not be disclosed, said that, when he showed up at a recruiting office, he was immediately shown into a room and handed a brochure with ""big, red figure"" on the front: 1.4 million rubles ($16,700). ""It's supposedly what they’re paying you to go die. Or kill. Depends how it turns out, I guess,"" he told RFE/RL's Siberia Realities. Russian officials have not released casualty figures since 2022, but Western estimates put the number of Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the all-out invasion in February 2022 at more than 790,000. The bulk of those casualties have occurred as a result of the battlefield tactics that Russian commanders have relied on: front infantry assaults, sometimes on foot, sometimes on motorcycles, that seek to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses. Extraordinarily High Wages And Benefits To replenish personnel, authorities have relied heavily on extraordinarily high wages and benefits to attract volunteers to fight in Ukraine. The signing bonuses typically are a mix of federal and local payments. Authorities in Moscow have also pressured regional leaders to meet quotas for new volunteers. In Iskitim, a town near the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, a woman who asked to be called Galina said she visited her local recruiting office on behalf of her nephew, who had previously been rejected for medical reasons. She said the recruiter pushed her to bring him to the enlistment office -- not just pass along the brochures to him. “I told her I’d think about it,” she said. “They’re taking everyone.” 'You Could Die In Your First Week' She said officials are offering 1.2 million ruble signing bonuses ($14,300), but they're also highlighting a monthly salary for fighting in the war: starting at 210,000 rubles ($2,500). ""Then they keep adding numbers, trying to make it sound as good as it did in late 2024,"" she said. ""Never mind that you could die in your first week."" Galina said there were two other men at the recruiting on the day she visited recently. One was seeking a ""missing-in-action"" certification for a relative, the other wanted a death certificate for his 24-year-old son, so he could claim death benefits, but he didn't have the proper proof.

The reality is that Nigeria is fighting multiple security threats, including banditry, terrorism, and organized crime, all of which affect different communities irrespective of religion.” The statement reaffirmed Nigeria’s commitment to upholding “freedom of religion and freedom of expression, among other freedoms,” and assured that “any reports of threats or intimidation against religious leaders will be investigated, and appropriate actions will be taken.” While acknowledging the concerns raised, the Ministry rejected “the portrayal of the crisis as an ‘Islamist extermination’ of Christians,” stating:”Government will continue to prioritize the protection of the lives and property of its citizens regardless of faith or ethnicity while strengthening national and international cooperation in the fight against insecurity. “We therefore call for responsible reporting that reflects the full complexity of the challenges at hand and promotes constructive dialogue rather than polarization.” Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/underestimating-china,"Success in great-power competition requires rigorous and unsentimental net assessment. Yet the American estimation of China has lurched from one extreme to the other. For decades, Americans registered blistering economic growth, dominance of international trade, and growing geopolitical ambition, and anticipated the day when China might overtake a strategically distracted and politically paralyzed United States; after the 2008 financial crisis, and then especially at the height of the COVID pandemic, many observers believed that day had come. But the pendulum swung to the other extreme only a few years later as China’s abandonment of “zero COVID” failed to restore growth. Beijing was beset by ominous demographics, once unthinkable youth unemployment, and deepening stagnation while the United States was strengthening alliances, boasting breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and other technologies, and enjoying a booming economy with record low unemployment and record high stock markets. A new consensus took hold: that an aging, slowing, and increasingly less nimble China would not overtake an ascendant United States. Washington shifted from pessimism to overconfidence. Yet just as past bouts of defeatism were misguided, so is today’s triumphalism, which risks dangerously underestimating both the latent and actual power of the only competitor in a century whose GDP has surpassed 70 percent of that of the United States. On critical metrics, China has already outmatched the United States. Economically, it boasts twice the manufacturing capacity. Technologically, it dominates everything from electric vehicles to fourth-generation nuclear reactors and now produces more active patents and top-cited scientific publications annually. Militarily, it features the world’s largest navy, bolstered by shipbuilding capacity 200 times as large as that of the United States; vastly greater missile stocks; and the world’s most advanced hypersonic capabilities—all results of the fastest military modernization in history. Even if China’s growth slows and its system falters, it will remain formidable strategically. During the Cold War, Soviet leaders often made the point that “quantity has a quality all its own.” As productivity equalizes, nations with larger populations, broader geographic reach, and greater economic heft scale up and dominate smaller first-movers. This dynamic has held throughout most of history. The United States benefited from it during the last century. It caught the tide of European industrialization, then leveraged its continental scale and larger population to outclass the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, and ultimately the Soviet Union. Today, it is China that benefits from that dynamic and the United States is at risk of being overtaken technologically, deindustrialized economically, and defeated militarily by a rival with far greater size and productive capacity. This is an era in which strategic advantage will once again accrue to those who can operate at scale. China possesses scale, and the United States does not—at least not by itself. Because its only viable path lies in coalition with others, Washington would be particularly unwise to go it alone in a complex global competition. By retreating to a sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere, the United States would cede the rest of the world to a globally engaged China. Yet acknowledging the need for allies and partners should be the starting point, not an endpoint—because the United States’ legacy approach to alliances will no longer suffice. That approach, rooted in Cold War–era assumptions and extended by inertia over eight decades, tended to view partners as dependents: recipients of protection rather than co-creators of power. They were often seen as helpful, but also as burdensome and even obstructive. That model is obsolete. To achieve scale, Washington must transform its alliance architecture from a collection of managed relationships to a platform for integrated and pooled capacity building across the military, economic, and technological domains. In practical terms, that might mean Japan and Korea help build American ships and Taiwan builds American semiconductor plants while the United States shares its best military technology with allies, and all come together to pool their markets behind a shared tariff or regulatory wall erected against China. This kind of coherent and interoperable bloc, with the United States at its core, would generate aggregate advantages that China cannot match alone. But such an approach demands a fundamental reorientation, from command-and-control diplomacy to a new capacity-centric statecraft. This radical shift in how the United States builds and wields power is essential in a world where it no longer has the singular advantage of scale. As China plays for time and mass, the United States and its partners must play for cohesion and collective leverage. To repurpose the warning often attributed to Benjamin Franklin: we must hang together, or we will all hang separately. Not every large country becomes a great power. Size refers to dimensions; scale is the ability to use size to generate efficiency and productivity and thereby outcompete rivals. Small states can become world-class by maximizing efficiency on a small foundation, but when large states run that playbook on a much larger foundation, they can remake the world. Broader internal markets can drive down costs, enabling companies to outcompete others around the world. Bigger populations create deeper pools of talent and research. Large states are less reliant on trade, which gives them greater resilience. And they can field larger militaries. Small states have risen to power on first-mover advantages, often with the acquiescence or benign neglect of larger states. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the United Kingdom was able to dominate the world with a first-mover advantage in industrialization. But that dominance was short-lived. Germany and the United States—thanks in part to the diffusion of British industrial methods—were able to achieve greater scale than a small island in the northwest corner of Europe. From 1870 to 1910, the British share of global manufacturing fell by half as the United States and Germany caught up and surpassed it. While the United Kingdom’s steel production doubled, to 6.5 million tons, Germany’s quintupled, to 12 million, and the United States’ grew sixfold, to 23 million. Germany and the United States pushed the British out of major industries, leveraging their larger internal markets, resource bases, and talent pools to drive down marginal costs. That economic advantage translated into still greater military and technological advantage. Together, these trends led to the United Kingdom’s gradual deindustrialization and eventual decline. British leaders and strategists were aware of the problem. In the late nineteenth century, the British historian John Robert Seeley, in one of the most influential books of the era, worried about the emergence of “highly organized states on a yet larger scale,” noting that as technology diffused, “Russia and the United States will surpass in power the states now called great as much as the great country-states of the sixteenth century surpassed Florence.” Even before the collapse of the British Empire, he feared that the United Kingdom would be reduced “to the level of a purely European Power” such as Spain. Seeley was not alone in calling for his country to pursue the kind of scale and efficiency gains an island could not generate on its own, through “Greater Britain”—tighter integration with imperial holdings in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. But these efforts were delayed, inconsistently pursued, and ultimately a failure. The colonies went their own way, and the British never found scale. When World War I broke out, London was fortunate to have a much more powerful ally in Washington—one with the scale to help win the war. That scale was clear to rivals. Before World War II, Hitler observed that “The American Union . . . has created a power factor of such dimensions that it threatens to overthrow all previous state power rankings.” Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto predicted that his country’s forces would “run wild for the first six months or a year, but I have utterly no confidence for the second and third years” because of the United States’ manufacturing advantage. Italy’s foreign minister also recognized that a protracted war favored the United States: “Who will have the most stamina? This is the way the question should be put.” All the Axis powers feared U.S. industrial capacity. They understood that quantity was a quality of its own. Today, that daunting scale and capacity belongs to China. American strategists must confront the risk that the United States could find itself in the position of the United Kingdom a century ago. The British experience offers both lessons and warnings: its effort at imperial integration was too little and too late. But the United States today can succeed where Britain failed, by harnessing allied and partner scale in new ways. The starting point for that success must be accurate self-assessment. In recent years, the pages of Foreign Affairs have featured a slew of essays making the case that the United States has a clear and enduring advantage over China. Michael Beckley argues that “the Chinese economy is shrinking relative to that of the United States” and that “current trends are solidifying a unipolar world.” Stephen Brooks and Ben Vagle claim that “the United States still has a commanding and durable advantage” that would give it significant economic leverage in a conflict. Jude Blanchette and Ryan Hass conclude that “the United States still has a vital edge over China in terms of economic dynamism, global influence, and technological innovation.” Predicting the rise or fall of great powers is always a fraught exercise, given inadequate information, the risks of bias, the long shadow of current events, and the challenge of sorting out which metrics matter most and in what time frame. American strategists previously swung from one extreme to another in their estimation of Japan and the Soviet Union. That same weakness has characterized net assessment of China and the United States. There is no question that China faces significant problems: an aging society, towering debt, stagnating productivity, growing risks in its housing market, high youth unemployment, crackdowns on the private sector. But even grave macroeconomic challenges do not neatly translate to strategic disadvantage. Two facts can be true at the same time: that China is slowing economically and that it is becoming more formidable strategically. And Beijing might well address economic challenges with a return to sound decision-making in the years ahead. Emphasizing China’s weaknesses risks understating its scale and capacity on the metrics and time frame most relevant for great-power competition. For example, the idea that the United States’ economy will remain larger than China’s—contrary to most expectations just a few years ago—is frequently offered as evidence of commanding U.S. advantage. But as the economist Noah Smith argues in his analysis of these GDP comparisons, “Americans should take little comfort in the fact that their total GDP at market exchange rates is outpacing China’s.” As exchange rates shift, so do comparisons of relative size, so that a 15 percent depreciation of the renminbi—as has occurred since its peak three years ago—would make the Chinese economy seem 15 percent smaller even if its output stayed the same. Accounting for purchasing power and local prices using the World Bank’s methodology, although imperfect, reveals instead that China’s economy surpassed the U.S. economy about a decade ago and is 25 percent larger today: roughly $30 trillion to the United States’ $24 trillion. This purchasing power adjustment captures the real cost of the determinants of national power, including infrastructure investment, weapons systems, manufactured goods, and government personnel—key factors in sustaining long-term strategic advantage. Using this approach, if one looks narrowly at goods rather than services, China’s productive capacity is three times as large as that of the United States—a decisive advantage in military and technological competition—and exceeds that of the next nine countries combined. In the two decades after China joined the World Trade Organization, its share of global manufacturing quintupled to 30 percent while the U.S. share halved to roughly 15 percent; the United Nations has estimated that, by 2030, the imbalance will grow to 45 percent and 11 percent. China leads in many traditional industries—producing 20 times as much cement, 13 times as much steel, three times as many cars, and twice as much power as the United States—and increasingly in advanced sectors as well. Although still catching up in fields such as biotechnology and aviation, which have been traditional U.S. strengths, China—thanks in part to ambitious industrial policy efforts such as Made in China 2025—produced almost half the world’s chemicals, half the world’s ships, more than two-thirds of electric vehicles, more than three-quarters of electric batteries, 80 percent of consumer drones, and 90 percent of solar panels and critical refined rare-earth minerals. And Beijing is taking steps to ensure its dominance continues and expands: China was responsible for half of all industrial robot installations worldwide (seven times as many as the United States), and it is a decade ahead of anyone else in commercializing fourth-generation nuclear technology, with plans to build over 100 reactors in 20 years. The last great power to so thoroughly dominate global production was the United States, from the 1870s to the 1940s. American observers tend to underestimate China’s ability to innovate, mistakenly assuming it simply copies and reproduces Western innovations. Like the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and the United States before it, China’s manufacturing strength creates a foundation for innovative advantage. State investment helps, too; it now rivals the United States’ investment in science. And China’s large population provides a deep talent pool and competitive scale. In ten industries of the future, according to a recent report from the Information Technology and Industry Foundation, China is near the leading edge of innovation (or better) in six. This industrial and innovative strength can be activated for military purposes. China’s navy, already the largest in the world, will add a staggering 65 vessels in just five years, reaching a total size 50 percent larger than the U.S. Navy—roughly 435 vessels to 300. It has rapidly increased its ships’ firepower, surging from one-tenth of the United States’ vertical launch system cells a decade ago to likely exceeding U.S. capacity by 2027. Although China lags the United States in aviation, it has broken a long-standing technical barrier by building jet engines at home and is now rapidly closing the production gap, with the ability to build more than 100 fourth-generation combat aircraft annually. In most missile technologies, China is probably the world’s leader: it boasts the first antiship ballistic missile, impressive air-to-air missile range, and the largest stockpile of conventional cruise and ballistic missiles. And in a growing number of military fields, from quantum communications to hypersonics, China is ahead of any competitor. These advantages, built over decades, will persist even if China stagnates. China’s challenges are significant. But their strategic importance is often overstated. For example, its demographic challenges will be a major issue in the long term, but in the medium term—a timeline much more relevant to competition with the United States—they are manageable. A generational “echo boom,” as the grandchildren of the Mao-era baby boomer generation enter the workforce, means that, despite an aging population, the percentage of the population below the age of 15 has actually increased, by over 30 million between the 2010 and 2020 censuses, and it has also grown as a percentage of the total population. China’s dependency ratio (of adult workers to children and retirees) will remain below Japan’s current ratio until 2050. And massive investments in education, industrial robotics, and embodied artificial intelligence will help China weather labor shortfalls. Debt levels are also illustrative. Although China’s household, corporate, and government debt is at a record 300 percent of GDP, other powers—including India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States—have similar levels of total debt. In some cases, metrics that indicate weakness in one area reflect strategic strengths in another. China’s housing bust, for example, is a drag on growth. But Beijing is plowing credit from that sector into industrial policy efforts that are boosting competitiveness. Similarly, while American firms continue to capture a higher share of profits and dominate rankings of market capitalization, Chinese firms are focused on different goals, often running losses to gain market share and put rivals out of business. Despite short-term challenges, China continues to play the long game. Even if its weaknesses prove more severe than projected, China will remain vastly more powerful than any past U.S. competitor on the metrics most relevant for competition. Washington may have overestimated past rivals, including Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union. But China is the first to outmatch the United States in size alone, as well as in several strategically relevant areas. Stagnant or not, Beijing will remain more formidable than any past challenger. Some analysts warn that American declinism is itself a risk, which could become “a self-fulfilling prophecy.” There is wisdom in that admonition; the rise and fall of great powers often begins with flawed self-diagnosis. But it is also the case, as the political scientist Samuel Huntington argued in these pages before the fall of the Soviet Union, that fretting about decline can just as often drive renewal. The greatest risk is not declinism; it is complacency, leading to a lack of strategic intention and a failure to catalyze collective action to rise to the China challenge. If anything, the United States—particularly in the era of President Donald Trump—risks overestimating unilateral power and underestimating China’s ability to counter it. For Washington, three realities must be central to any serious strategy for long-term competition. First, scale is essential. Second, China’s scale is unlike anything the United States has ever faced, and Beijing’s challenges will not fundamentally change that on any relevant timeline. And third, a new approach to alliances is the only viable way the United States can build sufficient scale of its own. Altogether, this means that Washington needs its allies and partners in ways that it did not in the past. They are not tripwires, distant protectorates, vassals, or markers of status, but providers of capacity needed to achieve great-power scale. For the first time since the end of World War II, the United States’ alliances are not about projecting power, but about preserving it. During the Cold War, the United States and its allies outclassed the Soviet Union. Today, a slightly expanded configuration would handily outclass China. Together, Australia, Canada, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the United States, and the European Union have a combined economy of $60 trillion to China’s $18 trillion, an amount more than three times as large as China’s at market exchange rates and still more than twice as large adjusting for purchasing power. It would account for roughly half of all global manufacturing (to China’s roughly one-third) and for far more active patents and top-cited journal articles than China does. It would account for $1.5 trillion in annual defense spending, roughly twice China’s. And it would displace China as the top trading partner of almost all states. (China is today the top trading partner of 120 states.) In raw terms, this alignment of democracies and market economies outscales China across nearly every dimension. Yet unless its power is coordinated, its advantages will remain largely theoretical. Accordingly, unlocking the potential of this coalition should be the central task of American statecraft in this century. And that cannot be done by simply doubling down on the traditional alliance playbook. The starting point for the United States can be long-standing bilateral alliances (such as those with Japan and South Korea) and multilateral alliances (such as NATO), along with newer partnerships (such as the AUKUS defense technology agreement with Australia and the United Kingdom) and less institutionalized groupings (such as the Quad, which also includes Australia, India, and Japan). But rather than simply celebrating these frameworks or expanding their membership, the task ahead is to deepen their function—to make them foundations for capacity-centric statecraft across multiple domains. These relationships have too often operated on the assumption that the United States provides security while others contribute political support or, at best, niche capabilities. It has been largely security-centric, too—focused on deterrence, access, and reassurance—while leaving economic coordination, industrial integration, and technological collaboration as emerging but still secondary concerns. The traditional model was simply not designed to compete with a systemic rival on the order of China. It is dangerously inadequate to the demands of the moment. The U.S. approach to alliances and partnerships in recent decades has been shaped by a combination of strategic habit and structural hierarchy. Now, it must become a platform for generating shared capacity across all critical domains—not just military ones. That will require a level of coordination and codependence that is unfamiliar and will at times be uncomfortable for both the United States and its partners. For military power, creating scale requires capacity to flow in both directions, including investment in the weaker parts of the U.S. defense industry and more generous provision of advanced U.S. military technologies to allies who historically have not received it. For the economy, scale means building a shared tariff and regulatory wall against China’s excess capacity while constructing new mechanisms to coordinate industrial policy and pool allied market share. For technology, the challenge will similarly be to erect common investment rules, export controls, and research protections to prevent technology transfer to China while undertaking joint investment. These steps mark the difference between a coalition that is aligned in principle and one that is fused in practice. That shift—toward shared capacity as the foundation of strategy—will allow the United States and its partners to compete at scale and at speed. The Biden administration used existing security alliances and partnerships to construct a “latticework” meant to better distribute force posture, increase allied defense spending, and launch new security arrangements such as AUKUS while elevating bodies such as the Quad. These efforts should be reinforced, but the next step is to transform defense-industrial cooperation. The lessons from Ukraine are clear: the United States would lack sufficient capacity to sustain a prolonged conflict with China on its own. Although innovation from new firms in uncrewed systems is promising, true scale, particularly in legacy systems, will require co-production and deeper industrial integration with allies. The World War II Arsenal of Democracy is unlikely to return. In its place, the United States needs to construct what the historian Arthur Herman has called an Arsenal of Democracies: a networked defense industrial base built on joint production, shared innovation, and integrated supply chains. This marks a sharp change from the past, when the United States primarily provided capability to others. Now, scale demands two-way flows, including allied investment and manufacturing in the United States. Some initial steps the Biden administration took, such as having the Japanese repair American destroyers, provide a modest glimpse of what is possible. More ambitious efforts might involve joint ventures with Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders (which are two to three times more productive than U.S. firms); partnerships between Europe’s missile manufacturers and U.S. companies; or recruiting Japanese or Taiwanese firms to build legacy microelectronics in the United States. Too often, dated regulatory and political constraints, which must be addressed jointly by Congress and the executive, create barriers to benefiting from allied capability. The United States’ own capability must also flow outward to allies. Biden-era efforts such as AUKUS and the co-production of Tomahawk missiles with Japan are steps in the right direction. But real progress requires overcoming a bureaucratic alliance between a State Department concerned about proliferation and a Defense Department fearful of eroding its edge. Sharing technology quickly is the key to ensuring that Australia builds nuclear submarines, that Asian allies have sufficient antiship cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, that Taiwan can deter Chinese invasion, and that India is able to turn the Andaman Islands to its east into a fortress that Beijing cannot ignore. In practice, this could mean harmonizing export-control laws, aligning procurement standards, and coordinating investment in chokepoint components, from semiconductors to optical equipment. Allies can also transfer capacity to each other, both within regions and between different ones. Some of this has begun to happen haltingly, but much more is possible. South Korean weapons can help Europe rearm and reindustrialize. French nuclear technology can support India’s submarine program. Norwegian and Swedish missiles can help Indonesia and Thailand defend their waters. Pooling capacity requires thinking across alliances, with the United States facilitating collective action. Tighter integration also requires more burden sharing—and burden shifting. Even as allies and partners build bridges across continents, they must also play a bigger role in deterrence closer to home, with Europeans stepping up in Europe and Asians stepping up in Asia. That can be done in part by strengthening the security dimension of increasingly important groupings (the Quad or the trilateral relationship with Japan and Korea). But Washington also needs to strengthen coordination with allies for actual warfighting—through steps such as modernized joint command-and-control systems, new investments in interoperability, and more sophisticated joint exercises. That could include creating joint units with U.S. allies and partners, starting with ground-based antiaircraft and antiship missile battalions to be used in a crisis in the Indo-Pacific and later extending to more complex air and naval air formations. The United States should also reinforce extended deterrence by offering allies a greater say in nuclear command and control and the kinds of nuclear sharing arrangements that it pursued with European allies during the Cold War. Globally, the United States could pursue a new version of U.S. President Richard Nixon’s “Guam Doctrine,” which devolved responsibilities to partners after the Vietnam War. That would empower regional states—what former Australian Prime Minister John Howard called “deputy sheriffs”—to take the lead on security challenges in their neighborhood: Australia in the Pacific islands, India in South Asia, Vietnam in continental Southeast Asia, Nigeria in Africa. In practical terms, the next time a South Asian country faces challenges, the United States would defer to India’s judgment on what might serve regional stability or counter China’s influence rather than seek to advance its own preferences. The Biden administration took important steps in the economic and technology competition with China, with initiatives such as the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, and coordinated semiconductor export controls with Japan and the Netherlands. But withstanding China’s excess capacity and retaining technological leadership will require more ambitious action, beyond what Washington has typically been willing to do. China’s nonmarket practices and sheer scale have overwhelmed the World Trade Organization and now pose an existential risk to the industrial base of the United States and its allies and partners. Attempting to act alone against this threat will mean failure: securing the U.S. market will do little good if China can still push U.S. companies out of partner markets, depriving them of the scale they need to remain competitive. Instead, the United States and its allies and partners must find scale together, through a defensive moat against Chinese exports. Building a protected common market could start with coordinated tariffs on Chinese goods. But because tariffs can be easy to circumvent, a better approach might be to use coordinated nontariff barriers, including regulatory tools. (The Biden administration used such barriers against digitally connected vehicles from China.) Such regulatory measures could be coordinated with partners relatively quickly and easily. Another tool is “preferential plurilateralism”—selectively opening allied and partner markets while creating higher barriers for Chinese goods. This approach, broadly supported by figures across the political spectrum, from Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative during Trump’s first term, to prominent Democratic legislators, echoes aspects of the early post–World War II trading system, which gave preferential treatment to members of the free world over autocratic rivals. If the era of free trade agreements is over for now, then sectoral agreements with allies could offer promising avenues for pooling markets while avoiding political sensitivities. Coordinated industrial policy instruments would also be useful, such as a new international industrial investment bank that would make loans to firms in strategic sectors to diversify supply chains out of China, especially in key sectors such as medicine and critical minerals. And coordinated efforts to remove barriers to allied and partner investment could, for example, allow the bypass of national security review. Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have invested heavily in industrial cooperation with the United States (over $300 billion during the Biden administration with continued growth under Trump). And despite a tendency to dismiss Europe as economically stagnant, it outproduces the United States in steel, cars, ships, and civil aircraft; claims a greater share of global manufacturing; and has a manufacturing workforce three times the size of that of the United States. Meanwhile, stronger connections between scientific ecosystems—with more cooperation and people-to-people ties, along with common research protections—will help ensure that U.S. allies and partners can match China’s scale. Pooled market share would also create strategic leverage. A collective framework for economic defense—what some have called an “economic Article 5,” drawing on NATO’s mutual defense clause—is a long-overdue response to China’s economic coercion. Such an agreement would trigger coordinated sanctions, export controls, or trade action if one of the group’s members encountered economic pressure from Beijing. It would also function as a platform for deterring military aggression. Trump has presented the United States’ partners with hard choices and outright threats. Many may understandably be loath to further tie themselves to Washington any time soon. Trust, built over generations, is easily squandered. Great powers often overestimate their influence over others. Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev did not believe his experiments in regional autonomy would result in the exit of Soviet republics from the Soviet Union.

https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-fm-ukrainian-membership-in-nato-should-not-be-off-the-agenda/,"Ukraine’s NATO membership must remain on the international agenda, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum on April 12, stressing that Kyiv’s integration is essential for long-term transatlantic security. “This is not just about Ukraine,” Sybiha said. “This is about transatlantic security. It’s about our contribution.” He emphasized that Ukraine currently fields 110 combat-ready brigades, describing them as a “realistic, true contribution to future security — and, by the way, the cheapest one.” Sybiha also criticized Russia for violating all 10 principles of the Helsinki Final Act and highlighted the problems within the UN. “This year, we mark 80 years of the UN Charter. Why do I mention this? Because it is important that international law should be law, not simply declarations or words,” he said. He added that the global system had proven “dysfunctional” and “unjust” in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “We need new enforcement tools. We need reforms. We need reforms in the UN and, by the way, in humanitarian law — in the Geneva Conventions. We must update them, not only for Ukraine but for other countries like Syria. Having such a bitter experience, we are ready to contribute.” Addressing the ongoing war, Sybiha reaffirmed Ukraine’s desire for peace but warned against the misuse of the term. “We want to end this war this year. But it is important not to manipulate,” he said. “How this war ends will determine the future security architecture of Europe — it depends on the future security of every family in Europe,” he said. “That is why achieving a long-term and clear peace is fundamentally important.” Sybiha also condemned Russia for escalating attacks on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s commitment to a full ceasefire. “Yesterday marked exactly one month since Ukraine unconditionally supported a full ceasefire,” he said. “Instead of this, Russia has only escalated its terror,” 	Sybiha said According to the foreign minister, Russian forces have launched nearly 70 missiles, more than 2,020 Shahed drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs over the past month — most of them targeting civilian areas. “This clearly shows the world who truly wants peace and who is committed to war,” he said.",Ukrainian FM: Kyiv's membership in NATO should not be off the table,Anna Fratsyvir,The Kyiv Independent,2025-04-12T13:30:46.000Z,2025-04-12T13:44:06.000Z,gemini-2.0-flash

The launch kicked off the NROL-192 mission for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which builds and operates the United States' fleet of spy satellites. NROL-192 continues a facelift of sorts for that fleet: It was the ninth launch in support of the NRO's ""proliferated architecture,"" a new network comprised of large numbers of small, cost-efficient satellites (rather than a relative handful of highly capable but expensive craft, which has been the historical norm for the NRO). ""Having hundreds of small satellites on orbit is invaluable to the NRO's mission,"" NRO Director Chris Scolese said in the proliferated architecture press kit, which you can find here. ""They will provide greater revisit rates, increased coverage, more timely delivery of information — and ultimately help us deliver more of what our customers need even faster,"" he added.

https://www.thetimes.com/uk/defence/article/russia-secret-war-uk-waters-submarines-dpbzphfx5,"Russian sensors suspected of attempting to spy on the UK’s nuclear submarines have been found hidden in the seas around Britain. The discovery by the British military was deemed a potential threat to national security and has never been made public. Several were found after they washed ashore, while others are understood to have been located by the Royal Navy. The devices are believed to have been planted by Moscow to try and gather intelligence on Britain’s four Vanguard submarines, which carry nuclear missiles. One of these submarines is always at sea under what is known as the UK’s continuous at-sea deterrent. The Sunday Times has chosen to withhold certain details, including the locations of the sensors. During a three-month investigation we spoke to more than a dozen former defence ministers, senior armed forces personnel and military experts to expose how Russia is using its unrivalled underwater warfare capabilities to map, hack and potentially sabotage critical British infrastructure. We were allowed unprecedented access to the RFA Proteus, the Royal Navy’s deep-sea surveillance vessel, to witness how it is leading efforts to counter threats in domestic waters. The investigation also found: Unmanned Russian vehicles have been discovered lurking next to deep-sea communications cables. The Ministry of Defence had credible intelligence that superyachts owned by Russian oligarchs may have been used to conduct underwater reconnaissance. The navy has discovered other sensors planted on the sea bed. The government is looking at requiring technology and energy companies to work more closely with the military and fund the protection of underwater infrastructure. Senior military figures liken the technological battle for supremacy below the waves to the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Now Britain has “woken up” to the Russian threat, the question is whether it is capable of catching up. First line of defence At 8.45am on March 21, a black inflatable speedboat is skimming across Campbeltown Loch towards one of the most secretive vessels in the Royal Navy’s fleet. The Sunday Times has joined senior naval officers being ferried to the RFA Proteus, named after the sea god in Greek mythology, as its crew spend the week training and experimenting with cutting-edge underwater vehicles. Anchored just off Scotland’s westernmost town, the Proteus forms an imposing silhouette against the Isle of Arran, its giant helipad and deep-sea crane clearly visible from a mile away. It is the first time a journalist has been allowed to observe its capabilities since the vessel came into service in 2023. On deck, helmeted crews prepare remotely operated vehicles that later today will be lowered to the sea bed via a moon pool — an opening in the hull the size of eight snooker tables. Other, more sensitive equipment is stowed in blue metal containers. Already aboard are two dozen members of the navy’s diving and mine-hunting squadrons, experts in searching out, recovering and destroying enemy munitions on the sea bed. They are here for the first time and will become an integral part of the ship’s operations, because Britain’s critical undersea infrastructure is under unprecedented threat from a long-standing nemesis: Russia. Cat and mouse When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the might of Russia’s non-nuclear forces went with it. But according to Royal Navy insiders, Moscow never stopped investing in the submarines patrolling the murky depths of the world’s oceans. Russia is the only nation with a fleet of specialist subs for sea-bed warfare and espionage. Some surpass the capabilities of those of Britain and its Nato allies. By the time President Putin sent tanks into Ukraine three years ago, Russia had already begun setting the stage for a much wider conflict with Nato, engaging in surveillance and sabotage of the underwater internet connections, energy pipelines and military cables that are vital to the functioning of western democracies. These activities are at the heart of Putin’s “greyzone” doctrine. The blowing up of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in 2022 was the first major incident; Royal Navy insiders maintain that its “military precision” had all the hallmarks of a Kremlin greyzone operation. In the past 15 months, at least 11 internet cables in the Baltic Sea have also been damaged, some from ships dragging anchor across the sea bed. Suspicion has come to rest on Russia’s shadow fleet of ageing tankers, which are mainly used by Putin to circumvent western oil sanctions. “You really need to keep the [engine] power on to drag, so it is a deliberate act,” a defence insider said. When a cable between Estonia and Finland was damaged in December, the Joint Expeditionary Force, a group of northern European and Baltic states led by the UK, responded by activating Nordic Warden, a reaction system that uses AI to track locations of the shadow fleet. A senior serving British military figure added: “There should be no doubt, there is a war raging in the Atlantic. This is a game of cat and mouse that has continued since the ending of the Cold War, and is now heating up again. We are seeing phenomenal amounts of Russian activity.” The Russian underwater research programme is largely overseen by the Main Directorate for Deep-Sea Research (Gugi). Its best-known vessel is the spy ship Yantar, which gained notoriety last year when it appeared off the British coast. It is equipped with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and two mini-submarines capable of reaching depths of 6,000m, craft that allow the Yantar to find and map infrastructure, as well as to cut cables using manipulator arms or tap them for information. In November, the Yantar was found in the Irish Sea loitering near cables carrying data for Microsoft and Google. The Proteus was one of several vessels dispatched to monitor it – or, as a defence source describes, it show Russia “they were pissing in our backyard.” When the Yantar returned to the English Channel in January, the defence secretary John Healey authorised HMS Somerset and HMS Tyne tracked it at closer range, while HMS Astute, a nuclear-powered submarine, covertly monitored the vessel from below before surfacing alongside it. This more aggressive posture has been widely welcomed in the navy, with a senior official stating: “We’ve got to play by the rules of the game. But whereas before we were playing it nicely, now we’re being more muscular.” However, the Yantar is not where the real problem lies. The waters immediately encircling Britain sit for the most part on the European continental shelf, meaning they are seldom deeper than 300m. The navy has several ways of monitoring them and is confident it can keep tabs on Russian activity. But where the continental shelf ends, the sea bed drops thousands of metres. The Proteus is the only navy surface vessel truly capable of policing these depths, where Gugi’s most potent threat, its fleet of six-nuclear powered mini-submarines, could be lurking. The mini-subs can sit on the sea bed and have manipulator arms capable of cutting cables, laying explosives or placing taps on fibreoptic cables for hacking purposes. They are supported by two larger “mother” submarines, meaning they can be moved covertly to pretty much anywhere in the world. Russia has other capabilities. Three senior defence sources have revealed that prior to the full invasion of Ukraine, there was credible intelligence that superyachts owned by oligarchs may have been used to conduct underwater reconnaissance around Britain. Several of these vessels have moon pools that can be used covertly to deploy and retrieve deep-sea reconnaissance and diving equipment. A former minister also recounted how, in 2018, HMS Albion, an amphibious assault ship, had been forced to leave port prematurely while moored in Limassol, Cyprus. The vessel had been docked for under 24 hours when a huge superyacht belonging to an oligarch pulled up alongside it. Suspecting that it was there covertly to surveil the Albion, the navy ship “moved on quite quickly.” Sea-bed warfare The Nord Stream attack highlighted the fragility of the UK’s energy supply, almost a fifth of which now comes from offshore wind farms. The electricity generated by these turbines is transported to the mainland through undersea cables. Oil and gas pipelines are also vital to Britain, particularly those ferrying gas from Norway. They could easily be severed were Russia to plant explosive devices, such as shaped charges or mines. “You cut those and you’ve lost that energy — and in the winter during high usage, that could be serious,” a senior military figure said. A second added that a co-ordinated attack could lead to a “failure of the national grid”. The 60 internet cables that connect Britain to the rest of the world are coated in plastic polyethylene and only a few inches thick. They are easily cut and most of their locations are recorded publicly. However, navy sources said the private companies operating them have laid so many that there is enough “redundancy” in the system to recover quickly from all but the most severe attacks. The ones that trouble the UK government most are used to transfer banking data across the Atlantic and are integral to the functioning of western financial markets. Satellite back-ups would not be able to handle the huge volume of information that flows through them every second of every day. The government started to worry about these vulnerabilities a decade ago, when George Osborne’s Treasury received a research paper from a young financier called Rishi Sunak, who had recently joined the Policy Exchange think tank. Secretive work was commissioned on how these cables could be better protected, but the answers were deemed to be in the “too-difficult category”, according to sources. Sunak’s paper would not be published until 2017, several years later. What troubles the military more profoundly is the ability of Russia to map, tap into or destroy military cables vital to its operations around the world. “There are cables that are not public,” said one senior source. “The Russians have the capability to cut military cables.” Before the visit to the Proteus, two senior UK sources told The Sunday Times that in around 2020, Russian UUVs — remotely operated and capable of operating at deep depths and travelling for hundreds of miles for days at a time — were found next to sensitive underwater cables. There was no mothership or submarine near by, suggesting they had travelled a great distance to reach the cables. The Ministry of Defence deemed it “beyond reasonable doubt” that the UUVs were attempting to hack the cables, although no evidence to date suggests Russia has succeeded. However, it has uncovered proof of other Russian activity that is altogether more disturbing. Hiding in plain sight In recent years, the navy has found a number of sensor devices in the seas around Britain. The Ministry of Defence believes they were planted there by Moscow in order to detect the movements of Britain’s four Vanguard submarines, which together make up the UK’s constant at-sea nuclear deterrent. After leaving Faslane in Scotland, the submarines “vanish” and are supposed to be invisible from enemy states for the entirety of their deployment, which is typically 90 days or more. It is not clear what type of sensors were found. Several had washed up on the shore, but more have been identified using the Royal Navy’s fleet of mine-hunter vessels. As they searched, the navy found other sensors it did not know were there, The Ministry of Defence said the at-sea deterrent remains “undetected.” Whether the UK has discovered evidence of other Russian activity is top secret. “It’s a bit like the space race,” said one senior UK source. “This is a world clouded in secrecy and subterfuge, it’s very hard to get absolute clarity. But there’s enough smoke to suggest something is on fire somewhere.” Catching up In 2021, the Integrated Review — a master document outlining the UK’s national security and foreign policy aims after Brexit — committed to purchasing a surveillance ship to protect the UK’s critical underwater infrastructure and to allow the authorities to better understand the scale of the threat. Two years later, the MoD bought a Norwegian deep-water offshore support vessel, the Topaz Tangaroa, for £70 million. It was modified and renamed the Proteus before becoming operational in October 2023. The ship has a permanent crew of about 30 civilian sailors from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the merchant arm of the navy, but is ultimately run by specialist naval teams. Life on the Proteus is demanding and the ship is expected to be at sea 330 days a year. A week before The Sunday Times visit, members of the navy’s mine-hunting and threat-exploitation teams had embedded for the first time. Among them was X-Ray Squadron, which uses autonomous underwater vehicles for mine-hunting, as well as identifying and destroying threats. During our visit, the teams were training with one of their newest assets: the SeaCat, a cutting-edge 3m-long, torpedo-shaped autonomous vehicle. It has a high-resolution camera on its nose and advanced sonar systems on its sides like wings. It is capable of running for 24 hours at depths of 300m and one of the commanding officers says it is typically between “three and six times quicker” at hunting mines than conventional methods. Nearby, another team is preparing the Gavia, a UUV that can plunge 1,000m, deep enough to cover most of the waters surrounding the UK. Then there is the Defender, which can be fitted with an array of equipment, including manipulator arms. Porton Down, the military’s top-secret research facility, has been developing arms capable of handling and planting shaped charges, a precision explosive that can be used to disable enemy mines. This capability was tested recently off the coast of Norway, where the Proteus was sent to coincide with a visit by John Healey, the defence secretary, who is negotiating a deal with Oslo to work more closely together to counter the Russian threat. All three vehicles also have sophisticated sonar systems to scan large areas of sea bed. If they find suspicious activity, they can be sent closer to capture high-resolution images. Captain Simon Pressdee, one of the senior officers on the visit, said: “Our role is to both defeat any threats to the UK as well as take it out of the greyzone. We do the latter by understanding who is involved and providing that evidence to avoid misunderstandings and make those who threaten the UK accountable for their actions.” The Proteus has other assets that are able to delve to the deepest part of the ocean, although these were hidden away on the visit. Future-proofing With the government committed to spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence by 2027, further investment in sea-bed warfare is coming. The strategic defence review, commissioned by Healey to plug the gaps in Britain’s armed forces, is expected to recommend sharper focus on underwater infrastructure. Ministers have already accelerated the roll-out of the navy’s first autonomous mine-hunting vessel, the Ariadne and are rolling out a cutting-edge unmanned submarine under a programme called Project Cetus. The purchase of another Proteus-style ship is also being discussed. “Our adversary has multiple points of action that they can be playing, and we’ve only got one ship that can deal with it,” one insider said. As part of the review, the navy has proposed a new programme, Atlantic Bastion, which will develop a new fleet of air, surface and submersible vehicles, as well as sensors, to police British waters and the wider north Atlantic. In the shorter term, a project codenamed Cabot will get these capabilities up and running in partnership with private industries that rely on underwater infrastructure. This is likely to mean companies are asked to help fund operations, sources said. A similar idea has been pushed for years by Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the former Tory transport secretary and defence minister. “If this is a national endeavour, it is perhaps time to consider legislating for a level of assured protections of our energy, water, subsea cables … by asking everyone to chip in to the costs,” she said. “A hypothecated tax paid into a defence fund, which can provide protections and deterrence from those who wish our economic security and way of life harm, must be the way.” An MoD spokesman said: “We are committed to enhancing the security of critical offshore infrastructure. Alongside our NATO and Joint Expeditionary Force allies, we are strengthening our response to ensure that Russian ships and aircraft cannot operate in secrecy near the UK or near NATO territory, harnessing new technologies like AI and coordinating patrols with our allies. And our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent continues to patrol the world’s oceans undetected as it has done for 56 years.” Privately, some in the navy think the UK needs to go further and restore its capability to lay sea mines, something it has not done since the end of the Cold War. The last stockpiles were dispensed with in 1992, due to the ethical concerns of successive governments and the belief they were redundant. However, Australia has recently pledged £500 million for sea mines, and the Russian threat has reopened the question in the minds of some personnel. Poland and the Baltic states recently announced plans to withdraw from a treaty banning anti-personnel mines. The navy is not considering this at present and no proposal has been put forward as part of the strategic defence review. But one official, speaking anonymously, said the UK may well need to be able to lay defensive fields around British waters to keep out enemy submarines. Sir Keir Starmer’s government has clearly realised the scale of the threat, with billions of pounds of extra defence spending putting Britain closer to a war footing.

https://www.dw.com/en/gabons-junta-chief-expected-to-win-election-as-polls-open/a-72226389,"Polling centers closed in Gabon on Saturday after a presidential election which junta chief Brice Oligui Nguema is widely expected to win. Oligui Nguema, who led a coup in August 2023 and a month later declared himself transitional president, had been leading in pre-election polls. He campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket. He has also emphasized the need to break from the dynasty of Omar Bongo Ondimba and his son and successor Ali Bongo, who together ruled Gabon for more than 50 years. In the run up to the election — the first to be held in the country since the coup — Oligui Nguema had predicted a ""historic victory."" ""I am very confident. May the best man win,"" he said as he cast his ballot alongside his wife Zita at a school in the center of the Gabonese capital Libreville. His main opponent, Alain Claude ""Bilie"" By Nze, who was prime minister before the coup, has cast himself as the candidate for a ""complete rupture"" with the country's past. He has accused Oligui Nguema, who led the Republican Guard under the Bongos, of continuing their legacy. After casting his ballot, Nze warned reporters of potential ""problems"" during the counting.  ""We'll see what it will bring,"" he added. Election monitors at the Citizens Observers Network (ROC) said they were denied access to several voting offices, but Oligui Nguema insisted the election had been ""transparent"" and ""peaceful."" Ballot counting started shortly after 6 pm (5 pm UTC) when most polling centers closed, although some remained open for voters who were still waiting to cast their ballot.  Around 920,000 Gabonese were eligible to vote. The interior ministry said turnout was 87.12%. Initial results are expected to be announced on Sunday. The winner will be handed a seven-year mandate that can be renewed once. It is the Sahel nation's first election since the 2023 coup ousted the Bongo dynasty from power.  The election in the former French colony of 2.3 million people comes amid high unemployment, regular power and water shortages and heavy government debt. The small West African country is resource-rich, with significant deposits of petroleum, manganese, and iron ore. Gabon 2025 election: An example for the Sahel nations?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/12/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1143,"Here is where things stand on Saturday, April 12: Fighting Russia’s defence ministry said air defence units destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones within a span of 30 minutes late on Friday. The ministry said that between 10-10:30pm local time (19:00-19:30 GMT), nine drones were destroyed over Russia’s Rostov region on Ukraine’s eastern border, and four in the Kursk region on Ukraine’s northern border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the site of a deadly Russian attack on his hometown of Kryvyi Rih, one week after a Russian missile strike killed 19 people, including nine children and teenagers. Ukrainian officials have in recent days sent Washington a list of targets it believes Russia has struck in violation of the energy infrastructure ceasefire that Kyiv and Moscow agreed to last month as part of efforts by the United States to reach a ceasefire. Military analysts believe Russia is preparing to launch a new military offensive in the coming weeks to ramp up pressure and strengthen the Kremlin’s hand in ceasefire negotiations.   President Zelenskyy said that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting at the Ukraine front line alongside Russian forces, and accused Moscow of dragging Beijing into its invasion of his country. “As of now, we have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia’s occupation forces,” Zelenskyy said. More than 100 Chinese citizens fighting for the Russian military against Ukraine are mercenaries who do not appear to have a direct link to China’s government, two US officials familiar with American intelligence and a former Western intelligence official told the Reuters news agency. Chinese military officers have, however, been in the theatre of war behind Russia’s lines with Beijing’s approval to draw tactical lessons from the war, officials told Reuters. Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was ready to purchase additional air defence systems, adding that he discussed it with US President Donald Trump. Ceasefire Talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Russia lasted more than four hours, with no concrete results disclosed. According to Russia’s Interfax news agency, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not rule out the possibility of another phone call between Putin and Trump following the discussions. Trump said in a post earlier on Truth Social: “Russia has to get moving. Too many people [are] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!” Russia has rejected a US-backed proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire and appears to be dragging its feet on a more limited truce in the Black Sea agreed last month, analysts said.   German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Friday, after presiding over a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group in Brussels alongside British Defence Secretary John Healey, that “ongoing aggression” from Russia meant “we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future”. If a ceasefire is not achieved by the end of this month, Trump could impose additional sanctions on Russia, the US news site Axios reported, citing an anonymous source. Ukraine could be partitioned like Berlin after World War II, President Trump’s envoy to Kyiv, General Keith Kellogg, appeared to suggest as Russia continues to hold out on accepting a truce. In an interview with The Times newspaper, Kellogg said the country could be split into zones of control, with British and French troops as part of a “reassurance force” in the west and Moscow’s forces in the east. Between them would be Ukrainian forces and a demilitarised zone. Military Aid European countries have promised to send billions of dollars in further funding to help Ukraine keep fighting Russia’s invasion. Ukraine’s allies pledged a record 21 billion euros ($23.9bn) of military aid for the country, with the United Kingdom Defence Secretary Healey warning that 2025 was “the critical year” for the war. Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said that his country is monitoring the world armaments market and sees opportunities for Ukraine’s backers to buy more weapons and ammunition. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was absent from the Ukraine donor’s forum that the US established and led for several years, although he spoke to the meeting via video.   Sanctions A former Russian government minister who violated UK sanctions by receiving financial support from family members was sentenced to more than three years in prison in England. Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, who was appointed governor of Sevastopol in Russian-annexed Crimea by Putin, became the first person convicted of violating the sanctions put in place after the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Estonia’s navy said it detained an oil tanker believed to belong to Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Gulf of Finland in order to check its papers. Regional security A reduction in the number of US soldiers in Eastern Europe would be seen as Washington moving another step closer to Moscow and a worrying sign for Europeans, according to analysts. The NBC news channel, quoting US and European sources, said this week that the US Department of Defense was looking at the withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Europe. President Putin announced billions in investments for the rearmament of his country’s navy. “In the next decade, 8.4 trillion roubles [around $97bn] are earmarked for the construction of new boats and ships for the navy,” Putin said at a meeting on navy development in Saint Petersburg, according to Russian news agencies. Putin said the navy would develop drone and robot technology, and he claimed that 49 warships of various classes have been built in Russian shipyards in the past five years, including nuclear submarines that can be equipped with new Zircon hypersonic missiles. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sharply criticised European Union politicians against the backdrop of a rapprochement between the Kremlin and the new US administration. Politicians such as acting German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, European Union top diplomat Kaja Kallas and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were not thinking of their voters, but had put the desire to punish Russia above the wellbeing of their own citizens, Lavrov said.","Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,143",Al Jazeera,Al Jazeera,2025-04-12T05:04:36Z,2025-04-12T05:04:37Z,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.securityweek.com/china-admitted-to-us-that-it-conducted-volt-typhoon-attacks-report/,"In a secret meeting between Chinese and US officials, the former confirmed conducting cyberattacks on US infrastructure. In a secret meeting that took place late last year between Chinese and American officials, the former confirmed that China had conducted cyberattacks against US infrastructure as part of the campaign known as Volt Typhoon, according to The Wall Street Journal. The meeting took place at a Geneva summit in December and involved members of the outgoing Biden administration. The US officials who were present were startled by China’s admission, people familiar with the matter told WSJ [paywalled article]. The remarks made at the meeting by Chinese officials were “indirect and somewhat ambiguous”, but the American delegation interpreted that the attacks tracked as Volt Typhoon were conducted in response to the US supporting Taiwan, WSJ reported. The conclusion of American officials after the meeting was that the cyberattacks were meant to scare the United States from getting involved in a potential conflict between China and Taiwan. The Volt Typhoon attacks, which were attributed to China immediately after their discovery, involved the use of zero-day vulnerabilities and other sophisticated techniques. The attacks were aimed at critical infrastructure and raised concerns that they could enable China to spy on the US and cause significant disruptions. The Volt Typhoon threat actors managed to gain access to systems in a wide range of sectors, including communications, manufacturing, utility, construction, government, IT, maritime, transportation, and energy. It came to light recently that the hackers managed to dwell in the US electric grid for 300 days in 2023. According to WSJ, the Salt Typhoon attacks aimed at several major American telecom firms, which had come to light in the months leading up to the December meeting in Geneva, were also mentioned during the meeting, but the focus was on the Volt Typhoon attacks.  The Salt Typhoon campaign resulted in the phone calls and text messages of senior officials getting compromised. Unlike the Volt Typhoon attacks, which the US sees as an unacceptable provocation, the Salt Typhoon campaign is similar to cyberespionage that the US itself conducts against its adversaries. In recent years both the US and China have stepped up their game in publicly accusing each other of conducting cyberattacks.

https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250411-fears-for-political-stability-as-joseph-kabila-plans-return-to-eastern-drc,"Kabila this week announced his intention to leave South Africa, where he has been exiled since December 2023, and address the deteriorating security situation in eastern DRC. His return comes amid accusations from President Felix Tshisekedi that Kabila supports the AFC/M23 rebels responsible for recent military advances, including capturing key cities Bukavu and Goma. “After six years of total silence and given the worsening security situation, I have resolved to return home without delay to help find a solution,” Kabila wrote on Tuesday. ""I have decided to begin with the eastern region, where there is danger at hand."" In recent months, Kabila has been unusually outspoken about the DRC conflict, breaking his usual silence since stepping down in 2019. In February, he authored an opinion piece in South Africa’s Sunday Times, arguing the “DRC crisis needs more than a military solution”. Political analyst Michael Tshibangu told RFI that Kabila’s recent activities signal his intent to become more politically involved. “It is clear that he is stepping up to play a more active political role. But he has not put all his cards on the table. In typical Kabila fashion, he has maintained an element of mystery as to what his real political objectives are,” Tshibangu said. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan arrives in DRC amid escalating eastern conflict Meeting regional leaders Kabila, who is currently writing a thesis at the University of Johannesburg and spending time in Namibia and Zimbabwe, has reportedly held meetings with regional and international figures involved in the conflict. “Kabila met with representatives from Rwanda, Uganda and regional countries. He is trying to position himself as a credible alternative to President Felix Tshisekedi who is not currently enjoying good relations with DRC’s neighbours,” said Fred Bauma, of the Ebuteli research institute. “However, he will really have to convince them of his good will and capacity to be part of the solution. But that's far from being a done deal.” Kabila has also reached out to Congolese opposition politicians exiled in Europe, holding meetings with opposition leaders Moise Katumbi and Claudel Lubaya in Addis Ababa last December. “He is attempting to restructure the political opposition in DRC and may well be positioning himself to take the lead role with the support of various parties,” said Bob Kabamba, political science lecturer at Liege University in Belgium. Tshibangu noted that Kabila's announcement to return comes at a politically sensitive time, as President Tshisekedi appears weakened amid military setbacks. DRC president suggests unity government to respond to the crisis
 in the east Vast territory Kabila did not specify exactly when or where he intends to arrive in eastern DRC, prompting speculation and caution from observers. “The east of DRC is such a vast territory and he did not say that he will go to the areas controlled by the AFC/M23 rebels,” said Tshibangu. Tshisekedi has accused Kabila of sponsoring the AFC/M23 rebels, led by Corneille Nangaa, former president of DRC’s independent national electoral commission and an ally of Kabila. Kabila strongly denies these accusations and has publicly challenged Tshisekedi to provide evidence. “This could explain why he prefers not to go to Kinshasa, the capital city, first. Unless the government gives him assurances that he will not be arrested,” Tshibangu said.",Fears for political stability as Joseph Kabila plans return to DRC,Zeenat Hansrod,RFI,2025-04-11T14:57:47,2025-04-16T08:18:35,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2025/04/11/the-clock-is-ticking-for-iran-00287080,"With help from Nahal Toosi, Daniel Lippman and Phelim Kine Subscribe here | Email Robbie | Email Eric President DONALD TRUMP set a 60-day deadline for Iran to make progress on talks over its nuclear program or face potential military retaliation, according to four people familiar with the matter. The deadline, set out in Trump’s letter to Iran’s leader, sets the stakes for a high-profile meeting between the president’s top Middle East envoy, STEVE WITKOFF, and Iran’s foreign minister, ABBAS ARAGHCHI, in Oman on Saturday. It’ll be the first significant talks between Washington and its arch Middle Eastern rival since Trump took office. But some Israeli officials and GOP Iran hawks in Congress privately fear that these negotiations could play into Tehran’s favor, though few will openly criticize the president’s diplomatic efforts. That’s according to one current and one former Israeli official, as well as two GOP congressional aides and a former senior U.S. official familiar with the matter. We granted some of them anonymity as they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about sensitive diplomatic negotiations. They fear both Iran using the talks as a delaying tactic to rebuild its forces — or the prospect of Trump agreeing to a bad deal for the sake of clinching a quick diplomatic win. At the moment, Iran is reeling from Israel’s onslaught against its main proxy militant groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, and direct Israeli attacks on Iran’s military facilities late last year. From Iran’s perspective, “this is about intentionally wasting time it will use to advance its nuclear program and get in better standing with the international community,” said JONATHAN PANIKOFF, a former career senior U.S. intelligence officer who is now a Middle East security analyst at the Atlantic Council. “If this negotiation goes on and on, … what will we do? We have a window of opportunity that Iran is weak,” said JACOB NAGEL, a former head of Israel’s National Security Council now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. Nagel said he feared Trump would agree to a quick deal, even if it’s bad, for the optics. “Another check mark in his Nobel prize list and he will go to the next problem in the world,” Nagel said. Iran is reportedly open to an interim agreement on its nuclear program before pursuing talks on a more comprehensive agreement, as Axios reports today. Witkoff, in a newly published interview with The Wall Street Journal, signaled he was going into the talks open to allowing Iran to continue its nuclear program — so long as Tehran doesn’t weaponize it. “Where our red line will be, there can’t be weaponization of your nuclear capability,” he said. DAN SHAPIRO, a former senior Pentagon official and ambassador to Israel, said Iran could retaliate if the U.S. or Israel takes military action. “They have cards, and they’re playing them to try to steer the negotiations toward an outcome that they can live with,” said Shapiro. A spokesperson for Witkoff declined to comment. The National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment. Still, the 60-day deadline (which Trump outlined in his letter sent last month to Iran, according to four people familiar with the matter) could pressure Iran to move on a good deal. We also wanted to know, amid all this anxiety, what a good deal could possibly look like, particularly from Israel’s perspective. AMOS YADLIN, a former head of Israeli intelligence, told us: “It must include no sunset clauses, deal with the military dimension of the program, include much better inspections, include Iran entering into a 123 agreement and limit Iranian ballistic missiles — this is the minimum I think that will be considered as a deal that Israel could accept.” The Inbox WITKOFF’S OTHER MISSION: Before Witkoff heads to Oman for talks with Iran, he stopped in Moscow today and met with Russian leader VLADIMIR PUTIN. The meeting was the third between Trump’s envoy and Putin at the Kremlin as Washington pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump appears to be losing patience with Moscow, posting on Truth Social that “Russia has to get moving. Too many people are DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war.” LIBYA’S MAGA CHARM OFFENSIVE: ABDELKARIM MGEG, a Libyan nuclear scientist-turned-politician, this week courted top Republican politicians during a visit to Washington as he tries to become the United Nations-backed pick to be the next prime minister of the conflict-racked North African country, our Daniel Lippman writes in. In the last few days, he met with staffers of Senate Foreign Relations Chair JIM RISCH (R-Idaho) and Sens. JONI ERNST (R-Iowa) and KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-N.Y.), he said in a brief interview. And at the National Republican Congressional Committee president’s dinner Tuesday at the National Building Museum, he chatted with Speaker MIKE JOHNSON and former House Foreign Affairs Chair MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-Texas). Mgeg tailored his conversations to the MAGA vibes of Washington, making pitches on how the United States could help “make Libya great” and Libya could work together on getting more private investment into the country, as well as cooperate on security, energy and immigration. It’s an atypical strategy for getting Washington’s blessing. But Mgeg’s efforts come as Libya struggles to maintain political stability. The country is presently split in two, with separate governments in the west and east dueling for control of the whole country, with both sides courting more foreign engagement for international legitimacy. NEW ENEMIES OF MY ENEMY? China is increasing its outreach to countries hit hardest by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, in a sign that China may try to exploit the White House’s trade diatribes and peel away U.S. allies and partners. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson LIN JIAN also said that Chinese leader XI JINPING is going to Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia soon, on a conveniently timed trip that could help Beijing shore up its ties with some of Washington’s growing partners in the region. The U.S. has worked to deepen ties with Vietnam in recent years, and Malaysia and the U.S. have historically enjoyed a close diplomatic and security relationship. And China’s not just looking at its own neighborhood. Spanish Prime Minister PEDRO SÁNCHEZ was in Beijing today and met with Xi. That visit comes as China floats the idea of deeper European and Chinese trade partnerships to respond to Trump’s tariffs, as our colleague Aitor Hernández-Morales reports. That’s not the only trolling they’re doing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson MAO NING posted an image on X of a “Make America Great Again” hat with a “Made in China” sticker attached to it — and a pricetag increase of $50 to $77, a not-so-subtle reminder to the president that tariffs may increase prices on all goods manufactured in China.

Today, we’re featuring our new colleague Felicia Schwartz, who joined POLITICO this week from the Financial Times as our diplomatic correspondent and graciously stepped in to co-host today’s edition of your favorite newsletter. We had to ask how Felicia imbibes so that we could buy her a round of drinks for her troubles today. Felicia told us that her go-to drink is a Casamigos soda with a splash of lime juice, though she admits she’ll settle “for any blanco tequila whether I am roaming the embassies of D.C. or on the road following senior U.S. officials.” And it’s a tried and true drink for her, stretching from her adventures covering the U.N. General Assembly every year and her time based in Tel Aviv as a foreign correspondent. “I’ve found that simple, sugar-free cocktails are the secret to news gathering, or enjoyment, in the evenings, and then going back to work the next day without feeling completely dreadful,” Felicia says. Good advice for us all. Cheers, Felicia! IT’S FRIDAY! WELCOME TO THE WEEKEND: Thanks for tuning in to NatSec Daily!

His public debut is stirring more worries, based on keeping religion out of official day-to-day government work. In remarks this week to newly minted diplomats, Olowski referred numerous times to religion and God, according to a transcript obtained by our own Nahal Toosi. “To an officer of the United States like you and me, the Constitution is our commandment,” he said. “Its words are like the word of God and the words of the oath are our creation as officers. And these words are our beginning. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Olowski was clear, early in the remarks, that America protected the freedoms of nonbelievers as well as people of faith, saying the country’s commitment to religious liberty is “total.” But the text of his remarks has been circulating among diplomats, several of whom said they were uncomfortable with what they felt were overly religious overtones. NatSec Daily shared the transcript with spokespersons for the State Department as well as Olowski himself and asked for comment, but they did not reply. That’s not the only more explicit nod toward Christianity in Foggy Bottom. The State Department is telling staffers to report instances of “anti-Christian bias” within the workforce, part of an effort to implement a Trump administration executive order, according to a copy of a cable obtained by Robbie and Nahal. ANOTHER U.S. BROADCASTER BUCKLES: Middle East Broadcasting Networks Inc. will impose mass layoffs next week unless the Trump administration restores funding to the government-funded broadcaster. MBN was seen as a crucial tool to push back against propaganda in the Middle East put forward by U.S. adversaries like Iran and Russia. Those terminations follow ELON MUSK’s Department of Government Efficiency imposing a 30-day freeze on funding to MBN and other outlets supported by the Agency for Global Media, including Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty last month. The MBN terminations are a tactical move to allow the broadcaster time for legal challenges, MBN’s President JEFFREY GEDMIN told NatSec Daily. Keystrokes GROK GETS PROBED: Ireland is investigating whether Musk’s AI platform Grok was built using personal data from the X accounts of European citizens, our colleague Ellen O’Regan reports. In a statement, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission said it’d be investigating whether personal data “in publicly-accessible posts” on X was processed to train Grok, which could potentially violate the European Union’s data and transparency laws. The move, however, could stoke further tensions between Brussels and Washington, given Musk’s close relationship with Trump. The Complex GET YOUR ABACUS OUT: Defense budget watchers are scratching their heads at how the Trump administration will get towards its stated goal of a trillion dollar defense budget, our friends at Morning Defense reported this morning (for Pros!). Part of the confusion, per TODD HARRISON, an expert on defense budgeting who works at the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington, is that the administration has not specified whether Trump meant DOD (budget function 051) or broader national defense (050), which includes Energy Department nuclear programs. ICED OUT: The U.S. military just wished “farvel” to its top military in Greenland, our colleague Elena Giordano reports. Col. SUSANNAH MEYERS, commander of the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, was removed from her post after voicing dissent with Vice President JD VANCE’s visit to the Danish territory and support for U.S. annexation of the Arctic region. “I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the U.S. administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base,” Meyers wrote in an email to the base. Pentagon spokesperson SEAN PARNELL said Meyers was removed as “actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump’s agenda will not be tolerated.” Transitions — The Senate confirmed retired Lt.

https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-responding-helicopter-hudson-river/16153664/,"JERSEY CITY, New Jersey (WABC) -- Six people were killed after a tourist helicopter carrying a family from Spain crashed into New York City's Hudson River on Thursday afternoon. The crash was reported at 3:17 p.m. on the Jersey City side of the Hudson. Agustin Escobar, a Siemens executive from Barcelona, Spain, his wife Merce Camprubi Montal, and their children, ages 4, 5, and 11, were killed in the crash, law enforcement sources told ABC News. The pilot, who was 36, was also killed, making a total six people. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the helicopter was operated by New York Helicopters. The FAA believes the helicopter is a Bell 206 and appears to have taken off from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport at 2:59 p.m. It went up to the George Washington Bridge before turning back south along the Jersey side of the river. It went off radar at 3:25 p.m. Video shared with Eyewitness News appeared to show pieces of the helicopter break apart and crash into the water. Officials say the helicopter hit the water inverted, without a tail rotor or a main rotor blade. For witnesses, it turned out to be a memory full of horror. ""I watched it fall out of the sky! I heard five or six loud noises that sounded almost like gunshots in the sky and saw pieces fall off, then watched it fall into the river,"" said Dani Horbiak, who saw the crash from her apartment window. ""It sounded like a sonic boom on my right and so I look up and literally I see a helicopter splitting in two with the rotor flying off and this guy was going straight into the water and nothing came up afterwards,"" said a witness named Max. Officials say the entire flight lasted all of 15 minutes, before witnesses say it took an upside-down nosedive. ""It just kind of fell apart and it was the most terrifying thing that we ever witnessed,"" Rajany said. ""I heard some crackling, looked up and then just saw a plane falling apart,"" said witness Bruce Wall. ""And then maybe 15 feet in the air after the tail came off, broke off, and then the plane just sort of tumbled into the water with the propeller still in the air."" FDNY and NYPD divers were in the water almost immediately and assisted in the recovery. Four of the victims were declared dead at the scene and two victims were sent to local hospitals where they were pronounced dead. Jersey City Medical Center, where the passengers were transported after the crash, tried as hard as they could, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said. ""Our hearts go out to the family and those on board,"" Mayor Eric Adams said. A crane vessel hoisted the crumpled wreckage of the helicopter out of the Hudson and onto a barge Thursday night. Fulop said the main body of the aircraft has been recovered and is in the Army Corps of Engineers facility on Chapel Avenue, however major parts of the aircraft have still not been recovered. He says dive operations by the NYPD and NJSP will resume Friday morning. Police fished out chunks of jagged metal that washed up to the Jersey City shore, along with a life preserver, a seat and the personal effects of a family of five. The Spanish Consulate of New York City is now in touch with authorities to gather and confirm information and identification of the people involved in the helicopter crash, according to the communications team at the Spanish Foreign Ministry. The Jersey City Police Department is taking the lead on the investigation since the helicopter crashed on the Jersey City side of the river, Fulop said. Fulop said tours in the area are constant and fall within a busy and heavily trafficked area. He hopes this will increase the dialogue to decrease traffic. ""Hopefully this brings some more attention to it, that the fact beyond just noise, you have real safety concerns,"" Fulop said. The FAA says they are temporarily halting all operations around the Hudson River crash site. The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate the crash, and is expected to arrive on Thursday night. They will have to piece together what went wrong, and what caused the rotors to break apart, dooming the 21-year-old helicopter and the six people aboard. At least 32 people have died in helicopter crashes in NYC since 1977 -- most recently in 2019 when a helicopter used for executive travel hit the roof of Manhattan skyscraper in restricted airspace and the pilot was killed. ---------- *Get Eyewitness News Delivered *Follow us on YouTube *More local news *Send us a news tip *Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

https://www.ilmessaggero.it/en/pope_francis_uncertain_path_to_recovery-8761087.html?refresh_ce,"VATICAN CITY Uncertainty, caution, disorientation. At Santa Marta, they are truly navigating by sight. The pleasant ""surprise"" that Pope Francis wanted to offer for tomorrow's Angelus at noon, showing himself in front of the cameras for a few minutes—from inside Santa Marta—will have to wait for a more favorable time. When will that be? Who knows. In the Vatican, they shrug their shoulders despondently. From the airtight isolation on the second floor of the Domus where Bergoglio lives, hardly anything emerges, though many, knowing the stubbornness and unpredictability of this pontiff, do not even exclude that tomorrow morning, perhaps feeling a bit better than today, he might try again to record the brief message of thanks that he declined. This afternoon, Vatican technicians arrived at Santa Marta with all the equipment, awaiting instructions. They waited a bit and were eventually sent back. Francis didn't feel up to it. Nothing particularly concerning, and perhaps it's even normal for a patient with such a clinical picture to have moments of reconsideration, weakness, or temporary apathy, followed by alternating better phases. Yesterday, the Vatican staff had announced that Sunday's appointment would finally be different and would break the heavy media silence that has been ongoing for months. Naturally, no particular details were added, although it was clear that the Pope could now perfectly record a short video to circulate at noon. A second hypothesis was even seriously considered, that he might appear live in front of the cameras for a few minutes, just enough time to bless and thank the faithful worldwide for the devotion shown during his illness. Tomorrow, the Angelus for the eighth consecutive Sunday should only be in written form. It is also expected that at the end of the Mass in St. Peter's Square for the Jubilee of the Sick, Monsignor Rino Fisichella will read a brief papal message to the faithful. Bergoglio wants to express gratitude to millions of people who send a thought, a prayer, a message, a letter, or a drawing to the Vatican every day. Since the health risks for the pontiff are still quite high at this stage of convalescence, every decision is evaluated by the attending physicians and healthcare workers who, in agreement with the illustrious patient, help orient towards the best solution. The ""protected convalescence"" path—as it was called by the hospital team—requires several weeks of care and caution, and the slightest misstep can be dangerous, even excessive strain on the vocal cords already stressed during the long hospital stay for high-flow oxygen administration. Any uncalculated risk can turn back the clock. Consequently, everything is measured with common sense. Probably, Pope Francis is chomping at the bit; the isolation period is heavy, and he desires to soon resume some activities, for example, communicating with people again as he did before, even through indirect communication methods. In the Vatican, they assure that the improvements towards recovery are real, visible, and noticeable daily, thanks to motor and respiratory therapies, but bilateral pneumonia is not yet healed, the foci persist, and antibiotic treatments are still ongoing. To date, it's difficult to imagine if and when Pope Francis will be able to do the same things as before, such as intense and tiring trips, long celebrations, or the deadly concentration of daily appointments on the agenda. For this month, the meeting of the Council of Cardinals (the fifty-first) has been canceled: it was announced at the beginning of last December for April 2025 and would have been used to discuss the Synod and synodality. Meanwhile, Pope Francis from the Gemelli Polyclinic last month arranged that in 2028 he wants to convene a worldwide Ecclesial Assembly instead of the ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops. An attentive observer like Luis Badilla, former director of the para-Vatican site Sismografo, wonders if ""four months ago there was or wasn't this project? Or was it only thought of in these last three months? Above all, I wonder why the communication was made while the Pope was hospitalized and, finally, why nothing was anticipated to the members of the Council of Cardinals?""",Pope Francis' Uncertain Path to Recovery,Franca Giansoldati,Il Messaggero,2025-04-05T19:10:15,2025-04-06T22:30:28,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/eu-goes-hunting-for-central-asias-mineral-riches-at-samarkand-summit/,"SAMARKAND, UZBEKISTAN – With access to rare metals and critical minerals on their minds, a number of top EU leaders are travelling to Samarkand to meet with Central Asian presidents in a glittering palace on the outskirts of this ancient crossroads city. Central Asian leaders invited the European Union with a mix of enthusiasm and caution to gather on Thursday and Friday in Samarkand, situated along the historic Silk Road trade routes which now serves as Uzbekistan's host city for major diplomatic meetings The aim is to “significantly strengthen ties”, said the EU's ambassador to Uzbekistan, Toivo Klaar. Among the few announcements expected at the summit itself is the the creation of a European Investment Bank office in Tashkent, and plans for a European investment forum to be held in Uzbekistan before the end of the year. A “Samarkand declaration” that will reflect “the common aspiration of the parties to establish a strategic partnership” is also expected at the summit. Talks will touch on issues including connectivity, the environment and security as this year's EU focus considerably shifts to critical minerals. In this part of Eurasia, which has long been seen as a backwater by many in the EU, has seen a renewed interest from the West since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which upended long-standing economic relations and led Europeans to reconsider their geopolitical position. The landlocked former Soviet republics in Central Asia – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – are strategically significant, with governments still close with Moscow and much courted by Beijing. Russian firms have used the region as a base for efforts to circumvent Western economic sanctions. Europeans are seeking to strengthen their influence with Central Asian governments for this reason. But efforts to secure supplies of important minerals, and Europe's urgent need to diversify energy supplies, are also key motivations. Rare-earth diggers In addition to large uranium reserves, Central Asian countries have vast deposits of rare earths and new minerals such as lithium, as well as a host of other resources that are essential for the energy transition and new technologies. This is what Brussels is actively seeking, as the EU currently depends almost entirely on China for supplies of those resources. In March, the European Commission unveiled a plan to revive mining, including projects in third countries, less than a year after EU legislation aimed at securing the supply of critical raw materials came into force. ""We see the EU is very interested in Central Asia,"" said Han Ilhan, a consultant and board advisor to the Uzbekistan Technological Metals Complex. ""Many projects are being discussed right now.” Central Asia could become something like the El Dorado of European dreams. The 34 critical raw materials identified as needed by the EU – including cobalt, copper, tungsten, lithium and nickel – are present in large quantities in the Central Asian subsoil. “It's a little-known region, yet all the Central Asian countries are among the top 10 richest in terms of ores and rare earths, varying by type of material, with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan ahead of the pack,” said Roman Vakulchuk, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. “The investment climate is not very favourable, so we are not yet seeing a rush of Western rare metals western mining companies into Central Asia. But it won't be long,” said a French diplomat in Kazakhstan. The diplomat pointed in part to the absence of international standards in the mining sector in Central Asian countries. That hasn't stopped some European firms from plunging into the region. Germany's HMS Bergbau AG is implementing a joint project to exploit lithium deposits in eastern Kazakhstan. In November, Astana and Paris signed a roadmap for a strategic partnership in the field of critical resources and materials that runs through 2026. The deal should enable French companies to penetrate the Kazakh geological market as early as this year. At the EU level, Commissioner for External Partnerships Joseph Síkela signed a €3 million partnership agreement with Kazakhstan on critical raw materials and rare earths on March 13. Last May, Uzbekistan signed a memorandum of understanding with the EU for the same sector. Late to the game? The EU may have arrived late to Central Asia. China has been interested in its neighbours' underground resources for over a decade, and Chinese fims already hold most of the licenses and mining sites in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The majority of critical mineral exports from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are currently reserved for Beijing. Russia, for its part, has for decades largely secured its uranium needs from the region, which the Kremlin regards as its strategic ""near abroad"". The region is also economically dependent on Moscow for many infrastructure projects. On the other hand, the rush for critical metals in Central Asia has not gone unnoticed by other newcomers such as the United States, Canada and South Korea, all of which have recently signed major deals with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. ""Despite its fine words, the European Union is only involved in two or three projects in Central Asia.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/top-news/modi-leaves-for-thailand-sri-lanka-says-visit-to-bolster-ties-benefit-region-101743646746990.html,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday left for a four-day visit to Thailand and Sri Lanka to participate in the Bimstec Summit in Bangkok and to bolster relations with the two countries. Modi departed hours after US President Donald Trump slapped what he said were 26% “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on Indian exports to the US, and a formal Indian response is expected from the commerce ministry, people familiar with the matter said. TheThailandleg of the visit will be watched closely for a possible encounter or meeting between Modi andBangladeshinterim government chief Muhammad Yunus. People familiar with planning for the trip had earlier said a formal meeting is unlikely, but the Bangladesh side has made a strong push for a meeting over the past few days. In a statement ahead of his departure, Modi said he expected the visits to build on foundations of the past and contribute to strengthening India’s close relationships for the benefit of the wider region. He said he was travelling to Thailand at the invitation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to attend the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) Summit. Over the past decade, Bimstec has emerged as a “significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region”, he said. Noting that India’s northeastern region lies at the heart of Bimstec, Modi said he would meet leaders of the grouping and engage “productively to further strengthen our collaboration”. Since India stymied the activities of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) by pulling out of a summit to be hosted by Pakistan in 2016, it has focused on Bimstec – which includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand – as a platform for driving regional cooperation. A maritime cooperation agreement is expected to be signed during the Bimstec Summit in Bangkok on April 4. Modi will also have bilateral meetings with Shinawatra and the Thai leadership to bolster relations between the two countries. He will hold talks with Shinawatra on Thursday evening before participating in a dinner hosted by the Thai premier for the Bimstec leaders. Following the summit on Friday, Modi will meet Thai King Vajiralongkorn. Modi will travel from Thailand to Sri Lanka on Friday evening. This trip follows the visit of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to India last December. “We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of ‘Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future’ and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,” Modi said. The people said India and Sri Lanka are expected to sign up to 10 agreements during the visit, including a crucial pact to refresh defence cooperation for the first time since the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) intervention during the island nation’s civil war in the late 1980s.","Modi leaves for Thailand, Sri Lanka, says visit to bolster ties, benefit region",Rezaul H Laskar,Hindustan Times,2025-04-03T07:54:47,2025-04-03T07:54:47,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.europeafrica.army.mil/ArticleViewPressRelease/Article/4139490/press-release-three-us-soldiers-found-deceased-after-m88a2-hercules-recovered/,"WIESBADEN, Germany  — Three U.S. Army Soldiers assigned to 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division	were found deceased in Lithuania today, March 31. The Soldiers, whose identities are being withheld pending notification of next of kin, went missing in the early morning hours of March 25 in their M88A2 Hercules armored recovery vehicle while conducting a mission to repair and tow an immobilized tactical vehicle. Search and recovery operations continue for the remaining fourth Soldier. U.S. Army units supported by Lithuanian Armed Forces and law enforcement conducted a search in the area and found the Soldiers’ vehicle submerged in a body of water in the early hours of March 26. The M88A2 was removed from the peat bog early Monday morning, March 31, after a six-day-long effort that required tremendous resources from Lithuania, our steadfast Ally, and hundreds of service members from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, Lithuanian Armed Forces and the Polish Armed Forces—along with other elements from the Lithuanian government and civilian agencies—to solve the engineering challenge of recovering the 63-ton-vehicle from an area surrounded by unstable ground conditions. “The Soldiers we have lost in this tragedy were not just Soldiers - they were a part of our family. Our hearts are heavy with a sorrow that echoes across the whole Marne Division, both forward and at home,” said Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie, 3rd Inf. Div. commanding general. “We stand in grief with the families and loved ones of these extraordinary ‘Dogface Soldiers’ during this unimaginable time. But the search isn’t finished until everyone is home. Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.” Lithuanian armed forces provided military helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, unmanned aerial systems, and search and rescue personnel immediately to join the effort, and over the sequence of days brought in excavators, sluice and slurry pumps, other heavy construction equipment, technical experts, and several hundred tons of gravel and earth to enable the recovery. “Today is a very sad and tragic day. The loss of these Soldiers weighs heavy on me, the hearts of all Task Force Iron service members, and the 3rd Infantry Division. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of these brave Soldiers,” said Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor, commander of Task Force Iron and the 1st Armored Division. “I'd like to personally commend the heroic efforts of the search parties, and especially our Lithuanian allies who were instrumental in the recovery efforts. Their courage and commitment to this operation will always be remembered and demonstrates the strong relationship between our countries. However, search and recovery efforts are not complete - they will continue until we bring all of our Soldiers home.” U.S. Navy divers assigned to Commander, Task Force 68 assisted the recovery team with finding and accessing two hoist points Sunday evening. They maneuvered through thick layers of mud, clay, and sediment with zero visibility to reach the vehicle and hook steel cables that were attached to two M88A2 Hercules. Partway through the extraction the M88A2s began to lose traction, so several dozers were attached to provide additional grip. It took approximately two hours of winching to remove the M88A2 from the bog. The dive team has since transitioned to gridding out the area to enable a systematic search and the team is using a ground penetrating radar provided by Lithuanian experts to assist in the ongoing recovery operations. U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania Kara C. McDonald joined U.S. Army Europe and Africa Commander Gen. Christopher Donahue to observe ongoing recovery efforts today near Pabradė. The Soldiers were deployed to Lithuania in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve, and were permanently stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia. ""The Raider family is heartbroken over the tragic loss of our Soldiers. We are ensuring we provide the needed support to their families and our Soldiers as we go through this grieving process. We are an incredibly tight-knit family, and their absence is keenly felt, and we will hold them close in our memories. I want to extend my personal thanks to everyone who assisted in the search and recovery efforts,” said Col. James Armstrong, 1st Armored Brigade Commander. “The Raider Brigade is incredibly appreciative of all the support we received from our Lithuanian and Polish Allies, and our brothers and sisters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who contributed to helping us recover our Soldiers. We will never forget the dedication, commitment and teamwork that enabled us to recover our Soldiers and provide closure for their families. We are truly stronger together."" In addition to the support provided at the site, the Archbishop Metropolitan of Vilnius, Gintaras Grušas, led a mass at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Stanislaus and St. Ladislaus of Vilnius, March 30, to pray for the four Soldiers, their families, and those conducting recovery operations. The service was attended by American and German soldiers deployed to Lithuania, Lithuanian soldiers, senior Lithuanian and American officials, and U.S. and NATO military leaders. Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Minister Dovilė Šakalienė, Lithuanian Armed Forces Commander General Raimundas Vaikšnoras, and Ambassador McDonald also attended. Commander, U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, also attended the service in the Lithuanian capital and later visited the recovery site. “Our sense of partnership drives us forward, and you take care of our Soldiers as if they were your own,” Cavoli told reporters before the mass. NATO also sent assets to assist with recovery efforts. The U.S. Army and Lithuanian authorities are investigating the cause of the accident.

https://buenosairesherald.com/economics/caputo-confirms-us20-billion-deal-between-argentina-and-imf,"Economy Minister Luis Caputo has confirmed that the Argentine government has reached an agreement with the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a US$20 billion loan. The agreement must now be approved by the Fund’s board of directors. IMF spokeswoman Julie Kozack did not give a figure during a Thursday press conference but described the deal as “sizable.”
“What I can say now is that discussions on a new Fund-supported program are very advanced. And those discussions include discussions around a sizable financing package,” she said, but underscored that the final decision over the deal amount would fall to the IMF board. Regarding the payment schedule, she said: “As with all of our programs, disbursements will come in tranches over the life of the program. But the exact phasing and the size of each tranche is also, of course, part of the discussions that are underway.” Caputo spoke about the deal during an insurance conference on Thursday morning. “The sum we’ve agreed on, that the staff will submit for the board’s approval, is US$20 billion,” he said. “As you can see, it’s much higher than the amount that was rumored.” The minister said the IMF did not place the usual fiscal, monetary, and reserve conditions on the deal. He did not specify whether the government’s current 1% monthly crawling peg — the rate at which it devalues the peso against the dollar — would remain in place. President Javier Milei also spoke following Caputo’s announcement. In an interview, he said that IMF Managing Director Kristalina Giorgieva authorized the minister to disclose the amount of the loan last night. Milei also emphatically ruled out the possibility of a devaluation, which market sources take for granted. He said that, after the new loan, there will be “a lack of pesos, not a lack of dollars.” Kozack said that the parties were in ongoing discussions over what policies would be covered by the program but added: “To sustain the gains that have been achieved so far by the authorities, there is a shared recognition about the need to continue to adopt a consistent set of fiscal, monetary, and foreign exchange policies while fostering further and furthering growth-enhancing reforms.” Additional packages Caputo also said that the government is negotiating an additional package with the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (also known as CAF) “to strengthen the Central Bank’s reserves.” Gross reserves, according to Caputo, will increase to US$50 billion thanks to these loans. The monetary base, he said, currently sits at US$25 billion at the official exchange rate and at US$20 billion at the blue-chip swap dollar rate. “We will have double the amount of reserves than the current monetary base.” “Although I can’t give you any more details of the rest of the agreement due to confidentiality clauses, I thought it was important to tell you about the amount,” Caputo said. “Our goal is that, in the future, we can get access to markets again and that Argentina can at least refinance the capital in such a way that reserves continue to back pesos in the Central Bank.” He continued: “Not only is it different from the over 20 previous deals Argentina has had with the IMF, but it is also different from any other deal the IMF has reached with other countries.” Caputo explained that while IMF deals typically consist of the lender making gradual disbursements while demanding fiscal and monetary adjustments to put the country’s economy “in order,” this is not the case for Argentina’s new agreement. “We’ve already carried out those fiscal and monetary adjustments,” he said. After Milei took office in December 2023, the new administration evaluated the possibility of seeking a new loan from the IMF, “which wouldn’t have happened because the Fund would not commit more capital without seeing concrete results,” Caputo said.  Another option was continuing the program from former President Alberto Fernández’s government. “If we focused on the goals fixed for the prior government, we couldn’t have stopped the crisis from happening. It wouldn’t have been enough to stop hyperinflation,” the minister added. In this scenario, Milei’s government decided to take on “much more challenging goals” and refrain from borrowing more money until the IMF was “convinced” that the administration would be able to comply with those goals. “That’s what we did. We ended the fiscal deficit in a month and ended monetary emission in six months,” Caputo said.",Caputo confirms US$20 billion deal between Argentina and IMF staff,Buenos Aires Herald,Buenos Aires Herald,2025-03-27T13:11:39,2025-03-27T19:33:04,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/wildfires/wildfires-continue-rage-carolinas-rcna198328,"The Table Rock wildfire burning in South Carolina continued to grow Thursday, but conditions that created dramatic expansion the day before eased, officials said. The fire, which was started March 21 by hikers, had burned an estimated 8,679 acres by 4:30 p.m. Thursday when a flight captured infrared data, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said. Hundreds of residents in North Carolina and South Carolina have been ordered to leave and structures have been destroyed in the fires, which are burning amid abnormally dry or drought conditions in both states. Downed timber left in the wake of Hurricane Helene, a devastating storm that struck in September, has also been fueling the fires' spread, officials have said. “The amount of downed debris and timber in the woods is almost indescribable,” Madeline Stewart, the South Carolina Forestry Commission Public Information Coordinator, said on NBC’s “TODAY” show. North Carolina fires In North Carolina, there are eight active wildfires in Caldwell, Buncombe, Polk, Jackson, Haywood and Swain counties, according to an interactive map by the North Carolina Forest Service. New fires sparked in dry conditions Wednesday, prompting Gov. Josh Stein to declare another state of emergency “to make sure we have every tool at our disposal” to respond to fires in the western part of the state. The worst blazes are the Black Cove Complex Fire and the Deep Woods Fire, both in Polk County and Henderson County. The Black Cove Complex fire has burned around 3,288 acres and was 17% contained Thursday evening, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture said in an update. The fire first ignited March 19 by a downed power line. ""Fire behavior has continued to be intense, with rapid fire spread and extreme burning conditions due to high winds and dry weather,"" the department said. But on the Deep Woods Fire, there was better news Thursday. There was progress on containment of that fire, which has burned an estimated 3,373 acres in size and was 30% contained by that evening, the department said. It was first reported March 19 and the cause is under investigation. A third fire that had prompted evacuation orders, the Fish Hook Fire, was 199 acres in size and 95% contained. Evacuation orders had previously been lifted. South Carolina fires In South Carolina, the Table Rock Fire and the Persimmon Ridge Fire were the two major wildfires in the state. The Persimmon Ridge Fire ""saw only modest expansion"" Thursday as conditions were milder than what was seen Wednesday, state officials said. The fire grew to 1,992 acres Thursday, but the state forestry department said most of that growth was from ""burnouts"" created by firefighters between existing fire breaks. The Table Rock Fire was started by “the negligent act of some hikers,"" the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office said last week. “The young men that are responsible for the fire have been identified. The investigation is continuing by agents and detectives with the sheriff’s office as well as those with the South Carolina Forestry Commission, and the appropriate charges will be discussed and made at a later date,” Sheriff Tommy Blankenship said in a March 21 statement. On Wednesday, the South Carolina Forestry commission called for the immediate evacuations of residents in Greenville and Pickens counties. “Never in my 52 years did I think would I be running from my home in a fire,” said Wendy Clarke, who evacuated her home in the Caesar's Head area near the Persimmon Ridge Fire to a local shelter.","Hurricane Helene aftermath fuels Carolina fires, prompting new warnings and evacuations","Marlene Lenthang, Phil Helsel",NBC News,2025-03-27T13:54:41.990Z,2025-03-28T03:45:36.699Z,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/wildfires-ravaging-southern-south-korea-leave-24-dead-force-thousands-to-evacuate,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Wind-driven
wildfires
that were among South Korea’s worst ever have ravaged the country’s southern regions, killing 24 people, destroying more than 300 structures and forcing 28,800 residents to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.

The death toll included a pilot who died after a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a blaze in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the hardest-hit areas. The aircraft had no other crew members. Police said that most of the dead are those in their 60s and 70s.

The National Fire Agency said at least 26 people sustained varying degrees of injuries.

An ancient Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 17,752 hectares (43,866 acres), the government’s emergency response center said.

In a televised address, South Korea’s acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were worse than many previous ones.

“Damages are snowballing,” Han said. “There are concerns that we’ll have wildfire damages that we’ve never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week.”

Han said crews struggled to extinguish the wildfires because strong winds swept the areas overnight. He also said about 4,650 firefighters, soldiers and other personnel were working Wednesday with the help of about 130 helicopters, adding that “a small amount” of 5-10 millimeters (0.1-0.3 inches) of rain was expected Thursday.

As of Wednesday evening, firefighters were tackling at least six active wildfires, including in the southeastern coastal town of Yeongdeok, which alerted residents of the nearest village to evacuate to an indoor gymnasium.

Strong winds and smoke-filled skies forced authorities in the southeastern city of Andong to order evacuations in two villages, including Puncheon, home to the Hahoe folk village — a UNESCO World Heritage Site founded around the 14th-15th century. Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri Mountain, one of the country’s largest national parks, as another fire spread closer.

Observers say the ongoing wildfires are the third biggest in South Korea’s history in terms of land burned. The largest fires were in Andong, the neighboring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan.

On Tuesday, officials said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again.

The blaze in Uiseong destroyed about 20 of the 30 buildings and structures at Gounsa, a temple said to be originally built in the 7th century. Among the burned structures were two state-designated “treasures” — a pavilion-shaped building erected overlooking a stream in 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.

Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry said it protectively removed 500 inmates from a detention center in Cheongsong, another southern town, but no damages were reported to the facility.

The Korea Forest Service said it had raised its wildfire warning to the highest level nationwide, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.

Among the dead were
four firefighters and government workers
who died in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds, according to officials.

Government officials suspect human error caused several of the fires, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.","Wildfires ravaging southern South Korea leave 24 dead, force thousands to evacuate","Kim Tong-Hyung, Associated Press, Hyung-Jin Kim, Associated Press",PBS News,2025-03-26T15:50:30,2025-03-26T15:50:30,gemini-2.0-flash

Bashar Assad, Syria’s leader for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia after anti-regime groups took control of Damascus on Dec. 8, ending the Baath Party regime, which had been in power since 1963.

https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-03-25/venezuela-calls-trumps-secondary-tariffs-illegal-and-desperate.html,"The Venezuelan government responded to the new U.S. crackdown on Monday with a message directed at Donald Trump. In a statement from the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry, it rejected the 25% secondary tariffs on Venezuelan oil and gas announced by the U.S. president, calling the measure “arbitrary, illegal, and desperate.” For the Venezuelan government, this move only confirms “the failure of all sanctions imposed against our country.” Throughout Trump’s two and a half years of confrontations with Venezuela and the broader international community, the government — led by President Nicolás Maduro — had maintained some room for negotiation in its public statements. Trump initially signaled a willingness to engage, sending Richard Grenell to meet with Nicolás Maduro at Miraflores in what appeared to be an attempt at rapprochement. However, relations quickly soured as Trump escalated pressure — revoking the license of U.S. oil giant Chevron (whose deadline to cease operations was extended on Monday until May 27), deporting Venezuelans to El Salvador, and now imposing secondary tariffs. Any nation that buys oil or gas from Venezuela will face a 25% tariff on “any trade they do with our country,” Trump said on Monday. In its statement, Venezuela directly addresses Trump, while also dedicating several paragraphs to accusing the Venezuelan opposition. “For years, the fascist right, repudiated by the Venezuelan people, has promoted economic sanctions in the hope of subjugating Venezuela,” the statement reads. The government argues that Trump’s actions violate international trade norms and vows to take legal action in multilateral organizations to defend itself. China is the primary buyer of Venezuelan crude oil and gas, followed by India’s Reliance Industries, with whom Venezuela has sought to strengthen trade ties. However, the newly imposed tariffs, along with the potential halt of Chevron’s operations, threaten Venezuela’s recent recovery in oil production, which had been nearing one million barrels per day after hitting historic lows four years ago. Other key partners include Spain, which continues operations through Repsol under compliance letters issued in the final phase of Joe Biden’s sanctions framework in 2024. Other buyers of Venezuelan oil include Cuba, Russia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Dominican Republic. These secondary tariffs on exports to the United States, which could also affect countries trading Venezuelan crude, echo the secondary sanctions Trump imposed in 2019 during his first administration. At the time, Russia’s Rosneft was penalized by Washington for conducting business with Venezuela. In response, Venezuela was forced to develop a costly underground system to sell its oil at steep discounts, using opaque barter agreements and transshipment via shadow ships. “Imperial announcements only motivate us to work harder,” Maduro declared on Monday in response to the White House’s decision. The full impact of these tariffs, set to take effect on April 2 — a date Trump has called “Liberation Day” in his announcement on Truth Social — remains to be seen, particularly in how they will affect the remaining trade relationships of Venezuela’s partners.

https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/new-canadian-prime-minister-carney-will-run-in-ottawa-area-district-as-he-seeks-to-join-parliament-1868494,"TORONTO: New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will run in an Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament for the first time, two officials familiar with the matter said Saturday, a day before Carney triggers an early general election before a vote on April 28. The election will take place against the backdrop of a trade war and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Carney will run to represent the suburban Ottawa area of Nepean. The election campaign for 343 seats or districts in the House of Commons will last 37 days. The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister. Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader on March 9 following a leadership race by the governing party. Carney, sworn in as Canada’s 24th prime minister on March 14, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate. The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war. Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has upended Canadian politics. What Trump hasn’t said is that the almost daily attacks on Canada’s sovereignty have infuriated Canadians. That has led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers. The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump. Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. Carney still hasn’t had a phone call with Trump and that might not happen now until after the election. Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but he has not yet mentioned Carney’s name. Carney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013, he became the first noncitizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England — helping to manage the impact of Brexit. Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney’s main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada’s federal election this year until Trump’s near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them. Poilievre, 45, for years the party’s go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put “Canada first.” He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada’s public broadcaster. His party announced that it won’t allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes.",New Canadian Prime Minister Carney will run in Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament,AP,Deccan Chronicle,2025-03-23T07:09:14,2025-03-23T07:09:14,gemini-2.0-flash

Tina Kotek has declared a state of emergency over to deadly flooding and landslides in Southern Oregon. The declaration was made due to the damage caused by ongoing storms that have impacted the state since Feb. 24. Those storms have led to significant flooding and landslides across the state and resulted in at least one fatality, according to state officials. READ MORE: Storm brings flooding, landslides to SW Oregon; one person drowns in floodwaters The emergency declaration allows responders to use all necessary and appropriate resources in disaster response. The Oregon Department of Transportation is out doing repairs on roadways, clearing debris, and shoring up hillsides to prevent further landslides. ""Early estimates for repairs for damaged two roads are about $10 million,"" said ODOT spokesperson Julie Denny. ""It is an early estimate and we expect after assessing more that that will change."" Denny said ODOT crews still have quite a lot of work to do, and they will seek federal reimbursement for damages that occurred during the emergency. “When emergencies hit, Oregon families and businesses need to know we have their back in every part of the state,” Kotek said in a press release. The declaration includes Clackamas, Coos, Curry, Douglas, Harney, Jackson, Josephine, Lane, Multnomah, and Malheur counties. ""It got to the point where we couldn't get our car or truck out it was too deep,"" said Ron Heaton of Sutherlin. “Recovery starts as soon as disaster strikes, and this declaration will help get Oregonians back to normal as soon as possible. I urge everyone to follow the instructions and evacuation levels issued by emergency officials, subscribe emergency alerts on ORAlert.gov, have an evacuation plan, prepare a go-kit, and stay aware of changing conditions,” she added. The Oregon Department of Emergency Management activated the State Emergency Coordination Center to Level 3 on March 17. That means the state is coordinating closely with local, Tribal, and state partners to share information and support local response and recovery operations as needed, officials said.

""This marks a significant milestone in our partnership, reflecting our shared vision to deepen trade ties and expand economic opportunities,"" Goyal said on microblogging site X after meeting McClay.""With bilateral trade continuing to grow steadily surpassing $1 billion during April-Jan 2025, the FTA negotiations aim to unlock new avenues for businesses and consumers, fostering mutual growth and prosperity of our nations,"" said Goyal.The India-New Zealand FTA negotiations aim to achieve balanced outcomes that enhance supply chain integration and improve market access. This milestone reflects a shared vision for a stronger economic partnership, fostering resilience and prosperity, said a statement from the commerce and industry ministry.Talks between the two countries had started in April 2010 to deepen trade in goods & services, and investment but stalled after 10 rounds of negotiations due to a raft of issues, including disagreements over market access and trade priorities.

https://www.arabnews.com/node/2593636/middle-east,"MANAMA: Bahrain’s first domestically designed and developed satellite, Al-Munther, was launched successfully on Saturday. The project, spearheaded by the National Space Science Agency, marks a milestone for Bahrain’s space ambitions. The 3U CubeSat is the first satellite in the region to integrate artificial intelligence for onboard image processing. Mohammed Ibrahim Al-Aseeri, CEO of the National Space Science Agency, told Arab News: “The successful launch of Bahrain’s Al-Munther satellite into orbit marks a major milestone in the kingdom’s space journey. I take immense pride in the achievements of the National Space Science Agency team, who have successfully placed Al-Munther in orbit, paving the way for initial operations and in-orbit system testing.” Al-Aseeri said Al-Munther was a remarkable national accomplishment, entirely designed and developed by Bahraini talent. The NSSA team played a key role in innovating, designing and building its payloads, leaving their mark on the rapidly evolving global space industry. He added: “Designed and developed entirely by Bahrainis, Al-Munther is a significant national accomplishment. This success reflects our commitment to the royal vision of positioning Bahrain as a leader in space and supports national development, Bahrain’s Economic Vision 2030 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.” The satellite features an Earth observation camera, a cybersecurity system, and a unique broadcast function that will transmit Bahrain’s national anthem and a message from King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa. It will operate in a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 550 km and is expected to have a two-year lifespan. The launch took place onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Vandenberg Space Launch Complex in California. Reem Abdulla Senan, head of satellite communication operations, said: “One of the most significant achievements of the Al-Munther mission is the development of a Bahraini-operated software system to manage the satellite and its payloads. This not only advances the nationalization of space technologies but also strengthens Bahrain’s autonomy in satellite operations. The software enables the satellite to efficiently carry out its designated tasks, including data collection, processing and transmission to Earth.” She added the ground station established in Bahrain would play a critical role in overseeing Al-Munther’s operations. “The station allows us to manage the satellite with high precision, support future space missions and even receive data from other free satellites operating on the same frequencies,” she said. “The successful initial contact between the satellite and the ground station after launch will mark a pivotal moment — confirming the communication system is functioning as intended and initiating the structured commencement of scientific operations.” Al-Munther, which means “herald” or “messenger,” symbolizes Bahrain’s forward-looking vision and commitment to innovation. It highlights the kingdom’s dedication to building a sustainable space infrastructure, fostering research and development and inspiring future generations to pursue advancements in science and technology. LONDON: Jordan’s Prime Minister Jafar Hassan cautioned on Tuesday against acts of “political opportunism” and any activities that might undermine public safety. Speaking during a Cabinet meeting in Ajloun, he said: “The Jordanian state’s forbearance cannot be subjected to testing, nor can any entity prevail against it through performative displays or populist demagoguery, or jeopardize public welfare for any cause whatsoever,” the Jordan News Agency reported. “Nothing transcends Jordan’s interests” and there is “no space for external loyalties or subversive elements seeking to propagate instability and impede national progress,” he added. “Within Jordan’s borders, sovereignty is exclusively vested in constitutional legitimacy, with authority concentrated solely in state institutions and our independent judiciary.” The prime minister’s comments came a week after Jordanian authorities said they foiled a series of plots that threatened the country’s national security. They arrested 16 people accused of planning acts of chaos and sabotage, and seized weapons including missiles, explosives and firearms. Hassan said national unity is essential to the country’s strength and any attempt to compromise it “constitutes direct opposition to Jordan’s national interests and its citizenry.” DAMASCUS: Syrian authorities said Tuesday they had arrested a former officer in the feared security apparatus of ousted ruler Bashar Assad, the latest such announcement as the new government pursues ex-officials accused of atrocities.The interior ministry announced in a statement that security forces in the coastal province of Latakia had arrested the “criminal brigadier-general Sultan Al-Tinawi,” saying he was a key officer in the air force intelligence, one of the Assad family’s most trusted security agencies.The statement accused Tinawi of involvement in “committing war crimes against civilians, including a massacre” in the Damascus countryside in 2016.It said he was responsible for “coordinating between the leadership of the Lebanese Hezbollah militia and a number of sectarian groups in Syria.”Tinawi has been referred to the public prosecution for further investigation, the statement said.A security source, requesting anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media, said that Tinawi held senior administrative positions in the air force intelligence when Jamil Hassan was head of the notorious agency.Hassan has been sentenced in absentia in France for complicity in crimes against humanity and war crimes, while the United States has accused him of “war crimes,” including overseeing barrel bomb attacks on Syrian people that killed thousands of civilians.Tinawi had been “head of the information branch of the air force intelligence” before Assad’s ouster late last year, the security source told AFP, describing the branch as “one of the most powerful and secret security agencies in the country.”Since taking power in December, Syria’s new authorities have announced a number of arrests of Assad-era security officials.Assad fled to Moscow with only a handful of confidants, abandoning senior officials and security officers, some of whom have reportedly fled to neighboring countries or taken refuge in the coastal heartland of Assad’s Alawite minority community. JERUSALEM: The Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, on Tuesday hailed Pope Francis’s support for Gazans and engagement with the small Catholic community in the war-battered Palestinian territory.The Catholic church’s highest authority in the region, who is considered a potential successor to the late pontiff, Pizzaballa told journalists in Jerusalem that “Gaza represents, a little bit, all what was the heart of his pontificate.”Pope Francis, who died on Monday aged 88, advocated peace and “closeness to the poor... and to the neglected one,” said the patriarch.These positions became particularly evident in Francis’s response to the Israel-Hamas war which broke out in October 2023, Pizzaballa said.“He was very close to the community of Gaza, the parish of Gaza, he kept calling them many times — for a certain period, also every day, every evening at 7 pm,” said the patriarch.He added that by doing so, the pope “became for the community something stable, and also comforting for them, and he knew this.”Out of the Gaza Strip’s 2.4 million people, about 1,000 are Christians. Most of them are Orthodox, but according to the Latin Patriarchate, there are about 135 Catholics in the territory.Since the early days of the war, members of the Catholic community have been sheltering at Holy Family Church compound in Gaza City, and some Orthodox Christians have also found refuge there.Pope Francis repeatedly called for an end to the war. The day before his death, in a final Easter message delivered on Sunday, he condemned the “deplorable humanitarian situation” in the besieged territory.“Work for justice... but without becoming part of the conflict,” said Pizzaballa of the late pontiff’s actions.“For us, for the Church, it leaves an important legacy.”The patriarch thanked the numerous Palestinian and Israeli public figures who have offered their condolences, preferring not to comment on the lack of any official message from Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Even as “the local authorities... were not always happy” with the pope’s positions or statements, they were “always very respectful,” he said.Pizzaballa said he will travel to Rome on Wednesday, after leading a requiem mass for the pope at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem in the morning.As one of the 135 cardinal electors, the Latin patriarch will participate in the conclave to elect a new pope.Pizzaballa, a 60-year-old Italian Franciscan who also speaks English and Hebrew, arrived in Jerusalem in 1990 and was made a cardinal in September 2023, just before the Gaza war began.His visits to Gaza and appeals for peace since then have attracted international attention. LONDON: Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the UAE minister of foreign affairs, met Sri Lanka’s president and foreign minister in Colombo during an official visit on Tuesday. Sheikh Abdullah and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake discussed ways to enhance bilateral cooperation in various sectors, building on strong and evolving ties between the UAE and Sri Lanka. He highlighted the UAE’s commitment to enhancing cooperation with Sri Lanka to support the development goals of both countries, the Emirates News Agency reported. The UAE is committed to partnering with friendly countries to enhance prosperity and sustainable development, he added. President Dissanayake commended the strong relationship between Abu Dhabi and Colombo, WAM reported. Sheikh Abdullah spoke with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Vijitha Herath, about opportunities for enhancing cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, tourism and development. The ministers exchanged views on several regional and international issues, and attended the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka. The memorandum, signed on Tuesday by Saeed Mubarak Al-Hajeri, the Emirati assistant minister for economic and trade affairs, and Lakmal Fernando, vice president of the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, aims to establish the UAE-Sri Lanka Joint Business Council. Khaled Nasser Al-Ameri, the UAE’s ambassador to Sri Lanka, attended the meetings along with senior Emirati officials. JUBA: South Sudan’s opposition accused government forces of attacking one of its military positions in Central Equatoria State on Tuesday as their fragile power-sharing agreement continues to unravel.Central Equatoria State, which includes the capital Juba, was split into areas controlled by government and opposition forces under a 2018 power-sharing deal that ended South Sudan’s five-year civil war, in which an estimated 400,000 people died.The agreement brought President Salva Kiir and his long-time rival, Vice President Riek Machar, together in a unity government.But the deal has been unraveling in recent months as Kiir moves to sideline Machar, who was placed under house arrest last month.“The SSPDF (South Sudan People’s Defense Forces) has attacked Panyume cantonment site from multiple directions this morning,” opposition party spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said on Facebook.“Clashes are still ongoing and details will follow later,” he added.Facing sustained attacks on its positions, the opposition forces commander directed his troops to prepare for conflict, according to another statement by Gabriel on Tuesday.“Lt.

The Russia-Ukraine war is on the agenda Thursday as foreign ministers from the G7 group of leading industrial nations meet in Canada amid a push to secure a ceasefire in the conflict. The talks in Quebec follow U.S.-Ukraine talks that included a U.S. proposal for ""an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire,"" which Ukrainian leaders said they were ready to accept. ""We must move toward peace. We must move toward security guarantees,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during his nightly address Wednesday. ""The key factor is our partners’ ability to ensure Russia’s readiness not to deceive but to genuinely end the war."" The Kremlin has said it was waiting to hear about the ceasefire proposal from U.S. officials. The White House said Wednesday that national security adviser Steve Witkoff was heading to Moscow for talks in the coming days. The G7 talks bring together ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly, who is hosting the meetings, said Canada welcomes the U.S. proposal to halt the fighting in Ukraine and that a ceasefire is ""the first step toward a just and lasting peace."" ""The ball is now in Russia’s court to show that it is likewise ready for a ceasefire and to put an end to the bloodshed. The world is watching,"" Joly said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters en route to Canada on Wednesday that the U.S. will have ""multiple points of contact"" with Russia to assess its willingness for the peace deal. ""Now, we all eagerly await the Russian response, and urge them strongly to consider ending all hostilities … so a process can begin to find a permanent peace,"" Rubio told VOA on Wednesday. Rubio added there is a need for monitors if Russia agrees to a ceasefire. ""If they [Russians] say yes, one of the things we'll have to determine is who do both sides trust to be on the ground to sort of monitor some of the small arms fire and exchanges that could happen,"" Rubio told reporters. At the White House on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said it was ""up to Russia now"" to respond. ""And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia,"" he said. ""And if we do, I think that would be 80% of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath finished."" Trump is hosting NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for talks Thursday at the White House.

https://abc7.com/post/3-suspected-fentanyl-traffickers-arrested-charged-55-million-drug-bust-downey/16008095/,"DOWNEY, Calif. (CNS) -- Authorities announced the arrests of three suspected fentanyl traffickers and the seizure of 14 million lethal doses of the drug with an estimated street value of about $55 million, along with heroin and methamphetamine. ""To say that this investigation has saved thousands of lives is an understatement,"" Downey Police Chief Scott Lougher said at a news conference in downtown Los Angeles Tuesday, where he was joined by State Attorney General Rob Bonta and Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman. Priscilla Gomez, 43, of Torrance; her brother, Gustavo Omar Gomez, 47, of Huntington Park; and Carlos Manuel Mariscal, 38, of Huntington Park, are facing felony counts in connection with the investigation, according to Hochman. Bonta said investigators had ""reliable information"" that led them to Priscilla Gomez, whom he described as a ""courier"" who was stopped by Downey police in a traffic stop. ""She acknowledged the possession of some drugs and also a K-9 was activated at the stop,"" the attorney general said. Investigators subsequently served a search warrant at an apartment in Downey, Hochman said. Downey police found more than 50 pounds of fentanyl and nearly 12 pounds of opium in a car and in the apartment Jan. 22, according to the District Attorney's Office. The attorney general said investigators also saw ""indicia of a Mexican cartel."" ""Some cartels are known for certain decor symbols, insignias. They were present,"" Bonta said. The district attorney noted that the 50-pound seizure of fentanyl in one afternoon exceeded the total amount seized at the U.S.-Canada border in an entire year by seven pounds. ""This one seizure could have killed literally every resident in L.A. County by itself,"" Hochman said. Priscilla Gomez -- who is currently in federal custody -- is charged with three counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance and one count sale/transportation/offer to sell controlled substance. Her brother is charged with two counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance, while Mariscal is charged with two counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance and one count each of possession of a silencer and unlawful possession of ammunition prohibited by a prior conviction, Hochman said.

https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202503120011,"Taipei, March 12 (CNA) Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) told lawmakers on Wednesday that Taiwan's government ""does not have the capacity"" to spend 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) annually on national defense. ""It is impossible [for the government] to allocate more than NT$2 trillion (US$60.73 billion) for defense spending, given the current central government's budget scale,"" Cho said at the Legislature. Taiwan's central government budgets for both 2024 and 2025 are nearly NT$3 trillion, with social welfare spending the largest expenditures. The premier was responding to questions from Kuomintang legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi (傅崐萁) about how the government would react if the United States urged Taiwan to increase its defense budget to 10 percent of GDP. Fu said 10 percent would be NT$2.68 trillion, based on a government 2025 GDP estimate of NT$26.88 trillion. U.S. President Donald Trump had previously touched upon the issue during his presidential campaign, calling on Taiwan to raise its defense spending to as much as 10 percent. The calls were renewed earlier this month by Trump's pick for undersecretary of defense for policy Elbridge Colby in a Senate hearing. Trump ""has made the same demand [for defense budget increases] not only of Taiwan but also of many other countries,"" Cho said. ""Currently, the Republic of China (Taiwan's official name) does not have the capability to allocate a defense budget of NT$2.6 trillion,"" he said, adding that the budget would be determined based on the country's financial capacity and military needs. Taiwan's Cabinet had earmarked NT$647 billion for defense spending in 2025, equal to 2.45 percent of GDP, some of which was later cut or frozen by the opposition-controlled Legislature. President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) later pledged to propose a special budget to raise defense spending to over 3 percent of GDP, though that, too, would require legislative approval. On Wednesday, Cho denied claims made by former legislator Kuo Cheng-liang (郭正亮) in a recent political talk show that Washington had urged Taipei to extend compulsory military service from the current one year to two. There were no such discussions in the government or requests from the U.S., Cho said, stressing that ""the status quo remains unchanged.""",Raising Taiwan's defense spending to 10% of GDP 'impossible': Premier,Liu Kuan-ting and Teng Pei-ju,Focus Taiwan,2025-03-12T14:15:00,2025-03-12T14:31:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/asia/iran-china-russia-joint-navy-drills-intl-hnk/index.html,"Warships from Iran, China and Russia kicked off their annual joint exercises in the Gulf of Oman on Monday, showing off their military ties as US President Donald Trump upends longstanding Western alliances. The “Security Belt-2025” drills, taking place near the Iranian port of Chabahar, is the fifth joint naval exercise Iran, China and Russia have held since 2019, according to Chinese state media. Analysts have long seen the drills as a demonstration of the growing partnership among the three authoritarian powers as they seek to counterbalance US influence and challenge the Western-led global order. But this year, the optics are even more pronounced as Trump disrupts the transatlantic alliance – a cornerstone of Western security for decades – by embracing Russia at the expense of Ukraine, and pushes Asian allies to pay more for US protection. Asked about the drills on Sunday, Trump said he is “not at all” concerned about the show of force by the three US adversaries. “We’re stronger than all of them. We have more power than all of them,” he told Fox News aboard Air Force One. Concerns have been mounting in Washington about the emerging strategic partnership among China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, which US lawmakers have described as an “axis of authoritarianism,” “axis of autocrats” and “axis of dictators.” The fear is that a shared animosity toward the US is increasingly driving these countries to work together – amplifying the threat that any one of them alone poses to Washington or its allies, not just in one region but perhaps in multiple parts of the world at the same time. At the same time, Trump has openly embraced Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a bid to end the war in Ukraine by talking directly to Moscow while leaving Kyiv and European allies on the sidelines. Russia and North Korea’s military relationship has strengthened considerably over the last year, with the two signing a mutual defense agreement and Pyongyang sending its troops to fight for Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine. The drills also come amid heightened tension between US and Iran. Related articleChina’s warships are turning up in unexpected places and alarming US allies. Is this the new normal? Since returning to the White House, Trump has restored what he calls his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in an attempt to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon – a move denounced by Tehran as “bullying” tactics. The Gulf of Oman is a crucial gateway connecting the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Hormuz, through which more than one-quarter of the world’s seaborne traded oil passes. The US maintains its own significant presence in the region via the Fifth Fleet which is based out of nearby Bahrain. Russia’s Defense Ministry said the joint naval exercises will involve 15 combat ships, support vessels and gunboats, as well as helicopters, according to state news agencyTASS. “The Russian side is represented by the Rezky and Russian Hero Aldar Tsydenzhapov corvettes, and the Pechenega tanker of the Pacific Fleet,” the ministry is quoted as saying. China, meanwhile, deployed the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Baotou and supply ship Gaoyouhu from a nearby naval escort task force to take part in the exercise, the Chinese Defense Ministry said in astatement. The drills, with an aim to “enhance military trust and strengthen practical cooperation,” will include simulated strikes on maritime targets, visit-board-search-seizure operations and search and rescue drills, the ministry added. Iran has sent a stealth missile corvette and a patrol ship, according to Iranian state media.","Iran, China and Russia launch annual joint naval drills as Trump upends Western alliances",Nectar Gan,CNN,2025-03-10T06:50:01,2025-03-10T06:50:01,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.axios.com/2025/03/09/us-trump-israel-hamas-gaza-talks,"White House envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to travel to Doha on Tuesday evening in an effort to broker a new hostage-release and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, two U.S. officials said. Why it matters: The talks would be the first since President Trump took office and since the original agreement between Israel and Hamas that established a 42-day ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of 33 hostages in its first phase, which ended one week ago. Witkoff is expected to join Qatari and Egyptian mediators and negotiators from Israel and Hamas who will begin talks on Monday. The Trump administration is pushing for a deal that would lead to the release of all remaining hostages, extend the ceasefire until after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover and possibly lead to a long-term truce that would end the war. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces have confirmed 35 are dead. Israeli intelligence believes 22 are still alive and the status of two others is unknown. Among the remaining hostages are five Americans, including 21-year-old Edan Alexander who is believed to be alive. Driving the news: Axios reported earlier this week that Trump's envoy for hostage affairs Adam Boehler has been holding direct talks with Hamas officials. Their last meeting took place last Tuesday. During the talks, Boehler discussed the possible release of Alexander and the remains of four other American hostages as a way to launch a broader deal on the release of all remaining hostages and a long term truce. State of play: Witkoff is expected to travel to Doha after participating in a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. It is unclear if he is going to meet with Hamas officials or only with Israeli negotiators and Qatari and Egyptian mediators. A senior Israeli official said Witkoff wanted to get all the parties in one place for several days of intense negotiations in an effort to reach a deal. A Hamas delegation held talks in Cairo on Saturday with the director of the Egyptian intelligence service about the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal. Hamas said in a statement it urges all parties to implement their commitment to the original deal and begin negotiations over its second phase immediately. Israel has so far refused to seriously discuss the second phase of the deal. Hamas also said it stressed to the Egyptian officials that it is ready to form a committee of ""national independent personalities"" to govern Gaza until elections are held. Such a step would mean Hamas would give up its control over the civilian governance in Gaza. What to watch: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting with a group of senior ministers and the heads of the security services on Saturday to discuss the next steps in the Gaza deal.

https://bulgarianmilitary.com/2025/03/04/houthis-claim-another-mq-9-trophy-in-their-sky-high-standoff/,"On March 4, 2025, Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed to have shot down yet another U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone, an unmanned aerial vehicle valued at over $30 million, over the Hodeida district in western Yemen. According to a statement from the Houthi armed forces, their air defenses successfully targeted the drone while it was allegedly conducting hostile operations in Yemeni airspace. If confirmed, this incident would mark the 15th MQ-9 Reaper downed by the Iran-backed group since the onset of their intensified campaign in late 2023, a period that coincides with the escalation of regional tensions tied to the Israel-Hamas war. US keeps 90 unmanned F-16s flying strong for next decade now Russian Su-35’s daring drone flyby leaves France hard fuming Russian expert: Even US stops aid, Ukraine won’t fall easily If confirmed, this incident would mark the 15th MQ-9 Reaper downed by the Iran-backed group since the onset of their intensified campaign in late 2023, a period that coincides with the escalation of regional tensions tied to the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. military has not yet responded to the latest claim, though officials have previously acknowledged some losses while disputing the total number of drones the Houthis assert they have destroyed. The incident, reported by Houthi-aligned media and circulating on social platforms, underscores the ongoing challenge the group poses to American aerial operations in the region. Yemeni military claims to have shot down another MQ-9 Reaper drone worth over $30 millionit would be the 15th Reaper shot down over Yemen. The MQ-9 Reaper, produced by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a cornerstone of the U.S. military’s unmanned fleet, designed to fulfill a dual role of intelligence gathering and precision strikes. Introduced in 2007 as an evolution of the earlier MQ-1 Predator, the Reaper represents a significant leap in capability, blending advanced surveillance technology with lethal firepower. Measuring 36 feet in length with a wingspan of 66 feet, the drone is powered by a Honeywell TPE331-10 turboprop engine, enabling it to reach speeds of up to 240 miles per hour and maintain flight for as long as 24 hours, depending on its configuration and payload. Its operational ceiling reaches 50,000 feet, allowing it to loiter above targets at altitudes beyond the reach of many conventional air defense systems. This endurance and altitude make it an ideal platform for persistent surveillance over vast areas, a feature that has proven invaluable in conflict zones like Yemen, where the U.S. has long sought to monitor and counter extremist groups such as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite, the Reaper carries a multi-spectral targeting system that includes electro-optical and infrared cameras, capable of tracking targets day or night in all weather conditions. It also features synthetic aperture radar for mapping terrain and detecting movement, alongside signals intelligence equipment that can intercept communications. This array of sensors feeds real-time data to operators, often stationed thousands of miles away in facilities like Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, who control the drone via satellite link. On the offensive side, the Reaper can be armed with a variety of munitions, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and, in some configurations, GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions. With a payload capacity of approximately 3,850 pounds, it can carry up to 14 Hellfire missiles, a stark contrast to the Predator’s maximum of two. This combination of long endurance, high-altitude operation, and precision strike capability has made the MQ-9 a workhorse for the U.S. military and the Central Intelligence Agency, deployed extensively in counterterrorism missions across the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. Despite its technological prowess, the Reaper is not invulnerable, as the Houthis have repeatedly demonstrated. The group’s campaign against U.S. drones in Yemen has intensified since November 2023, when they began targeting American assets in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict, framing their actions as solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The first reported downing of an MQ-9 Reaper by the Houthis occurred earlier, in 2017 when the rebels claimed to have used a surface-to-air missile to destroy a drone over northern Yemen. Another followed in 2019, with the U.S. acknowledging the loss but offering few details. The pace of these incidents accelerated dramatically in 2023, beginning with a confirmed shootdown on November 8 over international waters off Yemen’s coast, an event the Pentagon attributed to Houthi air defenses. In 2024, the losses mounted. On February 20, a Reaper was downed near Hodeida, followed by another on April 27 over Saada province, where Houthi footage showed wreckage bearing General Atomics markings. May saw two more incidents: one on May 17 in Marib province and another on May 29 in the same region, both accompanied by Houthi videos of debris. September proved particularly costly, with the U.S. acknowledging two Reapers lost on September 8 and September 18, the latter in Marib, though the Pentagon disputed the Houthis’ claim of a higher total. The campaign continued into late 2024 and early 2025. On November 8, 2024, videos emerged of a flaming aircraft crashing in al-Jawf province, which the Houthis identified as another Reaper, though the U.S. military described it only as an ongoing investigation. December 28, 2024, brought a confirmed downing over Al Bayda governorate, followed four days later, on January 1, 2025, by another in Marib, marking the 13th and 14th losses according to Houthi tallies. Each incident has been trumpeted by the group as evidence of their growing military prowess, often with footage of wreckage or missile launches released through their media channels. The U.S. response has typically been measured, confirming some losses while conducting retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets, including missile launchers and radar sites, as part of operations like Poseidon Archer. Yet the precise circumstances of many shootdowns remain murky, with the Pentagon occasionally attributing crashes to technical failures rather than enemy action, a claim the Houthis dismiss as propaganda. Speculation about the weapons responsible for these downings centers on the Houthis’ evolving air defense capabilities, bolstered by Iranian support. One likely candidate is the 358 missile, a loitering surface-to-air system first identified in Yemen in 2019. Developed by Iran, this missile combines features of a drone and a traditional missile, using a solid rocket booster for launch and a turbojet engine for sustained flight. With a range estimated at 100 kilometers and an altitude capability exceeding 10 kilometers, it is designed to engage low-flying or hovering targets like helicopters and drones. Its imaging infrared seeker and satellite navigation allow it to loiter in an area, waiting for a target to appear, making it a plausible threat to the Reaper’s operational profile. The Houthis have also been linked to older Soviet-era systems, such as the SA-6 Gainful, inherited from pre-war Yemeni military stocks, though these are less suited to the Reaper’s high-altitude flights. More advanced Iranian designs, like the Sayyad-2C or variants of the Taer series, could also be in play, offering ranges and guidance systems capable of challenging U.S. drones. While the Houthis claim some missiles are “locally produced,” experts widely agree that their arsenal relies heavily on Tehran’s technology and supply lines, despite Iran’s denials and a U.N. arms embargo. The repeated downing of MQ-9 Reapers over Yemen raises uncomfortable questions about the drone’s role in the region and the broader U.S. strategy there. At over $30 million apiece, the financial toll of these losses—potentially approaching half a billion dollars if the Houthi count holds—adds up quickly, even for a military with a budget in the hundreds of billions. More troubling is the symbolic cost: each downed drone fuels Houthi propaganda and undermines the perception of American technological dominance. The Reaper’s strengths—its ability to linger over targets and deliver precise strikes—also expose its weaknesses, particularly its reliance on an unjammed satellite link and its lack of agility against increasingly sophisticated air defenses. As the Houthis refine their tactics and weaponry, possibly with Iranian guidance, the U.S. faces a dilemma. Escalating airstrikes risks further entanglement in Yemen’s complex civil war while reducing drone deployments could cede valuable intelligence and strike capabilities. For now, the skies over Yemen remain a proving ground not just for the Reaper’s resilience, but for the limits of American power projection in an era of persistent, asymmetric threats. The frequency of these incidents in recent months suggests that neither side is backing down, leaving open the question of how long this costly aerial chess game can continue without a decisive shift. *** Follow us everywhere and at any time.

While no decision has been made, anonymous sources told Bloomberg that the government of Panama is weighing the possibility of canceling the contracts. President José Raúl Mulino has not yet commented on the matter. The development comes after Rubio's visit to Panama, where he told President Mulino that steps must be taken to curb China's ""unacceptable"" influence over the US-built canal. Even though the Panama Canal is run by an autonomous entity overseen by the Panamanian government, the U.S. government claims China exerts influence through a Hong Kong-based company that operates ports on both ends of the waterway. ""People will argue, well, that's not China; that's a company based in Hong Kong. Well, a company based in Hong Kong is the Government of China. You are not a company in China if the Chinese Government doesn't control you,"" Rubio said in an interview with conservative journalistMegyn Kelly. ""If there's a conflict and China tells them 'do everything you can to obstruct the canal so that the U.S. can't engage in trade and commerce, so that the U.S. military and naval fleet cannot get to the Indo-Pacific fast enough'—They would have to do it, and they would do it. And now we'd have a major problem on our hands,"" he added. During Rubio's visit, President Mulino announced that his government wouldwithdraw from China's signature lending program, Belt and Road Initiative, which finances infrastructure across several continents. The Panamanian leader added thatU.S. warships would be granted free passagethrough the canal, addressing a complaint by former President Donald Trump, who said the U.S. Navy was paying ""exorbitant"" rates to pass through. During his inauguration speech, Trump vowed to take back the Panama Canal. The president claimed that the U.S. has ""been treated very badly by this foolish gift that should have never been made,"" referring to an agreement with the Latin American country that would eventually lead to Panama retaining full control of the canal. He further claimed that ""China is controlling the Panama Canal"" and said, ""We're taking it back."" Trump has accused Panama of favoring China over the U.S. According toBloomberg, about 75% of the cargo transiting through the Panama Canal goes to or from the US, making it the biggest beneficiary of the route. © 2025 Latin Times.

https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/138797/Ahead-of-Emergency-Arab-Summit-on-Gaza-Egyptian-FM-holds,"CAIRO – 3 March 2025: Ahead of the Emergency Arab Summit on Gaza to take place in Cairo on Tuesday, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Immigration Badr Abdelatty held a series of meetings with counterparts to discuss Egypt's plan on reconstructing Gaza without displacing Palestinians and working towards the two-state solution.
	
	
	The Egyptian minister and his Jordanian counterpart, Ayman al-Safady, reiterated Monday both states' rejection to the displacement of Palestinians. They equally asserted the salience of concerting regional and international efforts to ensure the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, as a first step on the pathway of establishing a Palestinian state on the borders of June 4, 1967 having as capital Eastern Jerusalem.
	
	
	The Egyptian minister met Sunday his Iraqi counterpart, Fouad Hussein, expressing support to Iraq's security and stability, and keenness on fully implementing bilateral projects, and trilateral projects with Jordan.
	
	
	The Egyptian and Iraqi ministers also conferred over the updates in Syria, so as Abdelatty underscored Egypt's support to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, launching an inclusive political process that would lead up to elections, and combating terrorism and extremism for Syria not to become a source of instability in the region.
	
	
	Minister Abdelatty met Monday his Yemeni counterpart, Shaea Mohsen al-Zandani, underlining Egypt's backing to the unity of Yemen, independence, territorial integrity and state institutions. The minister pointed out that Yemen's security and stability are essential to guarantee security in the Middle East and Red Sea.
	
	
	The Egyptian minister also expressed support to endeavors aimed at achieving a political solution to the rift in Yemen, as it will equally end the humanitarian suffering in the country. In a related context, Abdelatty shed light on the food and medical supplies Egypt has granted to Yemen, in addition to hosting large numbers of Yemenis providing them with basic services.
	
	
	 
	The Egyptian minister met Palestinian Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohamed Mostafa to discuss hosting another conference - in partnership with the United Nations - on Gaza reconstruction. The two sides also exchanged views on updates in the enclave and ongoing Israeli violence in the West Bank.
	
	
	
	
	Minister Abdelatty stressed to his Tunisian counterpart, Mohamed Ali al-Nafty, the necessity of maintaining the regularity of holding meetings among joint specialized committees in order to preserve the recent growth of relations.
	
	
	
	
	Similarly, bilateral relations were the major topic in the meeting of the Egyptian minister and his Bahraini counterpart, Abdel Latif Bin Rashed al-Zayani, as the former stressed the importance of expanding cooperation in various fields, and coordination on regional issues.
	
	
	
	The meeting of Minister Abdelatty and his Mauritanian counterpart, Mohamed Salem Ould Merzoug, also focused on reinforcing collaboration in different sectors, so as the former expressed aspiration to convening a supreme joint committee to agree on certain plans, mainly concerning trade and economic aspects.
	
	
	The Egyptian minister further commended the current coordination with Mauritania on Arab and African affairs of mutual interest.",Ahead of Emergency Arab Summit on Gaza: Egyptian FM holds series of meetings with counterparts,Noha El Tawil,egypttoday.com,2025-03-03T01:36,2025-03-03T01:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202503/01/content_WS67c3046cc6d0868f4e8f02fc.html,"BEIJING, March 1 -- China's national ""two sessions,"" a key political event shaping the country's policy direction, are set to convene in Beijing next week against the backdrop of a complex and challenging domestic and global environment. The annual session of the top political advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, will commence on Tuesday. The session of the top legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), will open on Wednesday. The Chinese premier, top legislator, top political advisor, chief justice, and top procurator will present work reports. Lawmakers will review the government's annual budget and development plan. They will deliberate an amendment to the law on deputies to the NPC and local people's congresses. On the sidelines of the event, ministers from various government departments will engage with the public through interviews and press conferences, clarifying policies and responding to pressing concerns. The ""two sessions"" serve as a critical window to observe China's development plan for the coming year. Decisions and policy announcements made here will not only affect the lives of 1.4 billion Chinese but also have an impact outside the country's borders. So, what can be expected from this year's ""two sessions""? GROWTH TARGET FOR 2025 Typically, the GDP growth target set in the government work report is one of the most closely watched figures. As China's economy shifts toward high-quality development, GDP is not the sole measure of the economy. But it remains an important indicator. In 2024, China achieved its growth target of around 5 percent, thanks in large part to a series of significant macroeconomic measures introduced to offset economic downturn pressure. GDP growth serves as a cornerstone metric with profound and wide-ranging significance. Despite the challenges China's economy has faced in recent years, it is projected to contribute about 30 percent of global economic growth in 2024, making it the largest source of growth for the world economy. INCREMENTAL POLICIES To achieve its growth target, China will roll out more targeted policies to stimulate economic activity. The government work report is expected to announce policy measures to ensure the goal is met. China has already signaled a shift in its macroeconomic stance. At the Central Economic Work Conference last December, policymakers pledged to roll out more proactive macro policies in 2025. Notably, they decided to adopt a ""moderately loose"" monetary policy, marking a significant departure from the ""prudent"" approach over the past 14 years. The meeting outlined nine key priorities, with boosting consumption at the forefront. This reflects China's emphasis on domestic demand as a top economic priority. In 2025, large-scale equipment upgrades and consumer goods trade-in programs are expected to be promoted with greater intensity and in a broader scope. According to Finance Minister Lan Fo'an, China in 2025 will actively use the room for a higher deficit, increase the issuance of local government special-purpose bonds, continue to issue ultra-long special treasury bonds, and increase transfer payments from the central government to local governments. The specifics of these plans will also be a key focus of this year's ""two sessions."" INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LEADERS, LEGISLATORS, ADVISORS During the ""two sessions,"" Chinese leaders, who are NPC deputies themselves, will interact with their fellow lawmakers at group deliberations. They will also interact with political advisors to discuss hotspot topics that matter most to state governance. These interactions serve as a window for observing how the central leadership stays informed about grassroots realities. This is a defining feature of Chinese democracy, often described in contemporary discourse as whole-process people's democracy. In recent years, President Xi Jinping, a deputy of Jiangsu Province's delegation to the 14th NPC, has typically participated in the delegation's deliberations. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, also attended the meetings of the NPC delegation of the armed forces and joined group discussions of political advisors from various sectors. During these interactions, Xi emphasized key priorities such as supporting the growth of the private sector and private enterprises, accelerating digital economy development, and advancing high-level opening-up -- all crucial to China's economic and social progress. FOREIGN POLICY The ""two sessions"" also shed light on China's foreign policy, as the foreign minister typically holds a press conference on the sidelines of the meetings. Last year, Foreign Minister Wang Yi answered 21 questions during a 90-minute press conference, with journalists from across the world participating. The foreign minister touched on various regional and international hotspot issues, such as the Ukraine crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He also expounded on China's foreign policies toward Russia, the United States, Europe, and Global South countries. During this year's ""two sessions,"" China's propositions on international relations are particularly noteworthy against the backdrop of a rapidly changing and turbulent global landscape. AI, INNOVATION Without a doubt, technological innovation will be a key focus during this year's ""two sessions,"" with the artificial intelligence (AI) industry very likely to take center stage. Over the past month, Chinese tech start-up DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the global AI industry and capital markets by introducing an open-source and popular chatbot. Domestically, companies such as Tencent, Baidu, and BYD have begun integrating DeepSeek into their products. Some local governments have also announced collaborations with the DeepSeek AI model to enhance public services, while others have organized training sessions to help officials and business professionals better understand the development and applications of DeepSeek and other AI technologies. In fact, AI has already emerged as one of the hottest topics at many of this year's provincial-level ""two sessions."" Many AI-related plans mentioned in provincial government work reports focus on building innovation platforms, promoting deeper industry integration, and improving policy frameworks. It's important to note that the rise of innovations like DeepSeek reflects China's commitment to taking the lead in technological advancements and its broader strategic focus on talent cultivation, innovation-friendly environment, business environment improvements, and the nurturing of non-public investments. These elements are expected to be underscored during the ""two sessions."" Additionally, the sessions provide a crucial platform for lawmakers and political advisors to offer suggestions and foster broad consensus on national development. Some of them are corporate executives and leading researchers. What AI-related proposals and suggestions they will present will be a major point of interest for China watchers.",Things to watch at China's 2025 'two sessions',Xinhua,english.www.gov.cn,,3/1/25 20:58,gemini-2.0-flash

Un tercer vuelo con 242 migrantes venezolanos, el primero con mujeres y niños, llegó a Caracas este lunes en un avión de la aerolínea estatal de Venezuela procedente de México, tras las conversaciones entre el gobierno de Nicolás Maduro y la administración del presidente Donald Trump. El ministro venezolano de Interior y Justicia, Diosdado Cabello, indicó que desconocen si el grupo fue enviado desde EEUU a territorio mexicano o si se encontraban ya allí. Precisó que está conformado por 94 hombres, 74 mujeres y 74 menores de edad, entre ellos una adolescente de 16 años sin acompañante. Cabello especificó que muchos de los menores llegaron sin ""ningún tipo de identificación"" venezolana porque nacieron en el exterior ""y no han sido registrados"" en el país, aseguró. Todos, agregó, serán sometidos a exámenes médicos y psicológicos. También recibirán los documentos de identidad que correspondan. El funcionario subrayó que todavía quedan muchos niños solos en el exterior y que sólo trajeron a una menor de edad sin representantes porque su padre aseguró que la buscaría en el aeropuerto. “Luego viene la revisión del expediente policial de cada uno de los adultos. Esto lo hacemos con una rigurosidad necesaria porque la primera información es que desde Estados Unidos venían delincuentes de todo tipo y cuando llegamos aquí la realidad no es esa, la realidad es que son una minoría”, dijo el ministro venezolano de Interior y Justicia antes de recibir a los recién llegados en el Aeropuerto Internacional Simón Bolívar. Cabello insistió en que ninguno de los venezolanos que han regresado tiene vínculos con la banda criminal Tren de Aragua, que el gobierno del país suramericano asegura haber desmantelado. De acuerdo con el ministro, es posible que esta semana llegue otro vuelo con repatriados. El 10 de febrero, fue trasladado a Venezuela un primer grupo de 190 migrantes irregulares venezolanos deportados desde Estados Unidos. El jueves de la semana pasada llegaron 177 migrantes venezolanos que estaban detenidos en la base naval de Guantánamo. En este caso, Cabello precisó que 8 de ellos están a la orden de la justicia por delitos “graves”, específicamente homicidio. Los vuelos de repatriación reiniciaron 10 días después de un encuentro en Caracas entre el gobernante Nicolás Maduro y Richard Grenell, enviado especial del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump. En esa reunión, según se anunció, Venezuela aceptó recibir a todos los inmigrantes irregulares venezolanos capturados en Estados Unidos.

https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-usmca-deal-tariff-deadline-monday-mananera-recap/,"United States President Donald Trump said Monday that his planned 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian exports to the U.S. “are going ahead on time, on schedule,” meaning the duties would take effect on March 4 at the conclusion of a one-month suspension.

“This is an abuse that took place for many, many years,” Trump said in justification of the decision to impose tariffs on the United States’ neighbors and North American trade partners.



— Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) February 24, 2025


“And I’m not even blaming the other countries that did this, I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen. I mean who can blame them if they made these great deals with the United States, took advantage of the United States on manufacturing, on just about everything,” he said at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Earlier on Monday, President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed confidence that Mexico would in fact reach an agreement with the United States to stave off Trump’s proposed tariffs for a second time.



At her morning press conference, Sheinbaum also spoke about the possibility of Mexico imposing additional tariffs on imports from countries with which it doesn’t have free trade agreements, most notably China.

‘If necessary,’ Sheinbaum will seek call with Trump

Trump has said he plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for three reasons:

Undocumented migrants have “poured into” the U.S. from Mexico and Canada.
Large quantities of drugs, including fentanyl, have entered the U.S. from its southern and northern neighbors.
The United States has large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada.

On Monday, Sheinbaum reiterated Mexico’s commitment to “helping the United States” solve the “humanitarian crisis” caused by illicit fentanyl in the U.S.

On actions to combat drug trafficking and other problems Mexico will need to reach “important agreements” with the United States this Friday, she said, noting that the tariffs are scheduled to take effect early next week.



“If it is necessary I will be seeking another telephone call with President Trump — whatever is needed to reach an agreement,” Sheinbaum said.

She noted that Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard traveled to Washington for tariff talks last week, and declared there is communication between Mexico and the United States “on all issues.”

“What we need is to close this agreement” to ward off the tariffs,” said Sheinbaum, who earlier this month achieved a one-month pause on the proposed duties after agreeing to deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to Mexico’s northern border.

“… I believe we’re in a position to do so,” she said.

Ebrard has said that the United States would be shooting itself in the foot if it imposes a 25% tariff on Mexican exports, asserting that 400,000 jobs would be lost in the U.S. and prices would rise for U.S. consumers.

He said earlier this month that 25% tariffs the United States intends to impose on all steel and aluminum imports are illogical and a “bad idea” with regard to Mexico, given that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Mexico on the trade of those metals. The steel and aluminum tariffs are scheduled to take effect on March 12.

USMCA the priority, says Sheinbaum, and therefore additional tariffs on China are an option

Sheinbaum noted that an Economy Ministry team is still in Washington as Mexico seeks to reach a new deal to stop Trump’s proposed tariffs taking effect next week.

“What we’ve established — I’ve said it from the beginning — is that the relationship and trade agreement with the United States has to be prioritized,” she said.

After observing the national holiday Flag Day, Sheinbaum discussed her efforts to avert tariffs and the importance of the USMCA free trade deal. (Presidencia)

“And we ask the United States to prioritize its trade agreement with Mexico and Canada,” Sheinbaum said.

She said that imposing tariffs on imports from countries with which Mexico doesn’t have free trade agreements, such as China, is an option.

“[Former] president López Obrador even did it, he put tariffs on countries with which we don’t have trade agreements,” said Sheinbaum, whose administration recently imposed tariffs on Chinese clothing and textiles.

“… With China, for example, we don’t have a trade agreement. … So it’s part of what this [Economy Ministry] group is working on,” she said, alluding to additional tariffs on Chinese exports to Mexico.

Bloomberg, citing “people familiar with the matter,” reported on Saturday that “the Trump administration told Mexican officials” including Minister Ebrard “that they should put their own duties on Chinese imports as part of their efforts to avoid tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.”

However, Sheinbaum said that the implementation of tariffs on Chinese exports to Mexico wasn’t a “condition” that had been set by the United States.

Implementing tariffs on countries with which Mexico doesn’t have a free trade deal — like China — is an option on the table, Sheinbaum said Monday. (Asipona Manzanillo)

“The issue is to reach an agreement that allows us … to guarantee that there are no tariffs between our countries [and] that the trade agreement continues,” she said.

“… [We have to] give priority to this trade agreement and see how the three [USMCA] countries can strengthen ourselves compared to other regions of the world,” Sheinbaum said.

“… In that sense, we’re not suggesting [tariffs] in particular on China, but rather on those countries with which we don’t have trade agreements,” she said.

“It’s something that I even put forward in the conversation I had with the president of China at the G20 [Summit in Brazil]. Of course with China there is a cultural relationship, … and [a relationship spanning] many other issues. On the issue of trade I told [President Xi Jinping] that we have the trade agreement with the United States and that is one of our priorities,” Sheinbaum said.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/20/ai-economy-undersea-cables-international-data-infrastructure/,"The artificial intelligence-powered economy has a massive vulnerability: the ocean. The digital world is connected by subsea cables, a roughly 750,000-mile network that could circle the globe 30 times. Laid as deep as five miles below the surface, these cords make daily life—and the global marketplace—possible. While 80 percent of international trade by volume is transported on the sea’s surface, 95 percent of international data flows under it, including instant messages, an estimated $10 trillion in daily financial transactions, and countries’ national-security secrets. Meanwhile, power generated offshore, a growing share of global energy, is often transported via subsea cables. These two elements—data and power—are the foundations of the AI economy. But the subsea cables through which they flow face escalating dangers, and multiple incidents in the past few months have highlighted those risks. In November, a Chinese vessel reportedly dragged its anchor along the Baltic seabed for more than 100 miles, severing data cables between Sweden and Lithuania as well as between Finland and Germany. NATO ships had to intervene. A month later, a Russian oil tanker believed to be part of Moscow’s “ghost fleet” cut a cable carrying power between Finland and Estonia, only to be seized by Finnish authorities. The German foreign minister called these incidents a “wake-up call” for Europe. NATO has since established a new mission in the Baltic to protect undersea infrastructure. But the challenge is global and persistent—in a sign of the heightened tempo of such incidents, another undersea cable—located to the north of Taiwan, which is connected to the outside digital world through just 15 cables—was damaged in early January, potentially by a Chinese ship. Shortly after, two cables to the Taiwan-governed Matsu Islands disconnected due to what Taiwan’s Digital Affairs Ministry called “natural deterioration,” though backup microwave communications were activated to keep the islands’ 14,000 residents online. In some cases, disruptions are accidental. Backup systems can often limit the negative effects, as they did during the most recent Matsu incident. However, whatever their causes, the consequences of the approximately 150 cable-breaking incidents a year can often be severe, and include internet shutdowns, espionage, and costly repairs and delays. In one dire incident in 2008, the severing of two Mediterranean cables shut down internet access in 14 countries, including 100 percent of connections in the Maldives, and 82 percent in India. What makes today’s risks even more vexing than they were then are questions of scale and significance. One-off cable cuts are relatively straightforward to fix. But if cables are damaged at particularly sensitive times or places, or on a wider geographic scale, then that task is much more challenging. Meanwhile, subsea cables are growing even more necessary to daily life as artificial intelligence increases demands for global data transmission, including through overseas data centers connected to the global cable networks. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being invested in AI infrastructure every year. But that infrastructure is often connected through one of the thinnest, and potentially most vulnerable, physical networks on the planet. The individual fiber optic strands that, combined, make up the subsea cables through which world’s information flows are often barely thicker than a human hair. And that delicate infrastructure predates the digital age. The first undersea cables made trans-Atlantic telegraph communication possible in the 1850s, and through the technological revolutions since, they’ve connected telephones, modern telecommunications devices, and now the global AI infrastructure. In recent decades, three main players, analogous to national champions, have dominated the global subsea cable market: SubCom in the United States, NEC Corporation in Japan, and Alcatel Submarine Networks in France. As of 2021, these three companies held a 87 percent global market share. However, in recent years, China has disrupted the subsea cable ecosystem. Huawei Marine Networks was founded in 2008, and it soon became the fastest-growing subsea cable provider and the fourth-largest in the industry. From 2018 to 2022, HMN Tech, as it was renamed in the intervening years, supplied 18 percent of new cables based on total length. The company’s success followed the playbook of many Chinese technology champions, with subsidies from the Chinese government allowing it to submit lower bids on projects than free-market competitors. The latest, and perhaps most consequential, market shift in the industry is happening now: the proliferation of artificial intelligence. As data has become the foundation for both the digital economy and the emerging AI industry over the past decade, hyperscalers—or large computing and cloud services providers such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon—have become major players in the subsea cable market. Most cables are now built by consortiums of hyperscaler and telecommunication companies. As technology companies build up their cloud and AI capabilities and construct more data centers globally, they also invest in more subsea cables. Today, Google is a part or sole owner of roughly 33 cables. Even in a stable international environment, it would be impossible to separate subsea cables from geopolitics. There are always risks of sabotage or espionage and the need to adapt to national and international standards-setting. Every international cable project needs government approvals along its routes. But in a more competitive—even combative—period in global affairs, the subsea cable market has become a more contested arena. In 2023, FP columnist Elizabeth Braw argued that we are “entering the era of the undersea Iron Curtain.” The public debut of ChatGPT in late 2022 and the proliferation of AI-enabled tools since have brought this 20th-century division into a new period in the history of technology. Because of the rise of AI, these cables are more important than they were even two years ago. The contest over subsea cables entails old tools of statecraft, such as deterrence and incentives, deployed in new domains. And in recent years, that contest has played out in every major geopolitical theater, affecting global consumers and many of the world’s leading companies. In Europe, a Chinese-flagged ship is suspected of having damaged a Baltic subsea cable in October 2023, a year before the Baltic Sea sabotage that triggered a NATO response a few weeks ago. In another incident earlier in 2023, another Chinese-flagged vessel reportedly damaged the cables connecting Taiwan with its aforementioned outlying Matsu Islands, leaving them without internet for weeks. And the warning signs flashed even brighter in 2024. Early last year in the Middle East, three cables in the Red Sea—where 90 percent of Europe-Asia communication flows—were damaged when the anchor of a commercial ship sunk by Houthi missiles dragged along the ocean floor. And U.S. officials told CNN last fall that Russia is developing a deep sea-focused military unit, a capability that could give Moscow new tools for aggression and gray-zone operations and attacks that fall short of war. The United States’ concern about subsea cables is growing and bipartisan. In 2019, worried about China’s civil-military fusion, espionage, and cyberthreats, the first Trump administration sanctioned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. The Trump era’s State Department’s multilateral Clean Network initiative included a “Clean Cable” pillar “to ensure undersea cables connecting [the U.S.] to the global internet are not subverted for intelligence gathering by the [People’s Republic of China] at hyper scale.” In 2024, under the Biden administration, the State Department built on those initiatives released the “New York Joint Statement on the Security and Resilience of Undersea Cables,” a set of principles endorsed by 30 countries at the United Nations General Assembly. The United States is also a member of the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience, announced in 2023. As world powers vie for regional influence and partnerships, subsea cable infrastructure contracts have become commercial contests for spheres of geopolitical influence. In 2021, HMN Tech was pushed out of a project linking three Pacific islands, including the Federated States of Micronesia, which has a defense agreement with the United States. The project was scrapped and later replaced by the East Micronesia Cable project, jointly funded by the United States, Australia, and Japan. Meanwhile, Vietnam—which has five aging subsea cables—is upgrading its infrastructure, creating a new opening for international ties. U.S. officials and telecommunications companies have held multiple meetings with Vietnamese officials to dissuade them from using geopolitically problematic companies, with officials reportedly pointing out that the choice of infrastructure providers could make Vietnam more or less attractive for international investment. For many countries, physical connections to Chinese cables are viewed as vulnerabilities. The United States government in 2020 set up Team Telecom, an interagency group tasked with safeguarding United States telecommunications infrastructure and preventing direct cable connections between the U.S. and mainland China or Hong Kong. Team Telecom recommended that the Federal Communications Commission block the Hong Kong segment of four planned subsea cable routes. The project owners of these cables, both hyperscalers, switched their termination points to the Philippines and Taiwan, rather than Hong Kong, at an estimated cost of tens of millions of dollars. The contest over subsea cables isn’t just playing out in foreign ministries—it’s also altering how companies are governed and how the world is wired. Due in part to U.S. pressure, Huawei divested from Huawei Marine Networks in 2020, when the company rebranded to HMN Tech. More significantly than a change in name or structure, other companies have been squeezed out of projects since then. The SeaMeWe-6 cable, now under construction, will connect more than a dozen countries across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe. HMN Tech was poised to win the contract in 2020 with a bid that was approximately one-third lower than competitors’, but the United States offered five foreign telecom companies training grants worth a total of $3.8 million if they selected SubCom instead, while warning consortium members of potential sanctions against HMN Tech. SubCom ultimately won the SeaMeWe-6 contract, and Chinese companies left the consortium, to be replaced by enterprises from Malaysia and Indonesia. The results of such commercial and diplomatic maneuvering are clear: Chinese companies are losing ground in international markets. There are now only three new cables with connections in Hong Kong scheduled for 2025, and none after. For comparison, Singapore, historically a smaller market competitor than Hong Kong, has 26 subsea cables landing at three landing sites, with plans to double the number of sites by 2033. Under the sea as well as over it, the world is becoming more divided. The geography of subsea connections mirrors geopolitical divides. Rather than transiting the contested South China Sea, for example, Western consortiums now often pursue less direct avenues, such as through the Java Sea. They cover a greater distance at greater cost, but with less geopolitical risk. Guam, Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore may stand to benefit from new routes, especially as they become greater data center hubs. Meanwhile, China has increased its push for new subsea cable projects to the global south and parts of the world that are tied to its Digital Silk Road initiative, where Western interests hold less sway. A world divided into blocs by digital infrastructure may be more resilient, but security doesn’t come without trade-offs. At $40,000 to $60,000 per kilometer, cables are expensive to lay, and once they’re set and connected to facilities like data centers, they cannot be easily ripped out and replaced. Delayed, canceled, or rerouted subsea cables add uncertainty, complicating market dynamics. Longer cables laid over less efficient routes also mean more latency, as data must travel greater distances. And while casual internet users may not recognize slower speeds, quick data transfer time is critical across many industries—even milliseconds matter when it comes to executing financial transactions, let alone in military applications. In the competition over subsea cables, countries can work to increase the security of their infrastructure, but it’s not clear what victory looks like. When it comes to AI, the United States has aimed to keep and develop what former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan described as “as large a lead as possible,” especially in advanced logic and memory chips, with chip export controls and other measures in place to impede competitors’ progress. But despite the differences in products made by each enterprise, Chinese companies and the Chinese government have largely achieved self-reliance in subsea cables, with capabilities comparable to Western alternatives. That means that export controls alone can’t ensure Western advantage. While Beijing’s access to international markets has been curtailed, China possesses the technology and capabilities across the stack to manufacture all components of subsea cables at home. China also has a history of pouring heavy subsidies into the cable industry, a trend that carries across other industries from solar power to electric vehicles, and that gives it asymmetric advantages that distort markets. As a result, despite pressure, HMN Tech remains competitive, can offer lower prices, and is planning to build its own $500 million Europe-Middle East-Asia cable, a rival to the SeaMeWe-6 cable. China also has a strong foothold in cable maintenance and repair, which are critical and complex components of the infrastructure’s life cycle. The cable maintenance industry divides the ocean into zones, with certain repair ships designated to cover each. As a result, U.S.-owned cables may rely on Chinese repair ships in certain places, which could make them vulnerable to spyware, whatever their ownership. In one concerning incident, a Chinese repair company that worked on cables owned by U.S. hyperscalers appeared to hide its vessels’ locations near Taiwan and Indonesia, according to shipping data reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. This unusual and unexplained behavior raised alarm about what the vessel was doing and where it was doing it. And repairs are even more complicated and costly in conflict zones, such as during the clashes in the Red Sea last year. Even in the absence of conflict, competing claims to vital sea lanes can distort the subsea cable market. While the United States has exerted pressure to push Chinese companies out of certain projects, China has gone further, delaying or blocking permits for cables with U.S. involvement, including in the South China Sea. The rising risks to subsea cable networks are connected to crises above the surface. The Iranian-backed Houthi attacks on international shipping have damaged undersea cables in the Red Sea. Taiwan’s subsea connections are potential targets in coercion campaigns against the island. And even if Western Europe isn’t yet directly engaged in a military conflict with Moscow, its infrastructure is under threat by an expansionist Russia—and NATO is responding to that very real threat. Rather than wait for something to happen, there are proactive strategies to protect subsea cables and deter bad actors. Enhanced coordination in monitoring and management of the seas can help. Such measures may include increased patrols as well as potentially boarding and inspecting suspicious vessels, particularly in shallow areas with significant concentrations of cables. This approach could deter attacks and improve attribution when they do occur. Meanwhile, AI itself may solve some of subsea cables’ greatest vulnerabilities. The Wall Street Journal reports that AI-enabled underwater systems such as drones are already being used to identify and combat threats, even at the bottom of the ocean. Where such forward defenses don’t succeed and cable repairs need to be made, especially in contested waters, partners can protect repair ships in the short term and prevent and eliminate threats as they arise. Increased redundancy in sensitive areas, combined with more ex-China repair capacity, including expanding their fleets of cable-laying ships, could decrease downtimes and build on Washington’s Cable Security Program, which authorized and subsidized U.S. repair ships. Meanwhile, streamlined permitting processes could speed up repairs and build-outs, which once took under 12 months, but can now last for more than three years because of a complex regulatory environment that requires engagement with multiple levels of government, often with uncertain and competing priorities. An improved regulatory environment can also speed up innovation, which may help build more resilient, diversified cable networks. In the next few years, alternatives to subsea cables—such as satellites and other space-based systems such as satellites in low-earth orbit—have shown promise, though they currently have less capacity than subsea cable networks and are still vulnerable to natural and humanmade disasters. Still, such options, bolstered by a growing private-sector space industry, may provide new data transmission options and backups in certain sectors. Indeed, a NATO-funded project launched in July 2024 aims to reroute more internet traffic to space, in case of infrastructure disruptions on Earth. And when the two subsea cables connecting Taiwan with the Matsu Islands were disconnected in January, the backup microwave systems were activated almost instantly. Still, such measures currently provide only limited bandwidth. That may suffice for a country’s sparsely populated outlying islands, but it would likely fall short in urban areas or when it comes to high-volume, low-latency data centers. There is no comprehensive backup for the world’s subsea cable networks. But the seabed, like the surface, is not as peaceful as it once was. A lesson of the 2020s so far has been that when deterrence—whether by denial, punishment, or entanglement—fails in one domain, it can soon collapse elsewhere. That’s also true beneath the waves.",The AI Economy’s Massive Vulnerability,Jared Cohen,Foreign Policy,2025-02-20T06:00:46-05:00,2025-02-20T16:37:08-05:00,gemini-2.0-flash

Multiple agencies responded with Bonneville County Sheriff’s Deputies to the Ririe Reservoir this afternoon at approximately 4:40pm to a report of a Helicopter crash on the ice. First responders deployed on snow machines from the Juniper Campground area, locating the crash site more than a mile east of the dam and two occupants who were inside.  One occupant was deceased at the scene and a second was transported back to an awaiting ambulance before being taken to the hospital for non-life threatening injuries. Deputies located a downed power line in the area of the crash as well. 

After both patients were removed from the ice, Deputies secured the area for continued investigation and notified the FAA and NTSB. Rescue personnel and resources from Idaho Falls Fire, Jefferson Central Fire, Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, and the Idaho Fish and Game also responded to the scene. Additional personnel from Bonneville County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue, Dive Rescue and Drone Teams responded as well as the Bonneville County Coroner’s Office. 

Deputies have closed Ririe Reservoir and the area around the crash site for safety due to downed power lines and unstable ice conditions. The circumstances of why the helicopter was in that area are still being confirmed and the investigation is continuing. 

No further information is available at this time. 

UPDATED:

RIRIE, Idaho (KIFI) — According to the Bonneville County Sheriff's Office, Emergency personnel are on the scene of a single helicopter crash at Ririe Reservoir east of Idaho Falls. First responders have located the crash, about halfway between Ririe Dam and the Blacktail Access area. 

""The helicopter was located, on the ice of the reservoir. It appears that a power line is down."" Sgt. Bryan Lovell of the Bonneville County Sheriff's Office told Local News 8. ""There's only one spot that a big power line goes across, and so whether that's a factor in it [the crash] or not, we're still trying to determine.""

Rescue efforts are currently under way with multiple agencies assisting to coordinate the operation safely. Bonneville County Sheriff’s Deputies, Search and Rescue, Idaho Fish and Game, Jefferson Central Fire, and Idaho Falls Fire are among the resources on the scene. 

Sgt. Lovell has confirmed there are two people in the helicopter and crews are in the process of getting those two people out and back to shore safely. Local News 8 cannot confirm the condition of the helicopter passengers at this time.

""where the helicopter hit the ice it might weaken it or it might be partially submerged,"" said Lovell. And so we have dive teams, rescue teams, and our search and rescue crew up here.""

Sgt. Lovell tells Local News 8 it is too soon to determine the cause of the crash. Bonneville Search and Rescue along with area partners will contact the FAA and the National Highway Transportation Board to assist in the investigation. 

""The priority right now is making sure we get everybody in a safe place and off the ice,"" said Lovell. ""Out of any potential harm's way especially as it gets dark right now.""

Local News 8 will update this story as more information becomes available.

https://balkaninsight.com/2025/02/20/montenegro-parliament-to-probe-decades-of-attacks-on-journalists/,"Montenegro’s parliament voted on Thursday to open an investigation and form an Inquiry Committee into the role of state authorities in politically-motivated murders and attacks on journalists since the 1990s. Explaining the proposal, speaker Andrija Mandic said the time had come for society to face the dark legacy of unsolved murders, beatings and grave crimes, which, he said, were almost a daily occurrence under the former Democratic Party of Socialists, DPS administration. “A country where the chief special prosecutors are forced to work not for the state but for the most monstrous criminal clans, a country where the directors of the police were the most loyal ministers of the former president could not possibly be a country that fights against crime. It was a country held hostage by crime,” Mandic said. “It’s time to say enough. And we are doing that. We have to show the world what a wicked system it was. That’s why we need the Inquiry Committee, because we have to expose the dark past and cleanse the tainted justice system of shame and restore dignity to Montenegro,” he added. The session was not attended by opposition MPs who have been boycotting parliament since mid-December after the ruling majority terminated the mandate of a Constitutional Court judge who had hit retirement age. Members of the ruling majority stated before that it is crucial that parliament gathers all the information about the cases that will be dealt with by the inquiry. One was the attack on the journalist Mladen Stojovic who was beaten in his home in the town of Bar in 2008. The attack came after he talked about the fixing of football match results by a “football mafia” in the documentary-investigative series Insider,which was then broadcast on Belgrade’s B 92 TV. In the series, he talked about the controversial businessman Branislav Micunovic, who died in 2024, as well as football manager Radojica Bozovic. A year before his death, Micunovic was placed on a US sanctions list as a leading figure in organised crime in Montenegro. The case of the attack expired in 2018 and neither the attackers nor the perpetrators were ever discovered. Micunovic and Bozovic were questioned two months before the case expired but repeated that they had nothing to do with it. Stojovic said the investigating authorities did not do their work, which is why an Inquiry Committee is needed. “The investigative authorities obstructed the investigation,” Stojovic told BIRN. He added that he did not expect the case to be solved because some of those involved are no longer alive, but some answers could yet be found. The Inquiry Committee will also deal with the murder of the owner and editor of the newspaperDan,Dusko Jovanovic, who was killed in 2004 in front of his editorial office. Although governments have changed in Montenegro since then, the motive for the murder has remained unknown, as have the identities of those who ordered it. The DPS, under whose rule the murder took place, lost power after three decades in 2020. The new authorities promised to clarify all the facts about Jovanovic’s murder but this has not yet happened. In addition tonumerous attacks on journalists, the committee will also investigate cases of attacks on intellectuals and others who opposed the former government. The DPS and part of the opposition previously opposed the formation of an Inquiry Committee, stating that the procedures were being violated.",Montenegro Parliament to Probe Decades of Attacks on Journalists,Borislav Visnjic,Balkan Insight,2025-02-20T16:43:08,2025-02-20T16:43:50,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2025/february/name-1041143-en.html,"RICHMOND, VA – Governor Glenn Youngkin announced today that he submitted an Expedited Major Disaster Declaration to President Donald J. Trump to support the ongoing response and recovery efforts of communities impacted by the recent winter storms.

“Over the past week, the Commonwealth has been hit extremely hard, particularly in areas that are still recovering from Hurricane Helene,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “This is the fifth major flood in this area in the past five years and there is significant damage that is affecting community lifelines. It is critical that we provide relief, and we will certainly take every measure possible to ensure that these areas are able to make a full recovery as quickly as possible. I want to thank our state and local agencies, and our federal, state and local elected officials for the incredible collaboration, and our first responders who have courageously made more than 150 swift water rescues and facilitated emergency operations that have saved lives throughout these storms.”

As the winter storms and flooding moved in, over seven inches of rain fell in some areas of Southwest Virginia with significant life-threatening flash flooding across Virginia’s most vulnerable and least resourced areas, resulting in historic river crests on the James River and other major waterways that have not been seen in the commonwealth since 1977. This resulted in critical infrastructure damages, over 203,000 customers without power at its peak, over 270 road closures including low water bridge and road washouts, and 9-1-1 center outages. The towns of Grundy and Hurley (Buchanan County) have experienced catastrophic flooding, with the river gauges in these towns spiking historical flood levels. Throughout the regions, over 150 swift water rescues, including evacuations, were made on Sunday, February 16. Support efforts continue as high water is blocking access to critical facilities, and access to the hardest hit areas is not yet available due to receding water and debris.

PERSONAL PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS

As communities continue to face flooding concerns, below are some flood safety and preparedness tips.

Failing to evacuate flooded areas, entering flood waters, or remaining after a flood has passed can result in injury or death. Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States.


	Remember that flash floods can come with no warning. They can cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings, and create landslides.

	Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown!

	Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.

	Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.

	Stay away from downed wires and do not approach or touch trees or limbs that are entangled with wires as they could be extremely dangerous. If those are in state maintained roadways, VDOT crews must await the power company to remove any electrical hazard before addressing downed trees or other roadway debris.

	Power outages are affecting traffic signals in some areas. Treat all inoperable traffic signals as four-way stops.

	For questions or to report hazardous road conditions such as flooding or downed trees and powerlines, contact VDOT’s 24-hour Customer Service Center by visiting	my.vdot.virginia.govor calling 800-FOR-ROAD (367-7623).

	Check roadway conditions by using VDOT’s free 511 mobile app, which offers information about road conditions, traffic, incidents, construction and congestion as well as access to traffic cameras, weather and more. Information is also available at 511.vdot.virginia.gov or by calling 511 while in Virginia.

	Visit VDOT’s Districts webpage for more details in your area.

	Determine how best to protect yourself based on the type of flooding.

		Evacuate if told to do so.

		Move to higher ground or a higher floor.

		Stay where you are.



How to prepare for flooding:


	Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts.

	If flash flooding is a risk in your location, then monitor potential signs, such as heavy rain.

	Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response.

	Gather supplies in case you have to leave immediately, or if services are cut off. Keep in mind each person’s specific needs, including medication. Don’t forget the needs of pets. Obtain extra batteries and charging devices for phones and other critical equipment.

	Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies.

	Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters.



What to do during a flood:


	Depending on where you are, and the impact and the warning time of flooding, go to the safe location that you previously identified.

	If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Never drive around barricades. Local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of flooded areas.

	Listen to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions.

	Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown!

	Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning.

	If your vehicle is trapped in rapidly moving water, then stay inside. If water is rising inside the vehicle, then seek refuge on the roof.

	If trapped in a building, then go to its highest level. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising floodwater. Go on the roof only if necessary. Once there, signal for help.



Be safe after a flood:


	Listen to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.

	Avoid driving, except in emergencies.

	Wear heavy gloves and boots during clean up.

	Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off the electricity to prevent electric shock.

	Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris and be contaminated. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.

	Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.



Cleaning up from a flood:


	Personal safety is always the highest priority when entering buildings damaged by floodwater.

	Check for structural damage before re-entering your home to avoid being trapped in a building collapse.

	Keep power off until an electrician has inspected your system for safety.

	Turn off the gas. Be alert for gas leaks.

	Look before you step. After a flood, the ground and floors are covered with debris, including broken bottles and nails. Floors and stairs that have been covered with mud can be very slippery.

	Take photos of any floodwater in your home and of damaged items for insurance purposes.

	Rescue the most valuable items but never attempt to salvage belongings at the expense of your own safety.

	Wear long sleeves, sturdy shoes or waterproof boots, and plastic or rubber gloves during cleanup.

	Wash your hands often with soap and clean water or use a hand-cleaning gel with alcohol in it.

	Mold can form within 48 hours; you will need to work fast. If you do encounter extensive mold, use protective gear such as gloves, goggles, and an N95 or N100 face mask, available at most hardware stores.

	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers guidelines for mold cleanup after floods.

	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a number of helpful resources, about hazards you may encounter when cleaning up inside and outside your home.



Emergency Alerts


	These days, emergency alerts can reach you in so many ways–WEA (Wireless Emergency Alerts) come to your cell phone, EAS (Emergency Alert System) on TV and Radio, NOAA weather radio alerts, mobile apps and more. It’s important to have several different ways you can receive emergency alerts, and to be armed with the knowledge you need before an emergency happens.

		Know the current forecast and get alerted for any watches, warnings, or advisories on the National Weather Service’s website

		Download FEMA app and local news apps for severe weather alerts

		Sign up to receive alerts on your phone, tune in to your local weather station, or listen to your NOAA Weather Radio

The heavy rain Saturday evening has caused a levee there to break, and floodwaters are pouring into the surrounding area. Emergency officials are calling it a life-threatening situation. ""It’s worse than I have seen it before. It’s truly a life-threatening event,"" Rives Fire Chief Campbell Rice said. The small-town community of Rives, Tenn., looks more like a lake as rising floodwaters swallow lawns and cars Sunday afternoon. ""We had the saturated ground, and the rivers were all full. And just all of a sudden we were inundated with water,"" Rice said. Obion County Mayor Steve Carr issued a mandatory evacuation for people living in Rives due to the rising water and no electricity. ""If anybody tries to stay there, they are not going to have any electricity or heat, and we are about to have subfreezing temperatures moving in tonight, so it is going to be a very dangerous situation,"" he said. Mayor Carr, made the declaration in a post to his Facebook page, saying: According to a post on their X page, the National Weather Service in Memphis said the levee near Rives in Obion County had failed Sunday morning, resulting in ""rapid onset flooding of the town of Rives and surrounding areas."" Water rescues are now underway as emergency crews take boats door to door. The Millington Fire Department said it sent a water rescue team of six people and equipment to Rives, adding that additional water rescue teams from Collierville, Tipton County and Madison County had been dispatched as well. ""Fire administration was notified at 7:30 this morning of extensive flooding in the area, and the request for water teams was issued,"" the department wrote in a post to X. ""The teams have arrived in the area and have boats in the water conducting recon missions of flooded properties in that community."" ""We did have some folks that have gotten cold and wet, and they’ve been taken to the hospital for treatment, but we’ve had no serious injuries or deaths, so we are thankful for that,"" Carr said.  As the county prepares to rebuild, more departments and people are stepping up to help. ""This is kind of what these guys do. They jump in and help other departments,"" Collierville Fire Chief John Selberg said. ""A lot of them are on their days off, and it's kind of nice because next time you’re going to be the one who needs it. So it is always nice to get out and help someone else."" They are closely monitoring the situation and stress the seriousness of the potential for further levee breakage, Mayor Carr said.  Mayor Carr, in a separate statement on the situation, said: Together, we will navigate through this crisis. Stay safe, stay informed, and look out for one another.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-943c9a5e-32c0-4eae-8abb-4d9c4c6eae1e,"President Donald Trump has made repeated claims that China “operates” the Panama Canal in recent weeks and has threatened to take back the waterway to block what he sees as Beijing’s increasing influence. A BBC Verify analysis shows that the US remains the main user of the canal, but Chinese involvement in infrastructure projects around the waterway - which is operated directly by Panama - has grown in recent years. Up to 14,000 ships use the 51-mile (82km) passage each year. It links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the Central American country, avoiding an otherwise lengthy and costly trip around South America. The waterway cuts the amount of time it takes goods to flow from Shenzhen in China to the US east coast, or between San Francisco and New York, by weeks. After Panama signed up to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2017 - where Beijing invests in infrastructure across the globe - Chinese companies were more active around the canal. Panama left the partnership earlier this month amid US pressure. However, much of Trump’s ire has been focused on Chinese control over ports which predate the BRI. There are five container ports around the Panama Canal. All of them are operated by foreign companies. Three of the canal’s main container ports - Colon, Rodman and Manzanillo - are operated by companies based in Singapore, Taiwan and the US. But much of the US attention has focused on the two biggest, Cristóbal and Balboa. They sit at either end of the canal and have been operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings since 1997. While the company is a private corporation based outside the Chinese mainland, experts have told the BBC that the Chinese national security law introduced in 2020 could allow China to exercise influence over Hong Kong-based companies in the event of a conflict. “In terms of the day-to-day, I’m sceptical as to whether there’s a direct line between Beijing and CK Hutchison, but in a time of a crisis or a conflict it would be relatively trivial for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to say we’re going to use the ports,” Henry Ziemer, an Americas specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told the BBC. This view was echoed by the former commander of the US military’s southern command, Gen Laura J Richardson. She told lawmakers in 2023 that “in any potential global conflict, the PRC [China] could leverage strategic regional ports to restrict US naval and commercial ship access”. The chairman of CK Hutchison - Victor Li Tzar-kuoi - serves as a member of the national committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), according to his company website. The CPPCC is China's top political advisory body comprising of thousands of members and is part of the “United Front System” which works to aid government influence domestically and abroad. Its members usually include top corporate figures. BBC Verify approached CK Hutchison Holdings for comment. While Trump’s attention has focused on Balboa and Cristóbal, Chinese companies have been involved in projects elsewhere around the canal - with one major bridge project attracting some attention. Three bridges currently cross the canal at various points. Slightly north of the Bridge of the Americas, a Chinese corporation is building the new Fourth Bridge, connecting Panama City to West Panama. This is the site in March 2024. The deal - which the Reuters news agency reported was worth about $1.42bn - has been beset by delays. But satellite images over the past year show development of the bridge has picked up, as seen here in January 2025. US officials have raised concerns over the involvement of Chinese firms in the project. Republican Senator Ted Cruz recently said that the “partially-completed bridge gives China the ability to block the canal without warning”, but did not elaborate as to how he thought the bridge could be used as an obstacle. Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama at the time, visits the site of the Fourth Bridge Project in 2019 Other major projects include the Amador Cruise Terminal built by the China Harbour Engineering Company on the Pacific side of the canal. And an extension to the Panama City Metro which will run under the south end of the canal is being built by the China Railway Tunnel Group Company. But while these projects represent some Chinese interests around the canal, Panamanian authorities have shelved several other high profile Chinese-led projects. Eddie Tapiero, a Panama-based economist, said he believed that around 50% of projects initiated after Panama joined the BRI have been discontinued or suspended. In 2022, a major project intended to develop a new port on Isla Margarita on the Caribbean side of the canal was cancelled. A proposed high-speed rail line across the country from Panama City to David in the west of the country was also shelved after a new government came to power in Panama. And a plan to build a new Chinese embassy on the Amador Causeway Islands - which sit at the gates of the canal - was cancelled in 2018. Experts who spoke to the BBC have suggested that China’s influence over infrastructure had mainly expanded to fill a gap left by the US in the region. Mr Tapiero told BBC Verify that US companies were frequently uninterested or uncompetitive in bidding processes compared to Chinese competitors - who he said were often willing to offer finance when seeking deals. Statistics for foreign direct investment (FDI) - the amount of money countries are investing in another country - paint a similar picture. China invested $1.4bn in Panama in 2023 - a fourfold increase since the start of the BRI in 2017 - while US investments, although far higher overall, have declined over that same period. Annual investment in Panama From October 2023 to September 2024, shipping to or from China accounted for 21% of the cargo going through the waterway according to figures from the Panama Canal management company. However, the US remains the biggest investor in Panama and the top user of the canal by some distance. Last year, three and half times as much cargo passed through the canal going to and from the US than China. Cargo via the Panama Canal, top 15 countries, Oct 2023 to Sep 2024 Beijing’s influence in Panama may well be on the decline, says Henry Ziemer of the CSIS. The Panamanian authorities have “had a taste of what infrastructure partnership with China looks like, and they are not too pleased with that. It hasn’t delivered the big flashy gains that were promised when they first signed onto the BRI.” “That is why - along with pressure from Washington - the sense is now that Panama is seeking to move away from China.”",Mapping China’s influence around the Panama Canal  - BBC News,"Matt Murphy, Jake Horton and Erwan Rivault",BBC News,2025-02-14T00:00:00,2025-02-14T00:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/02/13/why-are-we-handing-russia-what-it-wants-eus-chief-diplomat-blasts-us-over-ukraine-a87993,"BRUSSELS — The European Union’s top diplomat slammed U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration for sidelining Ukraine and engaging with Russia’s Vladimir Putin without consulting Kyiv or Europe. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told allies in Brussels on Wednesday that Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO and reclaim its 1991 borders as part of a peace settlement were “unrealistic.” He also said the U.S. would “no longer tolerate” European NATO members relying on Washington for security. The remarks, followed by a surprise phone call between Trump and Putin in which the two agreed to enter peace talks, have stunned European officials and raised concerns that Kyiv may be sidelined in discussions about its own future. “They [the U.S.] say that it’s not going to be NATO membership, but some other security guarantees. Then the questions need to be answered by everybody — what are these security guarantees, really?” said Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, ahead of a NATO defense ministers’ meeting. “Being in NATO, where we have these structures, is actually the best security guarantee,” she added. Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister known for her staunch support of Ukraine, condemned what she described as a reckless diplomatic maneuver that rewards Russian aggression before negotiations even begin. “We shouldn’t take anything off the table before negotiations start. It plays into Russia’s hands. And it is exactly what they want,” she said. “Why are we giving them everything they want even before negotiations begin? Appeasement has never worked.” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius echoed her concerns, warning against making public concessions ahead of talks. “In my view, it would have been better to discuss Ukraine’s possible NATO membership or the country’s possible loss of territory only at the negotiating table, not to rule it out beforehand,” Pistorius said in Brussels. Kallas stressed that any peace deal imposed without the consent of Ukraine and European allies was doomed to fail. “There’s an agreement being made behind our backs that simply will not work,” she said. “For any kind of agreement, you need Europeans to implement it, you need Ukrainians to implement it.”  “It doesn’t look good if somebody agrees on something and everybody else has to say, ‘OK, you have agreed, but we will not follow this.’ Ukrainians will resist, and we will support them,” Kallas added. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte took a more diplomatic tone, arguing that the statements from Trump and Hegseth merely underscored the need for dialogue within the alliance. “Secretary Hegseth’s comments, and what later emerged from Washington, were significant statements,” Rutte said.  “At the same time, this is how an alliance should function,” he said. “We are a coalition of democracies. We need to debate. But I see a clear convergence: we all want peace, we want it to be lasting and we must ensure Ukraine is in the strongest possible position.”  At the same time, Rutte noted that Europe “must also step up defense spending and industrial production.”  “On that, there is clear agreement,” he said.

El Paso's public bus fixed route transportation servicewill be running on a reduced Sunday/holiday schedule for a week starting on Wednesday, Feb. 12, due to the impact and damage from the two-alarm blaze at Sun Metro headquarters, city officials said. The fire — which was initially described as a vehicle explosion — started in a bus maintenance garage area around 1 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 11, at the Sun Metro Operations Center at 10151 Montana Ave. near Wedgewood Drive, El Paso Fire Department Assistant Chief Robert Arvizu said.  The two-alarm fire was knocked down by 4:40 p.m. Tuesday even as crews continued to check for hot spots and an investigation continued, the El Paso Fire Department said via the X platform. Five people were injured in the explosion, Arvizu said. Four people were taken to hospitals, while another declined to go to the hospital, officials said. One person suffered serious injuries and three people suffered minor injuries. Three other people declined to go to the hospital. About 48 fire units and more than 100 firefighters responded to the fire, Arvizu said. Fire severely damages El Paso Sun Metro bus facility The fire caused ""severe damage"" to the Sun Metro Operations Center, Arvizu said. ""The roof collapsed,"" Arvizu said. ""We had walls collapse but none of the firefighters were injured.” El Paso Fire Department officials are conducting an investigation into the fire, Arvizu said. El Paso police officers responded to the scene to assist the fire department with traffic control, including the closure of the normally busy Montana Avenue. Montana Avenue between Wedgewood and Yarbrough drives was closed to traffic for several hours. The closure was necessary because fire crews were using fire hydrants and water lines across the street. Firefighters in ladder trucks were working to extinguish the fire as a large plume of black smoke came from the Sun Metro Operations Center. The dark smoke plume could be seen for miles across El Paso. Additional fire trucks were still arriving at the scene as of 2 p.m. Firefighting efforts continued despite gusty winds and hazy skies before a dust storm blew into the city. El Paso city officials said details about the fire and its cause are limited, adding, ""our primary focus is on containing the fire and the safety of our staff.""

https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/australia-close-to-breaking-china-s-critical-mineral-stranglehold-20250205-p5l9ox.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_business,"Australian firms are edging closer to breaking China’s production stranglehold on the rare minerals used in the world’s critical defence systems, electric vehicles and clean energy transition. Companies like Iluka Resources, Lynas Rare Earths, and several lithium miners are already refining, or close to producing, the minerals needed for the batteries, electric circuitry and high-strength magnets that underpin the globe’s green energy transition. Light rare earth oxides, such as neodymium and praseodymium, are used in aircraft engines, electronics, wind turbines and electric vehicles. Heavy rare earths, like the dysprosium and terbium over which China has a stranglehold, are a crucial element in the permanent high-strength magnets used in robotics, defence technology and ocean wind turbines, where they require little maintenance to generate electricity far from the coastline. The minerals refined by Australian companies are now a strategic asset as America swings sharply towards a more transactional trade stance under US President Donald Trump, and Beijing counters US tariffs by clamping down on supply of scarce metals. If Australia is dragged into a trade war with the US and China, “heavy rare earths could serve as a bargaining chip,” said Neha Mukherjee, a senior analyst in rare earths at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Within hours of Trump imposing a 10 per cent tariff on China last week, Beijing introduced export controls on a raft of key minerals such as tungsten, tellurium, molybdenum, bismuth and indium that are critical to a range of high-tech goods. China’s Commerce Ministry said the controls were to “safeguard national security interests.” The clampdown exposes a fault line running through the global economy. China has invested heavily for decades in refining production of critical minerals and rare earths and accounts for 90 per cent of all rare earth oxides used in global manufacturing, effectively controlling all supply of key heavy rare earths. Governments around the world are scrambling to secure supplies of the key minerals as a result. “Rare earths are among very few metals where China has demonstrated a preparedness to withhold supply to achieve unrelated political or other objectives. We’ve also seen China previously implement restrictions on the export of rare earth processing technology,” Iluka managing director Tom O’Leary said. “We’ve all seen the perils of concentrated supply chain over the last several years, and so there’s much greater awareness now of the importance of security of supply,” O’Leary said. Iluka is building a fully integrated rare earths refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia with the help of a $1.65 billion federal government loan. Within a decade of firing up the plant in 2027, it will account for 10 per cent of the world’s rare earth oxide supply and refine more than a third of the globe’s strategically important heavy rare earth oxides, the company says. Meanwhile, ASX-listed Lynas – valued at $6.5 billion – late last year turned on production at its newly built $800 million mixed rare-earth processing plant in Kalgoorlie. It will ship the carbonate output from Kalgoorlie for further refining in Malaysia where it operates the world’s largest single rare earths processing plant producing separated rare earths for export. Lynas is also building a heavy rare earths refinery in Texas, backed by $384 million in Defence Department funding from the Biden administration, in a bid to accelerate America’s access to supplies of rare earths. Another Benchmark analyst, Cameron Perks, said if the US-China trade war escalates, combined with new tariffs and export controls, it’s going to have a significant impact on the critical minerals sector as a whole. “We’re seeing critical minerals being used more and more as bargaining chips in trade negotiations, with countries leveraging their control over supply chains to get a better deal,” Perks said. “Clients in South Korea and Japan have been reaching out to Australia a lot lately, wanting insights on supply, demand, pricing, and cost curves as they try to figure out the impact of Trump’s policies. They’re trying to figure out if this is an opportunity or if they should be backing out,” he said. Australia’s current heavy rare earth output accounts for just 1 per cent of global mined production, Mukherjee said. But it’s projected to jump significantly, reaching 14 per cent by 2029 – the fastest growth outside of China. Ramping up refining capacity is costly, technically challenging and time-consuming. Few have gained the foothold required to compete with China, even on more basic materials like lithium. ASX-listed IGO began producing battery-grade lithium hydroxide with joint venture partner China’s Tianqi Lithium from its Kwinana Refinery in Western Australia in 2022, only to shutter parts of the operation in January this year as sluggish demand for electric vehicles and slumping prices slowed sales and created a global stockpile of the white battery metal.",Australia close to breaking China’s critical mineral stranglehold,Simon Johanson,The Sydney Morning Herald,2025-02-09T05:00:00,2025-02-09T05:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.npr.org/2025/02/09/g-s1-47467/egypt-emergency-arab-summit,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Egypt announced Sunday it would host a summit of Arab leaders later in the month, amid alarm in the region over President Trump's proposals regarding the future of Gaza. A statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry says the summit is being called in response to a Palestinian request. It said the leaders will gather on Feb. 27 to discuss ""the new and dangerous developments in the Palestinian issue."" Also Sunday, Israeli forces began withdrawing from the Netzarim corridor in Gaza, in the latest stage of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The Netzarim corridor is a four mile strip of land bisecting northern and southern Gaza that Israel fortified during the war, using it as a military zone. Last month, as part of the ceasefire deal, Israel started allowing Palestinians to cross the Netzarim corridor and return to their homes in the North. The withdrawal is part of the six week first phase of the ceasefire, in which Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, while allowing aid to Gaza. In the next stage of the ceasefire, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and ""sustainable calm."" But negotiations are ongoing on the details. Israel wants Hamas' military and political capabilities eliminated, while Hamas wants all Israeli troops removed from Gaza. Egypt's announcement of a summit comes less than a week after many Arab states rejected Trump's recent comments about relocating Gaza's residents and creating a ""Riviera of the Middle East"" there, as have Palestinian leaders. Trump made the proposal Tuesday when he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington D.C. Speaking to reporters at the White House Friday, Trump said he viewed the proposal as ""a real estate transaction, where we'll be an investor in that part of the world."" He added that he was in ""no rush to do anything."" Several countries also condemned a suggestion by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — that Saudi Arabia has enough land for a Palestinian state. Netanyahu appeared to be joking in response to a slip by an Israeli TV interviewer, but his words reverberated through the region at a time when tensions are running high. Also on Sunday, there were emotional scenes in Bangkok airport, as five Thai workers who were released after being held hostage for over a year in Gaza arrived back home. ""We are all very grateful and very happy that we get to return to our homeland. We all would really like to thank you. I don't know what else to say,"" one of the Thai hostages, Pongsak Thaenna, told a news conference at the airport. The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' attack that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage, has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians according to local health authorities. In recent days, violence in the West Bank has intensified. On Sunday morning, the Palestinian Health Ministry said a 23-year-old Palestinian woman, who was eight months pregnant, was fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the Nur Shams urban refugee camp in northern occupied West Bank.

https://www.wired.com/story/2024-ransomware-payments-fall-chainalysis/,"For much of the past year, the trail of destruction and mayhem left behind by ransomware hackers was on full display. Digital extortion gangs paralyzed hundreds of US pharmacies and clinics through their attack on Change Healthcare, exploited security vulnerabilities in the customer accounts of cloud provider Snowflake to breach a string of high-profile targets, and extracted a record $75 million from a single victim. Yet beneath those headlines, the numbers tell a surprising story: Ransomware payments actually fell overall in 2024—and in the second half of the year dropped more precipitously than in any six-month period on record. Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis today released a portion of its annual crime report focused on tracking the ransomware industry, which found that ransomware victims’ extortion payments totaled $814 million in 2024, a drop of 35 percent compared to the record $1.25 billion that hackers extracted from ransomware victims the previous year. Breaking down the payments over the course of 2024 shows an even more positive trend: Hackers collected just $321 million from July through December compared to $492 million the previous half year, the biggest falloff in payments between two six-month periods that Chainalysis has ever seen. “The drastic reversal of the trends we were seeing in the first half of the year to the second was quite surprising,” says Jackie Burns Koven, who leads cyber threat intelligence at Chainalysis. She suggests that dropoff is likely due to law enforcement takedowns and disruptions, some of which had delayed effects that weren't immediately apparent in the first half of the year as ransomware victims and the cybersecurity industry grappled with catastrophic attacks. “Don't get me wrong: For everyone who's a defender or an incident responder, it's been a year,"" Burns Koven says. “But it is noteworthy that for the major attacks that occurred last year, those groups don't exist anymore or have been laying low. There's been a strong signal from law enforcement that if you cross the line, there's going to be consequences.” US and UK law enforcement scored two significant disruptions of major ransomware groups around the beginning of 2024: Six days before Christmas of 2023, the FBI announced that it had found vulnerabilities in the encryption software used by the group known as BlackCat or AlphV, distributed decryption keys to victims to foil the group’s extortion tactics, and taken down the dark-web sites the group had used to issue its threats. Two months later, in February of 2024, the UK’s National Crime Agency carried out an operation against the notorious ransomware group Lockbit, hijacking its infrastructure, seizing its cryptocurrency wallets, taking down its dark-web sites, and even obtaining information about its members and cybercriminal partners. Initially, however, both groups seemed to bounce back from those busts. AlphV in February announced that it had hacked Change Healthcare, disabling payments at hundreds of US clinics and pharmacies and extracting $22 million from the United Healthcare–owned company in one of the worst health-care-related ransomware incidents in history. Lockbit, too, seemed to shake off the NCA’s blows, immediately launching a new dark-web site where it continued to extort victims old and new. But in fact, both law enforcement operations may have been more successful than they appeared. AlphV, after receiving its $22 million ransom from Change Healthcare, pulled a so-called “exit scam,” taking the money and disappearing rather than sharing it with the hacker partners who had carried out the Change breach. Lockbit, too, largely fell off the map in the months that followed the NCA’s takedown, due perhaps to the cybercriminal underground’s distrust of the group and its alleged leader, Dmitry Khoroshev, when it became clear the NCA had identified him. In May of 2024, Khoroshev was also sanctioned by the US Treasury, making it far more legally complicated for Lockbit victims to pay a ransom to the group. While the vacuum left behind by those major players in the ransomware ecosystem was filled by newer groups during the second half of 2024, many of them didn’t have the skills or experience to go after targets as big and as well defended as Lockbit and AlphV had, says Burns Koven. The result, she says, was far smaller ransom payments, often in the tens of thousands of dollars rather than the millions or tens of millions. “Their talent is not quite as robust as their predecessors,“ Burns Koven says of the newer generation of ransomware gangs. “We're seeing the hangover of these law enforcement takedowns, not just directly targeting individuals and strains of malware but also the infrastructure and tools and services that had been used to help perpetuate these attacks.” Last year actually saw more ransomware incidents than the previous year, says Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst focused on ransomware at the security firm Recorded Future. The firm counted 4,634 attacks in 2024 versus 4,400 in 2023. But the lower ransom amounts received by those newer ransomware groups suggests they may have been favoring quantity over quality, he says. “What we're seeing in terms of payments is a reflection of newer threat actors being attracted by the amount of money that they see you can make in ransomware, trying to get into the game and not being very good at it,” Liska says. In addition to major law enforcement actions at the beginning of 2024, Chainalysis attributes the decline in payments during the second half of the year to heightened global awareness about the threat of ransomware, leading to more mature defenses and response plans within governments and other institutions. And Burns Koven adds that cryptocurrency regulation and law enforcement crackdowns on money laundering infrastructure, including mixers that help criminals anonymize and obfuscate the source of their ill-gotten cryptocurrencies, have also eroded ransomware actors’ abilities to handle payments without specialized knowledge. While the decline in payments during the second half of 2024 is significant for being the largest ever in Chainalysis’s data, the number of ransomware attacks and volume of payments has fluctuated and declined before. Notably, researchers saw a marked decrease in activity in 2022, a year in which Chainalysis placed total ransomware payments at $655 million compared to $1.07 billion in 2021 and nearly $1 billion in 2020. But while governments and defenders were initially heartened that their deterrence efforts were working, ransomware surged back as an even more dire threat in 2023, totaling, by Chainalysis’s count, $1.25 billion in payments that year. ""I think ebbs and flows are inevitable,"" says Brett Callow, a managing director at FTI Consulting and longtime ransomware researcher. ""If the baddies had a couple of brilliant quarters, a dip will follow, same as if the goodies had some good quarters. That's why we really need to analyze trends over a longer period, because increases and decreases over shorter periods don't really tell us much.” Additionally, researchers have long warned that it is difficult to get truly reliable numbers about the volume of ransomware attacks and an accurate total of payments each year. This is partly the result of attackers attempting to inflate their records and make themselves seem more effective and menacing by claiming old data breaches as new attacks or simply making up attacks that they haven’t actually carried out. And it is always difficult to get accurate numbers about ransomware (not to mention digital scams more broadly), because stigma and regulatory requirements often keep victims from coming forward. This makes ransomware forecasting more of an art than a science. ""My vibe from the second half of 2024 is that if there was a decrease, there will also be a rebound,"" Callow says. Chainalysis researchers are clear that the 2024 payment decline is not a guarantee of future reductions in ransomware attacks. But Burns Coven emphasizes that for defenders who are in the trenches on incident response, the data point is useful for making the case that sustained investment in ransomware defense is worthwhile. “We're still standing in the rubble, right? We can't go tell everyone, everything's great, we solved ransomware—they’re continuing to go after schools, after hospitals and critical infrastructure,"" says Burns Koven. But, she adds, “I don't think anybody's necessarily celebrating. I think it's a signal of what work needs to be continued.”","Despite Catastrophic Hacks, Ransomware Payments Dropped Dramatically Last Year","Andy Greenberg, Lily Hay Newman",WIRED,2025-02-05T08:00:00,2025-02-05T08:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/turkiye-open-to-hosting-palestinian-prisoners-freed-by-israel-fm-fidan-114035/,"Türkiye is willing to accept Palestinians released from Israeli prisons as part of the ongoing ceasefire agreement, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said during an official visit to Qatar. ‘Türkiye willing to host’ Speaking at a joint press conference with Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani in Doha, Fidan stated that Türkiye, along with other nations, is prepared to host freed Palestinian detainees if required under the terms of the agreement. “As part of the cease-fire agreement, one of the conditions involves ensuring that certain freed Palestinian prisoners do not remain in Palestinian territories. To support the agreement, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed that Türkiye is willing to host them, along with other countries,” Fidan said. He stressed that ensuring the implementation and continuation of the cease-fire is a priority, adding that other nations must also fulfill their commitments to maintain stability. Türkiye opposes forced displacement of Palestinians Fidan reaffirmed Türkiye’s position against the forced displacement of Palestinians, stating that Ankara fully supports the Cairo Declaration, which calls for the protection of Palestinian rights and an end to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. “We oppose any plans to displace the Palestinian people from Gaza or force them to relocate to other countries. It is everyone’s duty to stand against such attempts,” Fidan said. “The ceasefire in Gaza must continue. Israel needs to move away from preventing the delivery of aid to Gaza. The international community must play its part. We are totally against the project of expelling the Palestinian people from Gaza and sending them to other countries. This is really a proposal against humanitarian law.” Fidan stated that everyone should stand against it. Türkiye monitoring developments in Syria The Turkish foreign minister also addressed regional security concerns, stating that Türkiye is closely watching the new administration in Syria regarding its stance on the terrorist organization PKK/YPG. “We are closely following the new Syrian administration’s approach toward PKK/YPG and will not tolerate any situation where terrorism finds a foothold in Syria,” he said. Fidan underlined that Türkiye remains committed to preventing the presence and expansion of terrorist organizations in its southern borders and will take necessary measures to ensure regional stability. The Syrian people must take control of their own administration and transition process. As neighboring countries, we are in communication on how we can assist in this matter. Significant steps need to be taken regarding the reconstruction of the country and its urgent needs. We are working together to find immediate solutions to Syria’s pressing issues. The lifting of international sanctions is crucial. The unification of armed groups under a national army is important. The fight against terrorism is also a key issue. The Damascus administration continues its efforts to reach out to and find a solution regarding the YPG issue. As Türkiye, we are closely monitoring these developments. Our hope is that the issue can be resolved without bloodshed. However, we cannot tolerate terrorism taking root in Syria. Ensuring an uninterrupted ceasefire in Gaza is a priority for us. After the ceasefire, we have observed difficulties in delivering aid to the region. Israel must abandon its obstructive approach. As Türkiye, we have great sensitivity on this issue. We are making every effort to deliver aid in the best and fastest way possible. During Syria’s transition process, we are in close communication with both Syria and our regional partners. There was a need for a cabinet, and with the formation of a government, we believe major uncertainties will be eliminated. At the end of his speech, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan addressed recent issues with the United States in response to a question. “We have shared this issue with our American friends many times. At this point, the ideal outcome would be to clarify the real’security issue’ for the Americans. The core issue here is that the YPG is providing detention services for Daesh prisoners and managing the camp population. Other than this, there is no additional security concern.” Fidan stated that the YPG lacks independent capability in the fight against Daesh and terrorism, emphasizing that the group itself is a terrorist organization. “Türkiye, Iraq, Syria, and Jordan have the capability to combat Daesh together. We have already held preliminary discussions, and we hope to take concrete steps as four nations,” Fidan said. Fidan also expressed Ankara’s expectation that the United States will abandon policies that pose a threat to Türkiye’s security. “We hope that our American friends will abandon this policy, which threatens Türkiye. At the same time, we can work towards an alternative formula that ensures Daesh detainees remain in prison.” He also noted that the new administration in Syria has expressed readiness to take responsibility in this matter, while Türkiye is also prepared to provide full support. “We hope that with the decision of Mr. Trump, the ongoing mistake in the region will come to an end. This issue not only fuels instability in the region but is also an open wound damaging Türkiye-U.S. relations. We wish for this matter to be resolved.” Qatar-Türkiye diplomatic cooperation During his visit, Fidan held discussions with Qatari officials regarding bilateral relations, the Gaza ceasefire, and broader Middle East security concerns. “Türkiye and Qatar have strategic relations and this relationship contributes greatly to the peace, security and prosperity of the region,” FM Fidan said.  “We talked about what needs to be done for Syria’s urgent needs. Syria’s outstanding problems need an international solution,” he added.  “The people have urgent problems that require solutions. As Türkiye and Qatar, we are working in close cooperation on what can be done. Certain projects have already been finalized, and our goal is to bring them to life,” Fidan concluded.",Türkiye open to hosting Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel:\u00a0FM\u00a0Fidan,Newsroom,Türkiye Today,2025-02-02T15:13:46,2025-02-04T13:33:56,gemini-2.0-flash

A military medical team currently in Israel played a key role in coordinating the men’s release and will continue working to facilitate their return as soon as possible. Before departing for Israel on Friday night, Mr Maris said that as far as he was aware, the hostages who were freed on Thursday were in good physical health. However, he noted that their prolonged captivity may have significantly impacted their mental health. “It will likely take eight to ten days for them to undergo thorough physical and mental health examinations, as well as an assessment to determine their fitness to fly home,” he said. “Of course, we want them to reunite with their families as soon as possible,” he added. “Being back with their loved ones should also aid in their mental recovery.” The minister expressed gratitude to Israel for its continued efforts in securing the release of the hostages, as well as to the Thai military team that worked for nearly a month to facilitate their freedom. He also extended Thailand’s appreciation to Qatar, Egypt, Iran, and Turkey for their assistance.
