https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2025/february/name-1041143-en.html,"RICHMOND, VA – Governor Glenn Youngkin announced today that he submitted an Expedited Major Disaster Declaration to President Donald J. Trump to support the ongoing response and recovery efforts of communities impacted by the recent winter storms.

“Over the past week, the Commonwealth has been hit extremely hard, particularly in areas that are still recovering from Hurricane Helene,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “This is the fifth major flood in this area in the past five years and there is significant damage that is affecting community lifelines. It is critical that we provide relief, and we will certainly take every measure possible to ensure that these areas are able to make a full recovery as quickly as possible. I want to thank our state and local agencies, and our federal, state and local elected officials for the incredible collaboration, and our first responders who have courageously made more than 150 swift water rescues and facilitated emergency operations that have saved lives throughout these storms.”

As the winter storms and flooding moved in, over seven inches of rain fell in some areas of Southwest Virginia with significant life-threatening flash flooding across Virginia’s most vulnerable and least resourced areas, resulting in historic river crests on the James River and other major waterways that have not been seen in the commonwealth since 1977. This resulted in critical infrastructure damages, over 203,000 customers without power at its peak, over 270 road closures including low water bridge and road washouts, and 9-1-1 center outages. The towns of Grundy and Hurley (Buchanan County) have experienced catastrophic flooding, with the river gauges in these towns spiking historical flood levels. Throughout the regions, over 150 swift water rescues, including evacuations, were made on Sunday, February 16. Support efforts continue as high water is blocking access to critical facilities, and access to the hardest hit areas is not yet available due to receding water and debris.

PERSONAL PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS

As communities continue to face flooding concerns, below are some flood safety and preparedness tips.

Failing to evacuate flooded areas, entering flood waters, or remaining after a flood has passed can result in injury or death. Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States.

* Remember that flash floods can come with no warning. They can cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings, and create landslides.
* Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown!
* Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.
* Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.
* Stay away from downed wires and do not approach or touch trees or limbs that are entangled with wires as they could be extremely dangerous. If those are in state maintained roadways, VDOT crews must await the power company to remove any electrical hazard before addressing downed trees or other roadway debris.
* Power outages are affecting traffic signals in some areas. Treat all inoperable traffic signals as four-way stops.
* For questions or to report hazardous road conditions such as flooding or downed trees and powerlines, contact VDOT’s 24-hour Customer Service Center by visiting	my.vdot.virginia.gov	for calling 800-FOR-ROAD (367-7623).
* Check roadway conditions by using VDOT’s free 511 mobile app, which offers information about road conditions, traffic, incidents, construction and congestion as well as access to traffic cameras, weather and more. Information is also available at 511.vdot.virginia.gov or by calling 511 while in Virginia.
* Visit VDOT’s Districts webpage for more details in your area.
* Determine how best to protect yourself based on the type of flooding.
* Evacuate if told to do so.
* Move to higher ground or a higher floor.
* Stay where you are.

How to prepare for flooding:

* Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts.
* If flash flooding is a risk in your location, then monitor potential signs, such as heavy rain.
* Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response.
* Gather supplies in case you have to leave immediately, or if services are cut off. Keep in mind each person’s specific needs, including medication. Don’t forget the needs of pets. Obtain extra batteries and charging devices for phones and other critical equipment.
* Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies.
* Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters.

What to do during a flood:

* Depending on where you are, and the impact and the warning time of flooding, go to the safe location that you previously identified.
* If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Never drive around barricades. Local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of flooded areas.
* Listen to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions.
* Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown!
* Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning.
* If your vehicle is trapped in rapidly moving water, then stay inside. If water is rising inside the vehicle, then seek refuge on the roof.
* If trapped in a building, then go to its highest level. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising floodwater. Go on the roof only if necessary. Once there, signal for help.

Be safe after a flood:

* Listen to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.
* Avoid driving, except in emergencies.
* Wear heavy gloves and boots during clean up.
* Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off the electricity to prevent electric shock.
* Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris and be contaminated. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.
* Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.

Cleaning up from a flood:

* Personal safety is always the highest priority when entering buildings damaged by floodwater.
* Check for structural damage before re-entering your home to avoid being trapped in a building collapse.
* Keep power off until an electrician has inspected your system for safety.
* Turn off the gas. Be alert for gas leaks.
* Look before you step. After a flood, the ground and floors are covered with debris, including broken bottles and nails. Floors and stairs that have been covered with mud can be very slippery.
* Take photos of any floodwater in your home and of damaged items for insurance purposes.
* Rescue the most valuable items but never attempt to salvage belongings at the expense of your own safety.
* Wear long sleeves, sturdy shoes or waterproof boots, and plastic or rubber gloves during cleanup.
* Wash your hands often with soap and clean water or use a hand-cleaning gel with alcohol in it.
* Mold can form within 48 hours; you will need to work fast. If you do encounter extensive mold, use protective gear such as gloves, goggles, and an N95 or N100 face mask, available at most hardware stores.
* The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers guidelines for mold cleanup after floods.
* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a number of helpful resources, about hazards you may encounter when cleaning up inside and outside your home.

Emergency Alerts

* These days, emergency alerts can reach you in so many ways–WEA (Wireless Emergency Alerts) come to your cell phone, EAS (Emergency Alert System) on TV and Radio, NOAA weather radio alerts, mobile apps and more. It’s important to have several different ways you can receive emergency alerts, and to be armed with the knowledge you need before an emergency happens.
* Know the current forecast and get alerted for any watches, warnings, or advisories on the National Weather Service’s website
* Download FEMA app and local news apps for severe weather alerts
* Sign up to receive alerts on your phone, tune in to your local weather station, or listen to your NOAA Weather Radio

The heavy rain Saturday evening has caused a levee there to break, and floodwaters are pouring into the surrounding area. Emergency officials are calling it a life-threatening situation. ""It’s worse than I have seen it before. It’s truly a life-threatening event,"" Rives Fire Chief Campbell Rice said. The small-town community of Rives, Tenn., looks more like a lake as rising floodwaters swallow lawns and cars Sunday afternoon. ""We had the saturated ground, and the rivers were all full. And just all of a sudden we were inundated with water,"" Rice said. Obion County Mayor Steve Carr issued a mandatory evacuation for people living in Rives due to the rising water and no electricity. ""If anybody tries to stay there, they are not going to have any electricity or heat, and we are about to have subfreezing temperatures moving in tonight, so it is going to be a very dangerous situation,"" he said. Mayor Carr, made the declaration in a post to his Facebook page, saying: According to a post on their X page, the National Weather Service in Memphis said the levee near Rives in Obion County had failed Sunday morning, resulting in ""rapid onset flooding of the town of Rives and surrounding areas."" Water rescues are now underway as emergency crews take boats door to door. The Millington Fire Department said it sent a water rescue team of six people and equipment to Rives, adding that additional water rescue teams from Collierville, Tipton County and Madison County had been dispatched as well. ""Fire administration was notified at 7:30 this morning of extensive flooding in the area, and the request for water teams was issued,"" the department wrote in a post to X. ""The teams have arrived in the area and have boats in the water conducting recon missions of flooded properties in that community."" ""We did have some folks that have gotten cold and wet, and they’ve been taken to the hospital for treatment, but we’ve had no serious injuries or deaths, so we are thankful for that,"" Carr said.  As the county prepares to rebuild, more departments and people are stepping up to help. ""This is kind of what these guys do. They jump in and help other departments,"" Collierville Fire Chief John Selberg said. ""A lot of them are on their days off, and it's kind of nice because next time you’re going to be the one who needs it. So it is always nice to get out and help someone else."" They are closely monitoring the situation and stress the seriousness of the potential for further levee breakage, Mayor Carr said.  Mayor Carr, in a separate statement on the situation, said: ""Dear Residents of Rives and Obion County, Today is a very sad day for our community and our hearts hurt for all those who are affected by the ongoing flood crisis. As we face the ongoing challenges posed by the severe flooding in our area, I want to assure you that our first responders and swift water rescue teams are working tirelessly to bring those in need to safety. I am amazed at the number of agencies and personnel who have come to the aid of the residents of Rives. Their dedication and bravery in these trying times is commendable, and we are grateful for their service. We are closely monitoring the situation regarding the levees, and I must stress the seriousness of the potential for levee breakage. This is a critical moment, and the safety of this community is our top priority. If you do not live in Rives, at this time the best help you can offer is to avoid the area. We know people are concerned about their fellow citizens, however, we can not allow you to jeopardize these critical rescue missions. I strongly encourage all residents of Rives to evacuate as soon as possible. Please heed the warnings and take necessary precautions to protect yourself and your loved ones. If you require assistance or transportation, do not hesitate to reach out to local authorities. In terms of evacuees and patients - we do not have a count as to the number because it is very early in this crisis. We are transporting any patients to our local hospital with at least one in critical condition. Please remember everyone involved in your prayers. Together, we will navigate through this crisis.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-943c9a5e-32c0-4eae-8abb-4d9c4c6eae1e,"President Donald Trump has made repeated claims that China “operates” the Panama Canal in recent weeks and has threatened to take back the waterway to block what he sees as Beijing’s increasing influence. A BBC Verify analysis shows that the US remains the main user of the canal, but Chinese involvement in infrastructure projects around the waterway - which is operated directly by Panama - has grown in recent years. Up to 14,000 ships use the 51-mile (82km) passage each year. It links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the Central American country, avoiding an otherwise lengthy and costly trip around South America. The waterway cuts the amount of time it takes goods to flow from Shenzhen in China to the US east coast, or between San Francisco and New York, by weeks. After Panama signed up to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2017 - where Beijing invests in infrastructure across the globe - Chinese companies were more active around the canal. Panama left the partnership earlier this month amid US pressure. However, much of Trump’s ire has been focused on Chinese control over ports which predate the BRI. There are five container ports around the Panama Canal. All of them are operated by foreign companies.  Three of the canal’s main container ports - Colon, Rodman and Manzanillo - are operated by companies based in Singapore, Taiwan and the US.  But much of the US attention has focused on the two biggest, Cristóbal and Balboa. They sit at either end of the canal and have been operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings since 1997.   While the company is a private corporation based outside the Chinese mainland, experts have told the BBC that the Chinese national security law introduced in 2020 could allow China to exercise influence over Hong Kong-based companies in the event of a conflict.  “In terms of the day-to-day, I’m sceptical as to whether there’s a direct line between Beijing and CK Hutchison, but in a time of a crisis or a conflict it would be relatively trivial for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to say we’re going to use the ports,” Henry Ziemer, an Americas specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told the BBC.  This view was echoed by the former commander of the US military’s southern command, Gen Laura J Richardson. She told lawmakers in 2023 that “in any potential global conflict, the PRC [China] could leverage strategic regional ports to restrict US naval and commercial ship access”.  The chairman of CK Hutchison - Victor Li Tzar-kuoi - serves as a member of the national committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), according to his company website.  The CPPCC is China's top political advisory body comprising of thousands of members and is part of the “United Front System” which works to aid government influence domestically and abroad. Its members usually include top corporate figures. BBC Verify approached CK Hutchison Holdings for comment.  While Trump’s attention has focused on Balboa and Cristóbal, Chinese companies have been involved in projects elsewhere around the canal - with one major bridge project attracting some attention.  Three bridges currently cross the canal at various points. Slightly north of the Bridge of the Americas, a Chinese corporation is building the new Fourth Bridge, connecting Panama City to West Panama. This is the site in March 2024. The deal - which the Reuters news agency reported was worth about $1.42bn - has been beset by delays.  But satellite images over the past year show development of the bridge has picked up, as seen here in January 2025. US officials have raised concerns over the involvement of Chinese firms in the project. Republican Senator Ted Cruz recently said that the “partially-completed bridge gives China the ability to block the canal without warning”, but did not elaborate as to how he thought the bridge could be used as an obstacle. Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama at the time, visits the site of the Fourth Bridge Project in 2019 Other major projects include the Amador Cruise Terminal built by the China Harbour Engineering Company on the Pacific side of the canal.   And an extension to the Panama City Metro which will run under the south end of the canal is being built by the China Railway Tunnel Group Company.  But while these projects represent some Chinese interests around the canal, Panamanian authorities have shelved several other high profile Chinese-led projects.  Eddie Tapiero, a Panama-based economist, said he believed that around 50% of projects initiated after Panama joined the BRI have been discontinued or suspended. In 2022, a major project intended to develop a new port on Isla Margarita on the Caribbean side of the canal was cancelled. A proposed high-speed rail line across the country from Panama City to David in the west of the country was also shelved after a new government came to power in Panama. And a plan to build a new Chinese embassy on the Amador Causeway Islands - which sit at the gates of the canal - was cancelled in 2018.  Experts who spoke to the BBC have suggested that China’s influence over infrastructure had mainly expanded to fill a gap left by the US in the region.  Mr Tapiero told BBC Verify that US companies were frequently uninterested or uncompetitive in bidding processes compared to Chinese competitors - who he said were often willing to offer finance when seeking deals.  Statistics for foreign direct investment (FDI) - the amount of money countries are investing in another country - paint a similar picture.  China invested $1.4bn in Panama in 2023 - a fourfold increase since the start of the BRI in 2017 - while US investments, although far higher overall, have declined over that same period.  Annual investment in Panama From October 2023 to September 2024, shipping to or from China accounted for 21% of the cargo going through the waterway according to figures from the Panama Canal management company. However, the US remains the biggest investor in Panama and the top user of the canal by some distance. Last year, three and half times as much cargo passed through the canal going to and from the US than China. Cargo via the Panama Canal, top 15 countries, Oct 2023 to Sep 2024 Beijing’s influence in Panama may well be on the decline, says Henry Ziemer of the CSIS. The Panamanian authorities have “had a taste of what infrastructure partnership with China looks like, and they are not too pleased with that. It hasn’t delivered the big flashy gains that were promised when they first signed onto the BRI.” “That is why - along with pressure from Washington - the sense is now that Panama is seeking to move away from China.”",Mapping China’s influence around the Panama Canal  - BBC News,"Matt Murphy, Jake Horton and Erwan Rivault",BBC News,2025-02-24T09:05:19.233Z,2025-02-24T09:05:19.233Z,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/02/13/why-are-we-handing-russia-what-it-wants-eus-chief-diplomat-blasts-us-over-ukraine-a87993,"BRUSSELS — The European Union’s top diplomat slammed U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration for sidelining Ukraine
to join NATO and reclaim its 1991 borders as part of a peace settlement were “unrealistic.” He also said the U.S. would “no longer tolerate” European NATO members relying on Washington for security.

The remarks, followed by a surprise phone call between Trump and Putin in which the two agreed to enter peace talks, have stunned European officials and raised concerns that Kyiv may be sidelined in discussions about its own future.

“They [the U.S.] say that it’s not going to be NATO membership, but some other security guarantees. Then the questions need to be answered by everybody — what are these security guarantees, really?” said Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, ahead of a NATO defense ministers’ meeting.

“Being in NATO, where we have these structures, is actually the best security guarantee,” she added.

Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister known for her staunch support of Ukraine, condemned what she described as a reckless diplomatic maneuver that rewards Russian aggression before negotiations even begin.

“We shouldn’t take anything off the table before negotiations start. It plays into Russia’s hands. And it is exactly what they want,” she said. “Why are we giving them everything they want even before negotiations begin? Appeasement has never worked.”

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius echoed her concerns, warning against making public concessions ahead of talks.

“In my view, it would have been better to discuss Ukraine’s possible NATO membership or the country’s possible loss of territory only at the negotiating table, not to rule it out beforehand,” Pistorius said in Brussels.

Kallas stressed that any peace deal imposed without the consent of Ukraine and European allies was doomed to fail.

“There’s an agreement being made behind our backs that simply will not work,” she said. “For any kind of agreement, you need Europeans to implement it, you need Ukrainians to implement it.” 

“It doesn’t look good if somebody agrees on something and everybody else has to say, ‘OK, you have agreed, but we will not follow this.’ Ukrainians will resist, and we will support them,”

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte took a more diplomatic tone, arguing that the statements from Trump and Hegseth merely underscored the need for dialogue within the alliance.

“Secretary Hegseth’s comments, and what later emerged from Washington, were significant statements,” Rutte said. 

“At the same time, this is how an alliance should function,” he said. “We are a coalition of democracies. We need to debate. But I see a clear convergence: we all want peace, we want it to be lasting and we must ensure Ukraine is in the strongest possible position.” 

At the same time, Rutte noted that Europe “must also step up defense spending and industrial production.” 

“On that, there is clear agreement,” he said.A Message from The Moscow Times: Dear readers, We are facing unprecedented challenges.
