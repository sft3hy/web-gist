https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/al-shabaab-captures-strategic-somalia-town-it-presses-offensive-2025-04-16/,"MOGADISHU, April 16 (Reuters) - Al Shabaab fighters captured a town in central Somalia on Wednesday that government forces had been using as a staging area to drive back an offensive by the militants that has gained ground in recent weeks, residents and soldiers said.

Advances by theal Qaeda affiliate, which included briefly capturing villages within 50 km (30 miles) of Mogadishu last month, have left residents of the capital on edge as rumours swirl that al Shabaab could target the city.

The army has recaptured those villages, but al Shabaab continues to advance in the countryside, leading the government to deploy police officers and prison guards to support the military, soldiers have told Reuters.

Six residents and three soldiers said al Shabaab seized the town of Adan Yabaal, which lies around 245 km (150 miles) north of Mogadishu, in heavy fighting on Wednesday.

""After many hours of fighting we made a tactical retreat,"" said Aden Ismail, a military officer who transported injured soldiers to the nearby Hiiraan region.

The army and allied clan militias have been using Adan Yabaal as an operating base for raids against al Shabaab.

President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who hails from the area, visited the town last month to meet with military commanders there about sending reinforcements.

""If al Shabaab captures one town, that does not mean they overpowered us,"" Mohamud said in a speech on Wednesday, without directly naming the town. ""There is a big difference between a war and a battle.""

Al Shabaab, which has waged an insurgency since 2007 to seize power and rule based on its strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law, said in a statement that its forces had overrun 10 military installations during Wednesday's fighting.

""After early morning prayers, we heard a deafening explosion, then gunfire,"" Fatuma Nur, a mother of four, told Reuters by telephone from Adan Yabaal. ""Al Shabaab attacked us from two directions.""

National government officials were either not reachable or did not respond to requests for comment.

The fighting comes as the future of international security support to Somalia has grown increasingly precarious.

A new African Union peacekeeping mission replaced a larger force at the start of the year, but its funding is uncertain, with the United States opposed to a plan to transition to aU.N. financing model.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7pqzk47zo,"Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.

It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales.

The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.

Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.

The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.

The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.

Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words ""woman"" and ""sex"" are defined in the legislation.

He told the court: ""The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.

""But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.""

He added that the legislation gives transgender people ""protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender"".

Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears.

The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including ""sex"" and ""gender reassignment"".

Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by ""sex"" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, ""certificated"" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.

The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex ""for all purposes"".

For Women Scotland argued for a ""common sense"" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an ""immutable biological state"".

Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: ""Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex.

""Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling.""

First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement.

Heposted on social media: ""The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster.

""We will now engage on the implications of the ruling.""

Swinney added: ""Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.""

A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted ""in good faith"" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.

A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring ""clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs"".

""Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,"" the spokesman added.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenochdescribed the rulingas a ""victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious"".

She added: ""It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.""

Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: ""It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.""

But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: ""This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society.

""It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next.""

For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups.

Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender.

Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was ""shocked"" by the court ruling, arguing that it ""reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates"".

They added: ""This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services.

""It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.""

The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy overtransgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prisonand an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse whoobjected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room.

NHS Fife said it would ""carefully consider"" the court's judgement.

The judges ruled that interpreting sex as ""certificated"" rather than ""biological"" would ""cut across the definitions of man and ""woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way"".

They said a ""certified"" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian.

The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to ""function coherently"".

It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions.

The judges noted ""similar confusion and impracticability"" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces.

The judges added: ""The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.""

Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender.

However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs ""if it is proportionate to do so"".

Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman.

He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex.

But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be ""settled"" by this court case.

He told the BBC: ""It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.""

Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a ""reassessment"" of rules.

The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards.

For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law.

The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts.

Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was ""not limited to biological or birth sex"".

The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex.

The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers.

According to Israeli intelligence, Hamas has also rebuilt and is back up to 20,000-25,000 fighters.IDF sources said there is still no concrete plan to engage new private contractors to distribute food aid to Gaza. Ben-Gvir responded to Katz’s statement in a post on X/Twitter, noting, “It’s a shame that we don’t learn from mistakes.”“As long as our hostages are languishing in the tunnels, there is no reason for a single grain of food or any aid to enter Gaza. Halting the aid is one of the central pressure points on Hamas, and returning it before Hamas is on its knees and has released all our hostages would be a historic mistake.“I will do everything in my power to ensure that this historic mistake does not happen, and I call on the prime minister and the defense minister not to take this foolish step, which would harm our ability to defeat Hamas and safely bring all our hostages home,” Ben-Gvir wrote.Following Ben-Gvir’s latest criticism of Katz for acknowledging that food aid to Gaza may resume in the future, the defense minister released a bizarre statement in which he said repeatedly that food aid would not be restored at this time, but contrastingly that it would be restored in the future.

https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-fuel-exports-mexico-by-land-halted-by-higher-scrutiny-sources-say-2025-04-16/,"NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - The Mexican government has halted U.S. fuel imports sent into the country by road, as it cracks down on illegal deals, three sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

Trucks carrying gasoline and diesel to Mexico from the U.S. Gulf Coast refining hub are not being permitted to cross the Texas border as the Mexican government investigates import permits and steps up cargo inspections, one of the sources involved in such deliveries said.

There was no timeline to resume the trucking trade, the sources said, adding that railway and waterborne deliveries of fuel to Mexico from the U.S. have not been impacted.

The sources requested anonymity as the matter is not public. The Mexican government and state-owned energy company Pemex did not respond to requests for comment.

Even though Mexico is a large crude oil producer, it imports much of its fuel requirements from the U.S. as Pemex struggles to efficiently refine the heavy sour Maya crude oil grade it pumps.

Mexico is the top buyer of U.S. fuel. U.S. oil and fuel exports to the country averaged around 35.66 million barrels per day in January, according to the latest available U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

The trading route has proven lucrative for fuel smugglers, pushing Mexico to establish a decree to combat illicit fuel trade in 2023. In recent months, Mexican authorities have seized a vessel and several fuel trucks for what they said were illegal cargos.

Mexican Security Minister Omar Garcia Harfuch said on March 31 that federal authorities had seized a tanker in Tamaulipas that was carrying 10 million liters of diesel along with 192 containers and 29 vehicles to transport motor fuels as well as other vehicles.

On March 28, he said federal authorities had seized about 8 million liters of hydrocarbon products, containers and vehicles used to transport motor fuels and pumps in Baja California.

U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and drug trafficking has also increased scrutiny at the U.S.-Mexico border. Nearly 110,000 acres of federal land along the border weretransferredto the U.S. Army to help prevent illegal immigration, the U.S. Interior Department said on Tuesday.

https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-offers-cheap-loans-arms-targeting-russias-traditional-customers-2025-04-16/,"NEW DELHI, April 16 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi's bid to transform India into a global factory floor has produced billions of dollars of low-cost iPhones and pharmaceuticals. Now he hopes to add missiles, helicopters and battleships to the shopping carts of foreign governments.

The world's largest importer of weapons after Ukraine is expanding the ability of the state-owned Export-Import Bank (EXIM) to offer long-term, low-cost loans to clients, including those whose political or credit risk profiles may limit their access to conventional financing, according to two Indian officials and three industry sources.

New Delhi will also sharply increase the number of defense attachés in its foreign missions as part of a new program that will see the government directly negotiate some arms deals, four Indian officials said. India is particularly targeting governments which have long relied on Russia for arms, two of the people said.

India's plans, which were detailed to Reuters by 15 people and have not been previously reported, mark an unprecedented effort by the government to inject itself into the recruitment and financing of foreign buyers as the world is rearming and longstanding geopolitical relationships are being recast.

Indian bureaucrats have long focused more on buying fighter aircraft from Russia's Sukhoi and howitzers from the United States to ward off China and Pakistan, Delhi's two nuclear-armed neighbors. While India has long had a small-arms production sector, its private firms have only recently started to make higher-end munitions and equipment.

“India is marching towards achieving the target of increasing defence exports,” defense minister Rajnath Singh wrote on X this month.

One turning point was Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to an Indian official tasked with growing arms exports. Like most of the people interviewed by Reuters for this story, the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive government matters.

Spare Western arsenals were shipped to Kyiv while Russia's factories churned out munitions almost exclusively for its war effort. That left other nations that had historically relied on Washington and Moscow - the world's two largest arms exporters - scrambling for alternatives.

With its history of buying and absorbing arms technology from both the West and Russia, Delhi started to get more inquiries, the official said.

In response to Reuters' questions, Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport referred to previously issued statements that said it was in talks with India about jointly producing and promoting equipment to third-party states that are ""friendly to Russia.""

The Pentagon had no comment.

India produced $14.8 billion of arms in 2023-2024 fiscal year, up 62% since 2020, government data show. Some Indian-made artillery shells were found onthe frontline in Ukrainein support of Kyiv's defense, Reuters previously reported.

Delhi has started brokering meetings between visiting delegations and domestic arms contractors, as well as demonstrating more sophisticated equipment like combat helicopters during military exercises, four officials said.

Viraj Solanki, a research fellow at London's International Institute for Strategic Studies think-thank, said India faced challenges selling its newer and more high-end wares.

""Unless it starts using its indigenous equipment more frequently and demonstrating its effectiveness, it is likely to struggle to convince potential buyers,"" he said.

Modi's government has set a target of doubling arms-and-equipment exports to $6 billion by 2029. It hopes sales will go beyond the ammunition, small arms and defense-equipment components that currently compose much of its military exports.

Delhi missed its target of $3.5 billion in arms sales for the latest fiscal year by about a third, but that still marks a significant increase from the $230 million in weapons and defense components it exported a decade ago.

At a time of stretched global budgets and burgeoning defense demand, India is pitching itself partially as a relatively low-cost producer.

India can produce 155 mm artillery ammunition for about $300 to $400 a piece, two Indian sources said, while European equivalents sell for upwards of $3,00

Indian firms have also sold howitzers for about $3 million each, one of them said, or roughly half what a European-made version costs.

While Western nations that reduced artillery and other defense production after the Cold War are rushing to restart factories, state-owned Munitions India was among Indian firms that kept such capacity.

Delhi with has faced off with Pakistan and China in combat. 

Private manufacturers like Adani Defense and Aerospace and armor-and-ammunition maker SMPP are beginning to produce 155 mm artillery shells, which they said had already been ordered by foreign governments. 

""With this changing scenario, definitely we see a huge, massive demand for artillery ammunition,"" said SMPP chief executive Ashish Kansal, whose company is setting up a plant to manufacture large caliber 155 mm artillery ammunition.

India plans to use increased financing of arms exports via EXIM, which had a loan portfolio of $18. 

Such financing will largely be conducted by EXIM's commercial business, which has the state as a backstop but doesn't draw solely from the national budget. Indian arms makers lobbied heavily for the move, an industry source said.

Most banks in India have been unwilling to offer commercial loans for arms exports because they don't want to deal with countries that may have higher credit and political risks, one Indian diplomat told Reuters.

That has long hampered India from competing on big deals with countries like France, Turkey and China, whose packages come with financing or credit guarantees, the diplomat said.

One market India is hoping to expand in is Brazil, where EXIM opened an office in January.

Delhi is in talks to sell Akash missiles to Brasília, according to two industry sources and two Brazilian officials, and an Indian official. Even as India faces shortfalls in its own shipbuilding capacity, it is also pursuing a deal to build battleships for Brazil, according to the two Brazilian officials and an Indian official.

The police's special investigation team on Yoon's Dec. 3 martial law declaration searched the presidential office's secure phone server and the PSS office and residence, all in the central Seoul district of Yongsan, in the morning, police officials said.

Kim is accused of obstructing investigators' attempt to detain Yoon at the presidential residence in January. Last month, a Seoul court turned down the prosecution's request for warrants to arrest Kim and Lee Kwang-woo, chief of the PSS' bodyguard division.

Police officials said the presidential office's surveillance cameras are also subject to the raid in connection with former Interior Minister Lee Sang-min's insurrection charges.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250416003000320?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, April 16 (Yonhap) -- A high-level South Korean delegation plans to visit the United Arab Emirates (UAE) this week to bolster Seoul's bids for high-speed railway and infrastructure projects in the Middle East nation, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said Wednesday.

Led by Land Minister Park Sang-woo, the delegation will meet with UAE Minister of Energy and Infrastructure Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei on Friday to discuss bilateral cooperation in the transport and infrastructure sectors, with a focus on the UAE's envisioned high-speed railway project connecting Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

The ministry has formed a public-private sector team, including the state-run Korea National Railway, Korea Railroad Corp. (KORAIL), Hyundai Rotem Co. and POSCO E&C Co., for the UAE railway project bid. The team has passed the prequalification stage of the bidding process.

The delegation plans to emphasize South Korea's technological excellence and economic viability of its high-speed rail models, citing recent successes in securing high-value export deals from Uzbekistan and Morocco.

The delegation will also discuss follow-up cooperation based on a memorandum of understanding signed last year during the UAE president's state visit to South Korea

Under the agreement, South Korea and the UAE aim to jointly enter third-country infrastructure markets, particularly in post-conflict recovery zones, by combining South Korea's construction expertise with UAE's financial capabilities.

The government earlier said such cooperation may serve as a bargaining chip in the tariff negotiations after U.S. President Donald Trump highlighted Seoul's interest in a multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Alaska.

""The government will put in all-out efforts to make the most of the 90-day grace period by refining our response strategy for (tariff) negotiations with an aim of securing our national interests,"" Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo said in a meeting with the trade policy advisory committee.

""We will consolidate economic cooperation between the two countries in shipbuilding, energy and other areas of mutual interest,"" he added, stressing that the U.S. is South Korea's ""most important"" ally.

The Trump administration implemented its country-specific reciprocal tariff scheme, including a 25 percent duty for South Korea, earlier in the month, only to have it suspended for 90 days hours later.

Washington has since said it will hold trade negotiations with major trading partners. Negotiations between South Korea and the U.S. are widely expected to be held next week.

Various morning attacks by Russian aviation and artillery on the southern city of Kherson also killed one person and injured three more, local authorities said.

In a Telegram post, Ukraine's emergency service said three people were injured and several fires broke out in Odesa as a result of the overnight attack there.

In Odesa, residents picked through debris in several ruined homes. A woman swept up after the windows in a church were smashed.

The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 57 out of 97 drones launched by Russia overnight. Another 34 did not reach their targets likely due to electronic warfare countermeasures.

It did not specify what happened to the remaining six drones.

The emergency services also said an attack on Kamianske in Dnipropetrovsk region injured two people and damaged a gas pipeline. The fires had been put out by the morning.

Reuters could not independently verify the reports. There was no immediate comment from Russia.

Both sides deny targeting civilians inthe warthat Russia started with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago.

Late in March, the United States said it had reached separate deals with Ukraine and Russia to pause their attacks over the Black Sea and against each other's energy targets.

Both sides have repeatedly accused each other of breaking the moratorium on striking energy facilities.

TOKYO -- Japan's automakers and suppliers are undertaking a rare industrywide effort to boost their competitiveness against Chinese rivals that have pulled ahead in the smart vehicle race.

ASRA, a consortium that includes Toyota Motor, Nissan Motor and Honda Motor, is leading discussions to create a standardized design for next-generation automotive chips that it hopes to have ready by March 2029. Standardizing chip development would help car companies reduce costs and accelerate development schedules -- potentially making up for lost time.

The ministry issued the statement as the SCL came into force Tuesday. The DOE's inclusion of South Korea in the list's lowest category has emerged as a hot button issue in bilateral relations.

""We have been actively engaging in negotiations, including working-level consultations at the director-general levels with the U.S. Department of Energy, together with relevant ministries,"" the ministry said, recalling that the two sides have agreed to work out the issue ""promptly through due procedures.""

""However, as this matter is proceeding in accordance with the U.S. internal procedures, we expect that more time will be needed,"" it said.

The DOE confirmed last month that the preceding Biden administration added South Korea to the SCL in early January -- a list that includes North Korea, China and Russia.

The designation has stoked concern it could affect science and technology cooperation between the allies. The listed countries are subject to stricter scrutiny when access is requested to DOE research institutions or other facilities for technology cooperation or other purposes.

The ministry cited the DOE reaffirming that the designation ""will not affect bilateral cooperation in ongoing or future research and development.""

A foreign ministry official said the government and relevant research institutions are monitoring the situation to see whether any research projects or related exchanges have been affected.

""So far, we have not identified any cases that have been impacted,"" the official said.

A diplomatic source said that other U.S. allies had been included on the list in the past before later being removed. South Korea was designated on the list in 1981 and was taken off in July 1994, following seven months of negotiations.

Multiple sources in Washington said Seoul has not been informed of any DOE decision to reverse the listing before the designation took effect this week, signaling South Korea is now included in the SCL.

https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-court-finds-ex-president-humala-guilty-money-laundering-2025-04-15/,"Peru's former President Ollanta Humala to 15 years in prison for receiving illicit campaign funds from a Brazilian construction firm, making him the nation's latest former leader to head behind bars.

Humala and his wife were accused of receiving funds from Brazilian builder Odebrecht, now known as Novonor, in his successful 2011 election campaign.

Humala's wife, Nadine Heredia, was also sentenced to 15 years in prison on Tuesday.

Peru's foreign ministry said that following the verdict Heredia entered the Brazilian embassy in Lima to request asylum.

According to one of Humala's lawyers in Brazil, Marco Aurelio de Carvalho, Heredia has cancer and had previously requested permission to travel to Brazil for treatment, but the request was declined.

Following the verdict, Peru's Foreign Ministry said Heredia entered the Brazilian embassy in Lima to request diplomatic asylum, which was granted for her and her youngest son.

The Peruvian government also said it would provide safe-passage and guarantees for their transfer.

Humala, a retired military officer who led the Andean nation from 2011 to 2016, will likely carry out his sentence on a police base built specially to house Peru's jailed leaders.

Former presidents Alejandro Toledo and Pedro Castillo are currently jailed at the site, while Alberto Fujimori stayed there until his release in 2023.

During his trial, which lasted three years after an investigation which kicked off in 2016, Humala decried the charges as political persecution.

Prosecutors alleged Humala received the illicit funds in his 2011 campaign against Keiko Fujimori - the other former president's daughter - through Humala's Nationalist Party.

His imprisonment will be effective immediately, even if he appeals the conviction. The court is expected to continue reading out the full sentencing over the next several days.

Humala's lawyer, Wilfredo Pedraza, called the sentence ""excessive,"" saying prosecutors failed to prove the illegal origin of the funds. He said the defense plans to appeal once the final ruling is issued on April 29.

A one-time construction colossus, Odebrecht has admitted that itdoled out bribesto governments across Latin America to help build its vast empire. Itchanged its nameto Novonor in 2020 and is currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings.

Humala is Peru's second former president to be jailed and the fourth to be implicated for his role in the sweeping graft case known as ""Lava Jato.""

In 2019, former President Alan Garcia killed himself by gunshot wound as police descended on his home to arrest him for alleged corruption related to the firm.

The year before, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was forced to step down after just two years in office. Meanwhile, Toledo was sentenced to two decades in prison last year after receiving $35 million in bribes in exchange for public works contracts.

Former Odebrecht executives have said in Peruvian court that the firm had financed nearly all presidential candidates in the country for a nearly 30-year period.

https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/several-french-prisons-have-come-under-attack-says-justice-minister-2025-04-15/,"PARIS, April 15 (Reuters) - France's justice minister said on Tuesday gun and arson attacks on at least six prisons around the country were acts of terrorism directed at security officials charged with guarding some of the nation's most hardened crime kingpins.

Visiting Toulon prison in southern France, whose entrance was shot at with an AK-47 automatic rifle, Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin said he could not be sure if the attacks were linked to government efforts to clamp down on France's fast-growing drug trade.

But he said authorities were making life much harder for imprisoned gangsters, and the government would not shy away from tackling drug crime, which has boosted support for the far right.

""The Republic will not back down,"" he told reporters. ""These are extremely serious crimes ... an attack on the public prison service, that is, a terrorist attack.""

Years of record South American cocaine imports to Europe have transformed local drug markets, sparking a wave of violence.

Despite record cocaine seizures in France, gangs are reaping windfalls as they expand from traditional power bases in cities such as Marseille into smaller towns unused to drug violence.

Darmanin, who plans to create new high-security prisons to crack down on gangsters who run their empires from behind bars, said at least six prisons had been targeted.

Prison officers' union UFAP said vehicles were set on fire outside jails in Villepinte, Nanterre, Aix-Luynes, and Valence. In Nancy, a prison officer was threatened at home, while in Marseille, there was an attempted arson attack. 

The National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office (PNAT) said it had taken charge of the probe into the attacks, which also targeted the National School of Prison Administration. The PNAT said officers from France's domestic intelligence agency DGSI would assist in the investigation.

""The nature of these facts, the targets chosen and the concerted character of an action committed on multiple points on the territory, as well as the objective to seriously disturb public order with intimidation ... leads, at this stage, the national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office to take charge to ensure, in this unprecedented context, national coordination of the probes involved,"" PNAT said in a statement.

PNAT said its investigation may involve charges, including attempted murder with a terrorist outfit committed against a person in a position of public authority.

Darmanin said it was unusual for PNAT, rather than specialised organised crime prosecutors, to take charge of the investigation, but it was justified due to the national scale of attacks against symbols of the state.

The letters ""DDPF"" - apparently an acronym for ""French prisoners' rights"" - were tagged on many of the attack sites, and police sources suggested it could be the work of a far-left militant group.

Darmanin said there had been DDPF groups on Telegram and Signal that had encouraged attacks against prisons, but ""there hasn't been any claim of responsibility.""

""I don't know who's behind this slogan, and I don't care because what I remember is not that a prison door was tagged, but that it was shot at by a Kalashnikov,"" he said.

Darmanin said the prison attacks reminded him of contracts given to gangsters to threaten, assault or kill rivals.

""We generally see such things between thugs; we rarely see it against the forces of the Republic,"" he said.

Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he had instructed law enforcement to step up protection of staff and prisons.

The rise in gang crime has increased support for the far-right National Rally party and helped drag French politics rightward.

Darmanin has proposed measures to tighten prison security, including building high-security jails to isolate the country's top 100 kingpins.

Lawmakers are also close to approving a sweeping new anti-drug trafficking law that would create a new national organised crime prosecutors' office and give greater investigative powers to police probing drug gangs.

Authorities scored a win in February, when they captured Mohamed Amra, a French fugitive known as ""The Fly"". His high-profile escape as he was being transported from prison to court resulted in the deaths of two prison guards.

Mcebisi Jonas is former deputy finance minister and also served as investment envoy in 2018.

In 2016, he accused the government of Jacob Zuma, back then president of South Africa, of corruption, saying that the Gupta family had offered to bribe him for the position of finance minister.

The move to appoint him as special envoy to the US comes as relations between Washington and Pretoria are at their lowest point in years.

The situation rapidly deteriorated earlier this year when US president Donald Trump cut off US foreign assistance to South Africa.

And in late March, South African ambassador to the US Ebrahim Rasool was declared a persona non grata and expelled from American territory over critical remarks he made on the subject of the Trump administration.

In his statement announcing the appointment of the special US envoy, president Ramaphosa however noted that he remained ""committed to rebuilding and maintaining"" the relationship with Washington.

""Mr Jonas is entrusted with the responsibility to advance South Africa's diplomatic, trade and bilateral priorities"", noted the presidency.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgy7vwxlxo,"Hamas is said to have rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza which called for the armed group to give up its weapons.

A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks said the plan gave no commitment to end the war or for an Israeli troop pull-out - key Hamas demands - in exchange for releasing half of the living hostages which it holds.

It comes as Israel continues its military offensive in Gaza.

A security guard was killed and nine other people were injured in an air strike on a field hospital in Khan Younis, the hospital said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it struck the head of a Hamas cell.

A UN agency meanwhile warned that ""the humanitarian situation in Gaza is now likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities"".

It is six weeks since Israel allowed any supplies to enter through crossings into the Palestinian territory - by far the longest such stoppage to date.

UN agencies strongly refute Israel's claim that there is enough food in Gaza to last for a long time and suggest the blockade could breach international humanitarian law.

Israel's prime minister said the block on supplies was aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages and to extend the ceasefire which expired on 1 March.

At the same time, the UN's humanitarian affairs office stated: ""Partners on the ground report a surge in attacks causing mass civilian casualties and the destruction of some of the remaining infrastructure that's needed to keep people alive.""

Israel is said to have submitted its latest ceasefire proposal to regional mediators late last week, just days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met US President Donald Trump in Washington.

A Hamas delegation headed by chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya then met Egyptian intelligence officials in Cairo.

The senior Palestinian official told the BBC: ""The Israeli proposal relayed to the movement through Egypt explicitly called for the disarmament of Hamas without any Israeli commitment to end the war or withdraw from Gaza. Hamas therefore rejected the offer in its entirety.""

It is understood to be the first time that Israel has added Hamas disarmament as a condition for advancing a ceasefire - a red line for the group.

The Palestinian official accused Israel of stalling for time, seeking only to retrieve the hostages while prolonging the war.

It is believed that 59 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 24 are alive.

On Tuesday afternoon, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing said it had ""lost contact"" with a group of fighters holding Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander following what he described as ""a direct strike on their location"".

Abu Ubaida produced no evidence to support the claim and gave no indication of when contact had been lost. Israel has said it avoids hitting locations where it believes hostages are being held.

Hamas released a video of the 21-year-old soldier on Saturday, in which he appeared to be speaking under duress as he criticised the Israeli government.

Recently released hostages related how many were held with them in dire conditions underground. Some are in poor health with untreated injuries.

Hamas has said it is ready to return all of those held captive, in exchange for a complete end to hostilities and full Israeli pull-out from Gaza.

It previously offered five hostages in exchange for a truce extension but claims to have shown flexibility on the number of hostages to be released.

The BBC understands that Egypt has put forward a modified proposal to Hamas which it is now considering.

Israeli media had not been anticipating an imminent ceasefire breakthrough.

The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth quoted an unnamed Israeli senior security official as saying: ""We assess that there will be a deal within two-three weeks, but right now there are still gaps and the distance is great.""

""We want to get them to release 19 living hostages. Israel and the United States are co-ordinated, and the military pressure is having an impact,"" the official went on.

""They have a shortage of gas, and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents' return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. Pressure from the residents has begun. That's rattled them.""

Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza on 18 March and then restarted ground operations, saying it was targeting Hamas. The prime minister said future ceasefire talks would be held ""under fire"".

Since Israel restarted its offensive in Gaza, at least 1,630 people have been killed - bringing the total killed in 18 months of war to 51,000, according to the latest figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.

Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the unprecedented Hamas-led 7 October attacks which triggered the war, Israel says.

On Tuesday morning, Israeli warplanes struck by the gate of the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in al-Mawasi, a crowded tented area for displaced people on the coast near Khan Younis in southern Gaza, hospital spokesman Saber Abu Arar told the BBC.

The man killed worked at the site, he said, and those injured were both hospital staff and patients. Three ambulances and some tents used as a reception area were damaged.

Graphic footage released by the field hospital on Facebook showed a man covered in blood being rushed away with attempts made to resuscitate him.

The IDF said in a statement that it ""struck the head of a Hamas terrorist cell and a combat zone commander"" outside the hospital, without giving any evidence.

It also said a ""precise munition"" was used to mitigate harm in the area.

The attack comes after the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, said he was ""deeply alarmed"" at Sunday's strike on al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, his spokesman said.

Israel said it targeted a building at the site which Hamas was using as ""a command-and-control centre"" - something the group denied.

Doctors scrambled to evacuate the hospital, saying they were given just a 20-minute warning by the IDF. A 12-year-old boy being treated for head injuries is said to have died because his care was disrupted.

The hospital - which had been the best functioning in northern Gaza - is now out of service and cannot admit new patients.

""Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,"" the spokesman for Guterres said.

He added that the attack dealt ""a severe blow to an already devastated healthcare system in the strip"", adding that with aid blocked, there was strong concern that medical supplies were now running low as well as stocks of food and water.

The UN secretary general pointed out that under international humanitarian law, an occupying power had obligations to ensure relief for the civilian population.

Recent Israeli military evacuation orders have led to wide-scale displacement of Gaza's 2.1 million population.

The UN says about 70% of the strip is currently under displacement orders or in ""no-go"" zones,"" where the Israeli authorities require humanitarian teams to coordinate their movements.

In Israel, polls suggest that a majority of Israelis back a Gaza ceasefire deal and - when it comes to their countries' stated war goals - prioritise bringing home the hostages over dismantling Hamas' governing and military capabilities.

However, Netanyahu is backed by hard-line religious ultranationalist parties who have threatened to collapse the government if he ends the war.

Israel signed onto a ceasefire deal in January, leading to the release of 33 hostages - 25 of them alive - in exchange for some 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in the first six-week stage.

It then largely refused to begin talks on the planned second stage which was supposed to lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a complete end to fighting.

In the past week, Israeli military reservists and veterans have signed several open letters condemning the ongoing war and questioning its priorities.

There has also been criticism of the IDF's chief of staff and air force commander for sacking air force reservists who signed an original statement.

This has coincided with rising frustration among reservists and their families over the cost of ongoing reserve duty along with the government's failure to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews despite the IDF facing shortages of combat soldiers.

Egyptian and Qatari mediators suggest a truce of up to seven years and a permanent end to the war. 

An Israeli military report said ""professional failures"" led to the killing of the 15 rescue workers.

Fourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed when the Israeli military opened fire on a convoy of vehicles in Gaza last month.

High-profile detentions and visa revocations are putting students on edge, as Trump tightens his squeeze on US schools. 

Witnesses in al-Mawasi told the BBC that people were burned alive as tents were engulfed in flames.

https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250415009500315?section=national/politics,"SEOUL, April 15 (Yonhap) -- Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok on Tuesday said the cost for stationing the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) is not currently among the agenda issues being reviewed for tariff talks with the United States.

""Talks on defense payments are not being reviewed at the moment,"" Choi told a parliamentary interpellation session, when asked whether discussions are under way to adjust South Korea's share of the cost for the upkeep of the 28,500-strong USFK.

When asked whether the issue could be included in the Trump administration's proposed ""package deal"" on tariffs and security issues, Choi said while he is aware of public interest in the issue, it is not among the agenda items the South Korean government is currently preparing to handle.

The finance minister, meanwhile, said a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Alaska could serve as a potential bargaining chip in the bilateral trade talks.

U.S. President Donald Trump recently highlighted the interest of South Korea and other countries in partnering with the U.S. to build a pipeline from the North Slope, a region with massive proven reserves of natural gas, to southern Alaska, where the gas would be liquefied for shipments, primarily to Asia.

Choi, however, said discussions with U.S. officials on how negotiations should proceed in the areas of LNG, shipbuilding and trade balance should come first at the current stage.

""Only national interest will be the standard for a decision,"" Choi said, when asked about the economic feasibility of the project, adding such concerns will be sufficiently reviewed.

Following his first phone call with South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo, Trump said they discussed a range of issues, including South Korea's defense payments, trade surplus with the U.S., the purchase of U.S. LNG and bilateral shipbuilding cooperation.

https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/indonesia-propose-lifting-us-oil-lpg-imports-by-around-10-billion-2025-04-15/,"jakarta, April 15 (Reuters) - Indonesia will propose increasing its imports of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas from the United States by around $10 billion as part of itstariffnegotiations, energy minister Bahlil Lahadalia told local media on Tuesday.

Indonesian officials are set to leave for Washington later on Tuesday for negotiations over proposed U.S. trade tariffs.

In total, Indonesia plans tobuy U.S. goods worth$18 billion to $19 billion as it seeks to eliminate its trade surplus with the U.S. and avoid a threatened 32% tariff on its exports.

Bahlil said the energy ministry recommended increasing the LPG import quota for the U.S., as well as importing more U.S. crude, to help reach the target.

To make room, Indonesia would need to cut LPG imports from other origins, Putra Adhiguna, managing director at thinktank Energy Shift Institute, said, adding it could start by reducing by 20%-to-30% its LPG imports from non-U.S. sources, depending on existing contracts.

Kpler data show Indonesia imported 217,000 barrels per day of LPG last year, around 124,000 bpd of which came from the U.S. Around 23,000 bpd were imported from Qatar, while United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia each contributed around 20,000 bpd.

Indonesia also imported around 306,000 bpd crude oil last year, with Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Angola as the top suppliers, Kpler data showed. Around 13,000 bpd were imported from the U.S.

Asked about the U.S. LPG import proposal, a spokeperson at state energy firm Pertamina, the biggest LPG retailer, said the company is conducting reviews of its imports and awaiting instructions from the government.

https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/imf-ghana-reach-staff-agreement-fourth-programme-review-2025-04-15/,"ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghana and the International Monetary Fund have reached a staff-level agreement on the fourth review of its $3 billion loan programme, the IMF said on Tuesday, which is set to unlock $370 million upon approval by the Fund's executive board.

The West African gold, oil, and cocoa producer is recovering from its most severe economic crisis in decades, which forced the government to restructure its debt.

Ghana's overall performance under the programme had deteriorated markedly at the end of 2024, the IMF said in the statement, but the government had since taken measures to address policy and reform shortfalls.

""The new authorities have taken bold measures to address policy slippages and ensure the program objectives remain within reach,"" it said, referring to the new government of PresidentJohn Dramani Mahama, which took over in January after an election.

The shortfalls include an accumulation of bills and an inflation rate that exceeded a set target. Some reforms and policy actions in various sectors were also delayed, the IMF said.

""On the fiscal front, the government has launched an audit of the payables to firm up the size and nature of the slippages,"" it said.

The primary budget posted a deficit of 3.25% of GDP, the IMF said, against a target of a surplus of 0.5% of GDP. The government has since adopted a budget for this year, which targets a primary surplus of 1.5% of GDP, the IMF said.

Monetary policymakers have raised themain interest ratein order to coax inflation downwards, the IMF said, and the central bank is reviewing its liquidity management operations.

""The ensuing tightening in the monetary policy stance, together with the ongoing fiscal consolidation, is expected to bring inflation down,"" it said.

Mahama had promised torenegotiate the termsof the IMF programme during campaigns, but his government has rowed back on that pledge.

https://www.reuters.com/world/britain-boosts-aid-victims-sudan-conflict-conference-2025-04-14/,"Britain said the conference aimed to improve the coherence of the international response to the crisis, although Sudan's government criticised the gathering because no representative from either side of the conflict was invited.

In a statement, the conference's co-chairs called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire to end the conflict and backed the transition to a civilian-led government elected by the Sudanese people.

""The international community stressed the necessity of preventing any partition of Sudan,"" the co-chairs added. ""The participants underscored that the non-interference by outside actors remains paramount.""

The war in Sudan erupted in April 2023, sparked by a power struggle between the army and Sudan's Rapid Support Forces, shattering hopes for a transition to civilian rule.

It has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and devastated regions like Darfur. It has also drawn in several foreign powers.

The European Union and member states pledged over 522 million euros ($592 million) to address the crisis while Britain announced an extra 120 million pounds ($158 million) in aid.

British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the international community had to persuade the warring parties to protect civilians and let aid in, and he hoped the conference would establish principles for future engagement.

""We do need patient diplomacy,"" he told delegates at the start of the conference. ""We cannot resign ourselves to inevitable conflict. We cannot be back here, one year from now, having the same discussion.""

Britain has co-hosted the conference with the African Union, the European Union, France and Germany. Egypt, Kenya and the United Arab Emirates are among the other attendees.

Sudan's foreign minister has complained to Lammy, saying Sudan should have been invited, while criticising the presence of the United Arab Emirates and Kenya.

Sudan accuses the UAE of arming the RSF, a charge that U.N. experts and U.S. lawmakers have found credible, and it has taken a case against it to the International Court of Justice in the Hague. The UAE has denied the allegation and asked for the case to be thrown out.

Sudan also recalled its envoy to Kenya after it hosted talks between the RSF and its allies to form a parallel government.

Lana Nusseibeh, assistant minister for Political Affairs at the UAE's foreign ministry, said both sides were committing atrocities and aid was being deliberately blocked.

""As Sudan's devastating war enters its third year, the United Arab Emirates issues an urgent call for peace,"" she said in a statement.

Organisers hope the conference draws attention to a conflict where Britain says 30 million people desperately need aid and 12 million have been displaced.

A UN agency on Tuesday warned that rape is being used systematically as a weapon of war in Sudan.

Luca Renda, the UNDP Resident Representative in Sudan, told reporters there was hope for ""a more co-ordinated and coherent approach of the international community,"" adding ""Sudanese people are tired of this war.""

""The greatest humanitarian catastrophe of our time is unfolding before the eyes of the world,"" German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.

On Tuesday, lawyers acting for Sudanese victims also submitted a 141-page dossier outlining alleged war crimes committed by the RSF to the UK police's special war crimes unit, with a request to pass the file to the International Criminal Court, which has jurisdiction over atrocity crimes in Darfur.

""The Oman talks are one of dozens of tasks for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"" the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said in his meeting with	a group of high-ranking officials from three branches of the Iranian government on Tuesday.

The Leader of the Islamic Revolution also said that	the country's issues must not be tied to the talks.

""We are neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic about these talks,""	Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said while referring to the first round of indirect negotiations between Tehran and Washington in Oman on Saturday.

After all, it is a decision and a move that has been made and has been implemented well in the first steps, the	Leader noted.

He continued, ""Of course, we are very pessimistic about the other side, but we are optimistic about our own abilities.""

Recalling the mistakes made during the JCPOA agreement in 2015,	the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said, ""The mistake we made in the JCPOA should not be repeated.""

""During the JCPOA, we conditioned the country and made everything dependent on the progress of the negotiations,"" he said.

""Investors will not invest when they see that the country is dependent on	negotiation,"" he underlined.

“The negotiations may or may not yield results. We are neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic about them. Of course, we are very skeptical of the other party, but confident in our own capabilities,” the Leader said.

“The removal of the sanctions is not in our hands, but neutralizing them is; there are many ways and [there is] great domestic capacity to do that. If this objective is achieved, the country will become impervious to sanctions,” the Leader said.

Ayatollah Khamenei said the first steps in the current talks with the United States have proceeded satisfactorily. He urged officials to continue the negotiations with similar care hereafter.

The remarks came after Iran and the US held talks in the Omani capital last Saturday, with Oman's foreign minister functioning as the mediator, according to Press TV.

The Islamic Republic has asserted that the talks were solely aimed at addressing the US’s illegal and unilateral sanctions against the country, and various aspects of the Iranian nuclear energy program, strongly rejecting speculation about the process’s involving other issues.

The United States lifted some of the sanctions as per the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a historical 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers. Washington, however, returned the bans three years after conclusion of the deal, and even began piling up more coercive measures on the Islamic Republic. The US has termed the adversarial approach as “maximum pressure,” which has also seen American officials’ repeatedly threatening to use military force against the Iranian soil.

The Islamic Republic has, meanwhile, underscored that any direct negotiations with the US were neither useful nor acceptable for Tehran as long as Washington retained its hostile policies.

https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html,"Beijing has suspended exports of certain rare earth minerals and magnets that are crucial for the world’s car, semiconductor and aerospace industries.

ByKeith Bradsher

Keith Bradsher, who has covered the rare earth metals industry since 2009, reported from mines and factories in Longnan and Ganzhou, China.

China has suspended exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets, threatening to choke off supplies of components central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world.

Shipments of the magnets, essential for assembling everything from cars and drones to robots and missiles, have been halted at many Chinese ports while the Chinese government drafts a new regulatory system. Once in place, the new system could permanently prevent supplies from reaching certain companies, including American military contractors.

The official crackdown is part of China’s retaliation for President Trump’s sharp increase in tariffs that started on April 2.

On April 4, the Chinese government ordered restrictions on the export of six heavy rare earth metals, which are refined entirely in China, as well as rare earth magnets, 90 percent of which are produced in China. The metals, and special magnets made with them, can now be shipped out of China only with special export licenses.

But China has barely started setting up a system for issuing the licenses. That has caused consternation among industry executives that the process could drag on and that current supplies of minerals and products outside of China could run low.

If factories in Detroit and elsewhere run out of powerful rare earth magnets, that could prevent them from assembling cars and other products with electric motors that require these magnets. Companies vary widely in the size of their emergency stockpiles for such contingencies, so the timing of production disruptions is hard to predict.

The so-called heavy rare earth metals covered by the export suspension are used in magnets essential for many kinds of electric motors. These motors are crucial components of electric cars, drones, robots, missiles and spacecraft. Gasoline-powered cars also use electric motors with rare earth magnets for critical tasks like steering.

The metals also go into the chemicals for manufacturing jet engines, lasers, car headlights and certain spark plugs. And these rare metals are vital ingredients in capacitors, which are electrical components of the computer chips that power artificial intelligence servers and smartphones.

Michael Silver, the chairman and chief executive of American Elements, a chemicals supplier based in Los Angeles, said his company had been told it would take 45 days before export licenses could be issued and exports of rare earth metals and magnets would resume. Mr. Silver said that his company had increased its inventory last winter in anticipation of a trade war between the United States and China, and could meet its existing contracts while waiting for the licenses.

Daniel Pickard, the chairman of the critical minerals advisory committee for the Office of the United States Trade Representative and Department of Commerce, expressed concern about the availability of rare earths.

“Does the export control or ban potentially have severe effects in the U.S.? Yes,” he said. Mr. Pickard, leader of the international trade and national security practice at the Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney law firm,said a swift resolution of the rare earths issue was necessary because a sustained disruption of exports could hurt China’s reputation as a reliable supplier.

In a potential complication, China’s Ministry of Commerce, which issued the new export restrictions jointly with the General Administration of Customs, has barred Chinese companies from having any dealings with an ever-lengthening list of American companies, particularly military contractors.

One American mining leader, James Litinsky, the executive chairman and chief executive of MP Materials, said that rare earth supplies for military contractors were of particular concern.

“Drones and robotics are widely considered the future of warfare, and based on everything we are seeing, the critical inputs for our future supply chain are shut down,” he said. MP Materials owns the sole rare earths mine in the United States, the Mountain Pass mine in the California desert near the Nevada border, and hopes to start commercial production of magnets in Texas at the end of the year for General Motors and other manufacturers.

A few Japanese companies keep rare earth inventories of more than a year’s supply, having been hurt in 2010, when China imposed a seven-week embargo on rare earth exports to Japan during a territorial dispute.

But many American companies keep little or no inventory because they do not want to tie up cash in stockpiles of costly materials. One of the metals subject to the new controls, dysprosium oxide, trades for $204 per kilogram in Shanghai, and much more outside China.

Rare earth magnets make up a tiny share of China’s overall exports to the United States and elsewhere. So halting shipments causes minimal economic pain in China while holding the potential for big effects in the United States and elsewhere.

Chinese customs officials are blocking exports of heavy rare earth metals and magnets not just to the United States but to any country, including Japan and Germany. Enforcement of the new export license requirement, though, has been uneven so far among different Chinese ports, rare earth industry executives said.

Most but not all rare earth magnets include heavy rare earths, which are needed to prevent magnets from losing their magnetism at high temperatures or in some electrical fields. Some rare earth magnets are made only from light rare earths, and are not subject to export restrictions. Customs officials at a few Chinese ports are tolerating exports of magnets if they have only tiny traces of heavy rare earth metals in them, and if the magnets are not going to the United States.

Officials at other Chinese ports are taking a more stringent stance, however, demanding that exporters run tests to prove that any batch of magnets does not have heavy rare earth metals in them before the magnets can be loaded on a ship for export.

The Chinese export restrictions began taking effect before the Trump administration announced on Friday night that it would exempt many kinds of consumer electronics from China from its latest tariffs. Magnet exports continue to be blocked this weekend, five rare earth industry executives said.

Like most goods from China, the magnets are also subject to President Trump’s latest tariffs when they arrive at American ports.

Until 2023, China produced 99 percent of the world’s supply of heavy rare earth metals, with a trickle of production coming out of a refinery in Vietnam. But that refinery has been closed for the past year because of a tax dispute, leaving China with a monopoly.

China also produces 90 percent of the world’s nearly 200,000 tons a year of rare earth magnets, which are far more powerful than conventional iron magnets. Japan produces most of the rest and Germany produces a tiny quantity as well, but they depend on China for the raw materials.

China’s Ministry of Commerce did not reply to a request for comment.

The world’s richest deposits of heavy rare earths lie in a small, forested valley on the outskirts of Longnan in the red clay hills of Jiangxi Province in south-central China. And most of China’s refineries and magnet factories are in or near Longnan and Ganzhou, a town about 80 miles away. Mines in the valley ship ore to refineries in Longnan, which remove contaminants and send the rare earths to magnet factories in Ganzhou.

China’s most famous factory for these magnets is operated by the JL Mag Rare-Earth Company, whose headquarters are in Ganzhou.

The factory supplies the world’s top two electric car producers, Tesla and China’s BYD, with the magnets that power their cars, rare earth industry executives said. BYD has said that it buys some of the world’s latest, most powerful magnets from JL Mag, with 15 times the magnetic force per cubic inch of volume as a conventional iron magnet.

Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, made a special inspection visit to JL Mag’s factory in Ganzhou in 2019, during heightened trade tensions in Mr. Trump’s first term. The trip was interpreted as a hint that China was ready to use its control over the materials to disrupt American supply chains, a step it did not take then but is doing now.

China paused the mining of heavy rare earths near Longnan a few years ago because it was causing severe chemical pollution.

On Friday, at the site of one mine near Longnan, a diesel generator was humming and liquids were gurgling through plastic pipes, indicating that at least some mining operations had probably resumed. Heavy rare earths are mined by dumping strong chemicals into holes dug in the top of a hillside. The chemicals dissolve the ore and dribble out of the base of the hill, where they can be pumped to nearby pits for initial processing.

The Lebanese government has made a decision that ""weapons will only be in the hands of the state,"" but there are ""discussions around how to implement this decision,"" Aoun said in an interview with Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera.

Those discussions are in the form of a ""bilateral dialogue"" between the presidency and Hezbollah, he said.

Lebanon has been under pressure by the United States to speed up the disarmament of Hezbollah but there are fears within Lebanon that forcing the issue could lead to civil conflict.

""Civil peace is a red line for me,"" Aoun said.

Aoun said the Lebanese army — of which he was formerly commander — is ""doing its duty"" in confiscating weapons and dismantling unauthorized military facilities in southern Lebanon, as outlined in the ceasefire agreement that ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in late November, and sometimes in areas farther north.

https://on.ft.com/43PNevH,"Brussels is exploring legal options that would allow European companies to break long-term Russian gas contracts without paying hefty penalties to Moscow. 

The European Commission has been studying the contracts and the possibility of declaring force majeure, which would allow importers to exit their obligations without paying additional fees, said three officials with knowledge of the plan.

“If the whole idea is not paying Russia, then [paying compensation] would undermine the whole purpose,” one EU official said.

The move highlights the EU’s struggle to wean itself off Russian energy and deprive the Kremlin of revenues for its war in Ukraine. Moscow’s gas now makes up 11 per cent of the bloc’s supplies via pipeline, compared with almost two-fifths in 2022, but volumes of Russian liquefied natural gas have increased rapidly in the past three years.

Commission lawyers are exploring legal options as part of a road map on how the bloc will rid itself of Russian fossil fuels by 2027. The plan comes at a critical time for the EU as it also tries to present an energy deal to the US to counter President Donald Trump’s tariff regime.

The commission declined to comment.

The US is the bloc’s biggest supplier of LNG and is seen as an obvious replacement for any further reduction in Russian fuel.

The EU paid €21.9bn to Russia for oil and gas between February 2024 and February 2025, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

Unlike Russian coal, gas has not been subject to an import ban, while the EU has prohibited 90 per cent of oil imports from Moscow. Imports of the country’s shipped gas increased about 60 per cent over the past three years, but total Russian gas exports to the bloc are still the lowest since 2022.

The road map — originally meant to be published in March — has been delayed in part because of concerns that any ensuing legislation would be blocked by Hungary and Slovakia, which now account for most of the remaining piped gas still flowing into the EU.

Hungary’s pro-Russia government has threatened that it would reject gas sanctions, which need unanimous approval from the EU’s 27 member states.

The road map has also been pushed back because of early discussions over the future of the Nord Stream pipeline connecting Germany and Russia, which have been revived amid US efforts to find a rapprochement to end the Ukraine war, and the inclusion of gas purchases in trade talks with the Trump administration.

“It’s a mess,” one EU diplomat said. “How does the US fit in all this? How do we diversify?”

Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, however, told the Financial Times the plan should be published in “three to four weeks”.

Despite pressure from Brussels, EU nations are wary of forcing companies to cut LNG contracts with Russia amid concerns that it will push up prices when companies are struggling with geopolitical turmoil and high costs.

The commission gave member states powers to prevent Russian and Belarusian operators hooking up LNG to port infrastructure or sending their gas through EU pipes, but ministers have complained that this does not give them strong enough legal means to force companies to break their contracts.

The complexity for the commission’s lawyers is that contracts are secret and tend to differ. Using the war in Ukraine to call force majeure may not be legally sufficient, one EU official said.

France, Spain and Belgium’s ports are the main import hubs for Russian LNG. Moscow’s Yamal LNG plant still holds contracts with some of the EU’s biggest energy companies, including Shell and Naturgy.

Brussels-based think-tank Bruegel this month argued in favour of tariffs rather than a full ban on Russian gas imports, noting that the former would generate revenue for the EU and force Russian suppliers to lower prices to remain competitive. Unlike sanctions, tariffs only require a majority of EU member states to back them in order to be approved.

“An effective common tool on Russian gas imports is urgently needed — as otherwise Russia might again use (the prospect of) selective gas supplies to fuel profound discord among member states,” it wrote.

The Harbin public security bureau said that the three operatives -- Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson -- had been engaged in cyberattacks targeting the Asian Winter Games held in the city in February.

Investigations by Chinese technical teams revealed that the cyberattacks were carried out by the Office of Tailored Access Operations of the NSA. To conceal the origins of its attacks and secure its cyber weapons, the office used multiple affiliated front organizations to purchase IP addresses from various countries and anonymously rented servers located in regions including Europe and Asia.

Investigations revealed that the NSA focused its pre-event cyberattacks on critical systems of the Asian Winter Games, including registration, arrival/departure management, and competition entry platforms, authorities said. These systems, essential for pre-event operations, stored vast amounts of sensitive personal data of individuals associated with the Games.

From Feb 3, coinciding with the first ice hockey match, NSA cyberattacks peaked, primarily targeting critical operational systems such as the event's official information platforms. These systems were vital for ensuring the smooth running of the Games, and the NSA attempted to disrupt them to undermine their normal operations.

Meanwhile, the NSA launched cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in Heilongjiang province, including energy, transportation, water resources, telecommunications, and defense research institutions, authorities said.

Technical teams also discovered that during the Asian Winter Games, the NSA transmitted unknown encrypted data packets to specific devices running Microsoft Windows operating systems within the province. These packets are suspected to have been attempts to activate or trigger pre-implanted backdoors in the Windows systems, authorities added.

Further investigations revealed that the three NSA operatives had repeatedly launched cyberattacks against China's critical information infrastructure and participated in cyber operations targeting companies such as Huawei.

Technical teams also uncovered evidence implicating the University of California and Virginia Tech in the coordinated cyber campaign against the Asian Winter Games, authorities stated.

""We plan to draw up a supplementary budget in the 12 trillion-won range, which is about 2 trillion won more than previously proposed, after taking into account various opinions from the National Assembly and media,"" Choi said during a meeting with economy-related ministers.

The government had earlier proposed the supplementary budget to address what Choi described as the ""most pressing issues,"" including recovery efforts following recent wildfires that devastated southeastern regions of the country.

The proposal also comes amid heightened trade tensions, exacerbated by the United States' imposition of reciprocal tariffs, including a 25 percent duty for South Korea.

Choi said the revised budget will allocate more than 3 trillion won for natural disaster response, more than 4 trillion won to address changes in the global trade environment and another 4 trillion won to support small businesses and vulnerable groups.

He also underscored the need for continued cooperation with the National Assembly, highlighting the urgency of the proposal.

""Timing is of the essence when it comes to supplementary budgets,"" Choi said, urging bipartisan support for the swift passage of the bill.

Ahn's expected trip comes as Seoul seeks an exemption from the U.S.' global tariffs, including a 25 percent duty on South Korea, which the Trump administration put on hold last week for 90 days except for China.

""Depending on how the schedule is coordinated, the timing could be somewhat adjusted,"" a government official told Yonhap News Agency. ""A trip to the U.S. could happen as early as next week.""

Earlier Monday, acting President Han Duck-soo said the government would organize a negotiating team centered around Ahn to push for negotiations with U.S. officials at an early date.

Ahn visited the U.S. in February and March, and met key officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, for talks on industrial cooperation, such as in the shipbuilding sector.

Ahn's forthcoming trip is expected to focus on requesting U.S. officials to ease or exempt South Korea from the reciprocal tariffs, and explain Seoul's efforts to resolve non-tariff barriers that Washington takes issue with.
