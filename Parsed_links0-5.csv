In the second half of the 20th century, the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains began shrinking, and rainfall became more variable. Over the past 20 years, a new normal has emerged: a more arid climate, one in which drought and wildfires are worsening and becoming more frequent. That change can be explained by climate change, which is causing the planet to warm, drying out vegetation and creating ideal conditions for wildfires. Here’s a look at the science. Higher temperatures dry out forests and grasslands. The planet is warming because of greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas. Climate change has led to hotter temperatures, which means more evaporation, which means that forests and grasslands are drier. That makes it easier for a fire to start and spread. For example, a study published in 2022 in the journal Nature Climate Change found that the area burned by wildfires in the western United States increased by 550 percent between 1984 and 2020 because of this drying effect. In California, forests are also more crowded than they used to be. For decades, fire suppression was the policy, which allowed trees and brush to accumulate. This creates a lot of fuel for the fires. As the climate has become hotter and drier, the vegetation has become more flammable. When fires ignite, they can burn more intensely and spread more quickly than in the past. Fire, of course, is a natural part of many ecosystems, and it serves a valuable purpose. It clears out dead trees and brush, which creates space for new growth. Many plants also need fire to reproduce. But the warming climate has made wildfires more frequent and more destructive. As a result, forests and grasslands are changing. Some forests are dying, and new types of vegetation are moving in. And with more and larger fires, many communities are struggling to deal with the increased threat.",Drought and Climate Change Are Making Wildfires Worse.
