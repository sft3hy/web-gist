https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7pqzk47zo,"Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales. The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people. The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women. The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words ""woman"" and ""sex"" are defined in the legislation. He told the court: ""The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. ""But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not."" He added that the legislation gives transgender people ""protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender"". Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears. The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including ""sex"" and ""gender reassignment"". Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by ""sex"" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, ""certificated"" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex ""for all purposes"". For Women Scotland argued for a ""common sense"" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an ""immutable biological state"". Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: ""Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex. ""Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling."" First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement. Heposted on social media: ""The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster. ""We will now engage on the implications of the ruling."" Swinney added: ""Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions."" A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted ""in good faith"" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement. A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring ""clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs"". ""Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,"" the spokesman added. Conservative leader Kemi Badenochdescribed the rulingas a ""victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious"". She added: ""It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so."" Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: ""It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK."" But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: ""This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society. ""It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next."" For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups. Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender. Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was ""shocked"" by the court ruling, arguing that it ""reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates"". They added: ""This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services. ""It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody."" The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy overtransgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prisonand an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse whoobjected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room. NHS Fife said it would ""carefully consider"" the court's judgement. The judges ruled that interpreting sex as ""certificated"" rather than ""biological"" would ""cut across the definitions of man and ""woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way"". They said a ""certified"" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian. The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to ""function coherently"". It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions. The judges noted ""similar confusion and impracticability"" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces. The judges added: ""The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct."" Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender. However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs ""if it is proportionate to do so"". Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman. He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex. But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be ""settled"" by this court case. He told the BBC: ""It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them."" Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a ""reassessment"" of rules. The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards. For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law. The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts. Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was ""not limited to biological or birth sex"". The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex. The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers. Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

https://www.riotimesonline.com/venezuela-keeps-oil-output-above-one-million-barrels-in-march-opec-reports/,"Venezuela kept its crude oil production above one million barrels per day in March, according to the latest OPEC report. The country produced 1,048,000 barrels per day, up by 23,000 from February. This figure comes from direct sources, including Venezuela’s state oil company. Secondary sources, such as independent industry analysts, reported a lower figure of 911,000 barrels per day for March. Both numbers show a clear increase compared to the same period last year. The average production for the first quarter of 2025 reached 1,034,667 barrels per day, a 19.75% rise over the previous year. The price of Venezuela’s main crude blend, Merey, dropped to $61.10 per barrel in March from $64.96 in February. This price remains below global benchmarks, reflecting the heavier quality of Venezuelan crude and the challenges in marketing it. Oil exports remain Venezuela’s main source of foreign currency. Since 2017, production has dropped sharply. Venezuelan officials blame U.S. sanctions for this decline. These sanctions have limited Venezuela’s access to international markets and technology. The country’s oil sector saw a partial recovery after the U.S. relaxed some sanctions in late 2022. This allowed companies like Chevron to resume operations and export oil. Chevron’s involvement has been significant, accounting for about a quarter of Venezuela’s total oil production. However, the U.S. government recently replaced Chevron’s license with a more restrictive one. This change requires Chevron to wind down its operations by late May. Other international companies, such as Eni and Repsol, also face new restrictions. These firms together contribute around 300,000 barrels per day to Venezuela’s output. Analysts warn that without these foreign partners, Venezuela’s production could fall below 720,000 barrels per day. The government is seeking new deals with countries like China and Turkey. Officials have announced a plan to boost domestic investment and technology. However, the sector faces technical and financial challenges. Venezuela’s oil industry stands at a crossroads. The country’s ability to maintain or grow output depends on new investment and access to markets. The next months will show if Venezuela can keep its oil sector afloat or face another decline.

https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-france-emmanuel-macron-recognizing-palestine-warning-terrorism/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday that recognizing Palestine as a state would be a victory for Hamas and Iran. During a phone call with Macron on Tuesday, Netanyahu “expressed fierce opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state, and said that this would constitute a huge prize for terrorism,” his office said in a statement. According to the Israeli leader, “a Palestinian state established a few minutes away from Israeli cities would become an Iranian stronghold of terrorism,” his office said. Last Wednesday, Macron said France could recognize a Palestinian state in the coming months. “I’m not doing it for unity, or to please this or that person. I’m doing it because at some point it will be fair,” Macron said during an	interview with a French broadcaster. Israel has waged war on Hamas in Gaza since October 2023, after the militant group carried out a violent attack on Israeli soil and took hostages to the coastal enclave. The Israeli military has reportedly killed more than 50,000 people in its retaliatory assault. As of now, Israel controls about a third of Gaza, with ceasefire talks ongoing but stalled over key demands.

https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html,"China has suspended exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets, threatening to choke off supplies of components central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world. Shipments of the magnets, essential for assembling everything from cars and drones to robots and missiles, have been halted at many Chinese ports while the Chinese government drafts a new regulatory system. Once in place, the new system could permanently prevent supplies from reaching certain companies, including American military contractors. The official crackdown is part of China’s retaliation for President Trump’s sharp increase in tariffs that started on April 2. On April 4, the Chinese government ordered restrictions on the export of six heavy rare earth metals, which are refined entirely in China, as well as rare earth magnets, 90 percent of which are produced in China. The metals, and special magnets made with them, can now be shipped out of China only with special export licenses. But China has barely started setting up a system for issuing the licenses. That has caused consternation among industry executives that the process could drag on and that current supplies of minerals and products outside of China could run low. If factories in Detroit and elsewhere run out of powerful rare earth magnets, that could prevent them from assembling cars and other products with electric motors that require these magnets. Companies vary widely in the size of their emergency stockpiles for such contingencies, so the timing of production disruptions is hard to predict. The so-called heavy rare earth metals covered by the export suspension are used in magnets essential for many kinds of electric motors. These motors are crucial components of electric cars, drones, robots, missiles and spacecraft. Gasoline-powered cars also use electric motors with rare earth magnets for critical tasks like steering. The metals also go into the chemicals for manufacturing jet engines, lasers, car headlights and certain spark plugs. And these rare metals are vital ingredients in capacitors, which are electrical components of the computer chips that power artificial intelligence servers and smartphones. Michael Silver, the chairman and chief executive of American Elements, a chemicals supplier based in Los Angeles, said his company had been told it would take 45 days before export licenses could be issued and exports of rare earth metals and magnets would resume. Mr. Silver said that his company had increased its inventory last winter in anticipation of a trade war between the United States and China, and could meet its existing contracts while waiting for the licenses. Daniel Pickard, the chairman of the critical minerals advisory committee for the Office of the United States Trade Representative and Department of Commerce, expressed concern about the availability of rare earths. “Does the export control or ban potentially have severe effects in the U.S.? Yes,” he said. Mr. Pickard, leader of the international trade and national security practice at the Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney law firm,said a swift resolution of the rare earths issue was necessary because a sustained disruption of exports could hurt China’s reputation as a reliable supplier. In a potential complication, China’s Ministry of Commerce, which issued the new export restrictions jointly with the General Administration of Customs, has barred Chinese companies from having any dealings with an ever-lengthening list of American companies, particularly military contractors. One American mining leader, James Litinsky, the executive chairman and chief executive of MP Materials, said that rare earth supplies for military contractors were of particular concern. “Drones and robotics are widely considered the future of warfare, and based on everything we are seeing, the critical inputs for our future supply chain are shut down,” he said. MP Materials owns the sole rare earths mine in the United States, the Mountain Pass mine in the California desert near the Nevada border, and hopes to start commercial production of magnets in Texas at the end of the year for General Motors and other manufacturers. A few Japanese companies keep rare earth inventories of more than a year’s supply, having been hurt in 2010, when China imposed a seven-week embargo on rare earth exports to Japan during a territorial dispute. But many American companies keep little or no inventory because they do not want to tie up cash in stockpiles of costly materials. One of the metals subject to the new controls, dysprosium oxide, trades for $204 per kilogram in Shanghai, and much more outside China. Rare earth magnets make up a tiny share of China’s overall exports to the United States and elsewhere. So halting shipments causes minimal economic pain in China while holding the potential for big effects in the United States and elsewhere. Chinese customs officials are blocking exports of heavy rare earth metals and magnets not just to the United States but to any country, including Japan and Germany. Enforcement of the new export license requirement, though, has been uneven so far among different Chinese ports, rare earth industry executives said. Most but not all rare earth magnets include heavy rare earths, which are needed to prevent magnets from losing their magnetism at high temperatures or in some electrical fields. Some rare earth magnets are made only from light rare earths, and are not subject to export restrictions. Customs officials at a few Chinese ports are tolerating exports of magnets if they have only tiny traces of heavy rare earth metals in them, and if the magnets are not going to the United States. Officials at other Chinese ports are taking a more stringent stance, however, demanding that exporters run tests to prove that any batch of magnets does not have heavy rare earth metals in them before the magnets can be loaded on a ship for export. The Chinese export restrictions began taking effect before the Trump administration announced on Friday night that it would exempt many kinds of consumer electronics from China from its latest tariffs. Magnet exports continue to be blocked this weekend, five rare earth industry executives said. Like most goods from China, the magnets are also subject to President Trump’s latest tariffs when they arrive at American ports. Until 2023, China produced 99 percent of the world’s supply of heavy rare earth metals, with a trickle of production coming out of a refinery in Vietnam. But that refinery has been closed for the past year because of a tax dispute, leaving China with a monopoly. China also produces 90 percent of the world’s nearly 200,000 tons a year of rare earth magnets, which are far more powerful than conventional iron magnets. Japan produces most of the rest and Germany produces a tiny quantity as well, but they depend on China for the raw materials. China’s Ministry of Commerce did not reply to a request for comment. The world’s richest deposits of heavy rare earths lie in a small, forested valley on the outskirts of Longnan in the red clay hills of Jiangxi Province in south-central China. And most of China’s refineries and magnet factories are in or near Longnan and Ganzhou, a town about 80 miles away. Mines in the valley ship ore to refineries in Longnan, which remove contaminants and send the rare earths to magnet factories in Ganzhou. China’s most famous factory for these magnets is operated by the JL Mag Rare-Earth Company, whose headquarters are in Ganzhou. The factory supplies the world’s top two electric car producers, Tesla and China’s BYD, with the magnets that power their cars, rare earth industry executives said. BYD has said that it buys some of the world’s latest, most powerful magnets from JL Mag, with 15 times the magnetic force per cubic inch of volume as a conventional iron magnet. Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, made a special inspection visit to JL Mag’s factory in Ganzhou in 2019, during heightened trade tensions in Mr. Trump’s first term. The trip was interpreted as a hint that China was ready to use its control over the materials to disrupt American supply chains, a step it did not take then but is doing now. China paused the mining of heavy rare earths near Longnan a few years ago because it was causing severe chemical pollution. On Friday, at the site of one mine near Longnan, a diesel generator was humming and liquids were gurgling through plastic pipes, indicating that at least some mining operations had probably resumed. Heavy rare earths are mined by dumping strong chemicals into holes dug in the top of a hillside. The chemicals dissolve the ore and dribble out of the base of the hill, where they can be pumped to nearby pits for initial processing. Li Youcontributed research.

https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/312205-presidency-hezbollah-discussing-weapons-in-bilateral-dialogue,"President Joseph Aoun said Monday that the disarmament of the militant group Hezbollah will come through negotiations as part of a national defense strategy and not through ""force.""

The Lebanese government has made a decision that ""weapons will only be in the hands of the state,"" but there are ""discussions around how to implement this decision,"" Aoun said in an interview with Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera.

Those discussions are in the form of a ""bilateral dialogue"" between the presidency and Hezbollah, he said.

Lebanon has been under pressure by the United States to speed up the disarmament of Hezbollah but there are fears within Lebanon that forcing the issue could lead to civil conflict.

""Civil peace is a red line for me,"" Aoun said.

Aoun said the Lebanese army — of which he was formerly commander — is ""doing its duty"" in confiscating weapons and dismantling unauthorized military facilities in southern Lebanon, as outlined in the ceasefire agreement that ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in late November, and sometimes in areas farther north.

https://on.ft.com/43PNevH,"Brussels is exploring legal options that would allow European companies to break long-term Russian gas contracts without paying hefty penalties to Moscow. The European Commission has been studying the contracts and the possibility of declaring force majeure, which would allow importers to exit their obligations without paying additional fees, said three officials with knowledge of the plan. “If the whole idea is not paying Russia, then [paying compensation] would undermine the whole purpose,” one EU official said. The move highlights the EU’s struggle to wean itself off Russian energy and deprive the Kremlin of revenues for its war in Ukraine. Moscow’s gas now makes up 11 per cent of the bloc’s supplies via pipeline, compared with almost two-fifths in 2022, but volumes of Russian liquefied natural gas have increased rapidly in the past three years. Commission lawyers are exploring legal options as part of a road map on how the bloc will rid itself of Russian fossil fuels by 2027. The plan comes at a critical time for the EU as it also tries to present an energy deal to the US to counter President Donald Trump’s tariff regime. The commission declined to comment. The US is the bloc’s biggest supplier of LNG and is seen as an obvious replacement for any further reduction in Russian fuel. The EU paid €21.9bn to Russia for oil and gas between February 2024 and February 2025, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Unlike Russian coal, gas has not been subject to an import ban, while the EU has prohibited 90 per cent of oil imports from Moscow. Imports of the country’s shipped gas increased about 60 per cent over the past three years, but total Russian gas exports to the bloc are still the lowest since 2022. The road map — originally meant to be published in March — has been delayed in part because of concerns that any ensuing legislation would be blocked by Hungary and Slovakia, which now account for most of the remaining piped gas still flowing into the EU. Hungary’s pro-Russia government has threatened that it would reject gas sanctions, which need unanimous approval from the EU’s 27 member states. The road map has also been pushed back because of early discussions over the future of the Nord Stream pipeline connecting Germany and Russia, which have been revived amid US efforts to find a rapprochement to end the Ukraine war, and the inclusion of gas purchases in trade talks with the Trump administration. “It’s a mess,” one EU diplomat said. “How does the US fit in all this? How do we diversify?’’ Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, however, told the Financial Times the plan should be published in “three to four weeks”. Despite pressure from Brussels, EU nations are wary of forcing companies to cut LNG contracts with Russia amid concerns that it will push up prices when companies are struggling with geopolitical turmoil and high costs. The commission gave member states powers to prevent Russian and Belarusian operators hooking up LNG to port infrastructure or sending their gas through EU pipes, but ministers have complained that this does not give them strong enough legal means to force companies to break their contracts. The complexity for the commission’s lawyers is that contracts are secret and tend to differ. Using the war in Ukraine to call force majeure may not be legally sufficient, one EU official said. France, Spain and Belgium’s ports are the main import hubs for Russian LNG. Moscow’s Yamal LNG plant still holds contracts with some of the EU’s biggest energy companies, including Shell and Naturgy. Brussels-based think-tank Bruegel this month argued in favour of tariffs rather than a full ban on Russian gas imports, noting that the former would generate revenue for the EU and force Russian suppliers to lower prices to remain competitive. Unlike sanctions, tariffs only require a majority of EU member states to back them in order to be approved. “An effective common tool on Russian gas imports is urgently needed — as otherwise Russia might again use (the prospect of) selective gas supplies to fuel profound discord among member states,” it wrote.",EU explores legal options for ending Russian gas deals,"Alice Hancock, Andy Bounds",Financial Times,2025-04-15T00:00:46,2025-04-15T15:53:59,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202504/15/WS67fdb2cda3104d9fd381f49b.html,"HARBIN -- Police authorities in Harbin, in Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, said on Tuesday that they are pursuing three operatives affiliated with the US National Security Agency (NSA) over suspected cyberattacks against China. The Harbin public security bureau said that the three operatives -- Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson -- had been engaged in cyberattacks targeting the Asian Winter Games held in the city in February. Investigations by Chinese technical teams revealed that the cyberattacks were carried out by the Office of Tailored Access Operations of the NSA. To conceal the origins of its attacks and secure its cyber weapons, the office used multiple affiliated front organizations to purchase IP addresses from various countries and anonymously rented servers located in regions including Europe and Asia. Investigations revealed that the NSA focused its pre-event cyberattacks on critical systems of the Asian Winter Games, including registration, arrival/departure management, and competition entry platforms, authorities said. These systems, essential for pre-event operations, stored vast amounts of sensitive personal data of individuals associated with the Games. From Feb 3, coinciding with the first ice hockey match, NSA cyberattacks peaked, primarily targeting critical operational systems such as the event's official information platforms. These systems were vital for ensuring the smooth running of the Games, and the NSA attempted to disrupt them to undermine their normal operations. Meanwhile, the NSA launched cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in Heilongjiang province, including energy, transportation, water resources, telecommunications, and defense research institutions, authorities said. Technical teams also discovered that during the Asian Winter Games, the NSA transmitted unknown encrypted data packets to specific devices running Microsoft Windows operating systems within the province. These packets are suspected to have been attempts to activate or trigger pre-implanted backdoors in the Windows systems, authorities added.

https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/new-armed-extremist-group-claims-responsibility-bombing-greeces-120770871,"A new extremist group has claimed responsibility for a bomb that exploded near the offices of Hellenic Train, Greece’s main railway services operator, and the planting of another near the Labor Ministry in early February ATHENS, Greece --A new extremist group claimed responsibility Sunday for a bomb that exploded near the offices of Hellenic Train, Greece’s main railway services operator and the planting of another near the Labor Ministry in early February. The explosion Friday evening resulted in limited damage and no injuries. The perpetrators had forewarned of the explosion by calling two media organizations about 40 minutes before it happened. In a lengthy posting on the website Athens.indymedia.org on Sunday, the perpetrators, who styled themselves the Revolutionary Class Struggle, explained the reasons for their action, which they said was part of an armed struggle against the state. Revolutionary Class Struggle dedicated the bombings to “the Palestinian people and their heroic resistance” and paid tribute to Kyriakos Xymitiris, a man who was killed last year when the explosive device he was assembling exploded in a central Athens apartment. The explosion also came during widespread public anger over a 2023 railway disaster, Greece’s worst, in which 57 people were killed and dozens more injured when a freight train and a passenger train heading in opposite directions were accidentally put on the same track. The deadly accident exposed severe deficiencies in Greece’s railway system, including in safety systems, and has triggered mass protests led by relatives of the victims against the country’s conservative government on the occasion of the accident’s second anniversary. In its statement, which serves as a sort of manifesto, Revolutionary Class Struggle connects the accident with what it called the “murders” of the proletariat in the form of workplace accidents, by capitalists. Greece has a long history of politically motivated violence dating back to the 1970s, with domestic extremist groups carrying out small-scale bombings that usually cause damage but rarely lead to injuries. While the groups most active in the 1980s and 1990s have been dismantled, new smaller groups have emerged. Authorities are calling them a new generation of domestic extremists. “With the blood not yet dry, they attributed the (train) accident to human error and the ‘chronic deficiencies of the Greek state,’ in effect demanding even more freedom of movement for capital, more privatizations and new attacks on any remaining state-owned infrastructure,” the extremist group said. Hellenic Train, the operator of passenger and cargo train services, was once a subsidiary of state-owned Hellenic Railways. It was split and sold to Italy’s Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane in 2017. Hellenic Railways retains ownership and responsibility for the maintenance of the rail infrastructure, including the train stations. Police say they are following leads, including images of one or two individuals on security cameras and possible cellphone conversations. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",Armed extremist group claims responsibility for bombing near Greece rail headquarters,DEMETRIS NELLAS Associated Press,ABC News,2025-04-13T16:33:51,2025-04-13T17:03:11,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/04/13/2003835086,"State-owned oil refiner CPC Corp, Taiwan (CPC, 台灣中油) plans to boost its procurement of US energy products — including liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil — in response to US President Donald Trump’s 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese exports, sources said yesterday. President William Lai (賴清德) has said the government intends to expand purchases of US goods, including agricultural, industrial, and energy products, as part of its strategy to narrow the trade balance. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said it aims for US-sourced LNG to account for 30 percent of Taiwan’s total LNG imports. Last year, US LNG made up 10 percent of CPC’s imports, with the company sourcing from 14 different countries, the ministry said. CPC sources said the target could be met by ramping up existing LNG imports from the US or seeking new supply channels, such as LNG from Alaska.  The company said it has inked a term sheet with select US firms certifying its intent to import LNG from Alaska, although the project could take five to seven years to come online. The company said that major US energy firms maintain diversified global investments and that it has an understanding with its partners to adjust delivery volumes based on demand and evolving circumstances. It also said it confirmed it would significantly increase LNG imports from the US over the next four years. It also plans to raise its purchases of US crude oil to help ensure a stable energy supply for the country. The company said it primarily imports sweet crude oil, or crude with a lower sulfur content, from the US and African countries, adding that sweet crude, while more expensive, was more environmentally friendly.  It is also importing sour crude, or crude with higher sulfur content, from the Middle East, it added.  While the company had been considering scaling back US sweet crude imports due to declining domestic demand for gasoline and diesel, it is now reassessing that decision in light of the government’s push for net-zero emissions and broader energy diversification policies. US-sourced crude has already increased from 44 percent to 60 percent of CPC’s total imports over the past three years. The rise was partly due to a fire at the company’s Dalin refinery’s heavy oil desulfurization unit on Oct. 27, 2022.  The Dalin facility has since been repaired and is expected to resume operations shortly, CPC said.",CPC to boost LNG imports to narrow trade balance,Liu Ching-hua and Jake Chung,taipeitimes.com,2025-04-13T00:00:00,2025-04-13T00:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2025-04-12/eu-joint-defense-fund/,"Warsaw, Apr 12 (EFE).— Spain on Saturday proposed the creation of a new European financial instrument to fast-track large-scale defense projects, aiming to reduce EU reliance on US military support and respond swiftly to mounting security challenges. The plan, presented during an informal meeting of EU finance ministers in Warsaw, would also allow non-EU countries to participate, aiming to boost European defense spending in the short term. Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo outlined the proposal as a way to strengthen the EU’s autonomy in defense, particularly in light of the United States’ shifting stance under President Donald Trump regarding Ukraine and NATO contributions. “The proposal aims not only to increase defense spending immediately but also to use resources more efficiently by coordinating Europe’s security needs,” Cuerpo said. He described the fund as a “transitional solution” to expedite defense investments until more permanent financing, such as incorporating defense into the EU’s long-term budget, is in place. A Swift, Temporary Mechanism The proposed instrument would take the form of a temporary special-purpose entity, open not only to EU member states. It would be funded through voluntary contributions from participating countries, with the exact formula for contributions yet to be determined. The fund would support grants and loans for large-scale defense projects, complementing other EU financing sources, such as common debt issuance under existing or new programs. The Spanish Ministry of Economy also suggested tapping into the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone’s rescue fund with €400 billion in lending capacity, and leveraging the windfall earnings from around €200 billion in frozen Russian assets held in the EU. Spain argues that this new instrument could be established more quickly than long-term solutions like increasing the EU’s multi-annual financial framework, another proposal Madrid supports but acknowledges would take years to implement. “This is the moment for European solidarity…to support Ukraine and frontline Eastern nations. We must invest together in defense, which is a genuine European public good that benefits our citizens and strengthens our economic security,” Cuerpo said. Backing From Brussels and Beyond Spain’s initiative complements the European Commission’s proposed rearmament strategy, which includes loosening fiscal rules to boost defense spending, potentially mobilizing €650 billion over four years, and a €150 billion loan instrument funded through common debt issuance. European Commissioner for the Economy Valdis Dombrovskis welcomed the Spanish proposal, saying the commission is “ready to explore new options.” He noted that the Spanish proposal aligns with ongoing discussions among EU member states, including recognizing defense as a European public good and addressing unequal security burdens across the bloc. “There is a clear awakening in Europe regarding security,” said Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domański, who hosted the meeting. “Many countries have shifted their stance compared to a year or two ago, and there is a stronger willingness to increase spending.” He praised the solidarity of southern EU nations with their Eastern and Central European counterparts and said a majority of member states now support finding new financing mechanisms. Domański also stressed the urgency of reaching agreement on the commission’s proposed the Security Action For Europe (SAFE) instrument by May, and encouraged EU countries to request flexibility in fiscal rules by the end of April so that adjustments can be approved by July and enable higher defense spending.

https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-war-recruitment-soars-with-record-bonuses/33383051.html,"Russian recruitment for men to fight in Ukraine is soaring in many of the country's regions, with signing bonuses and other incentives reaching new records in some places. In Siberian regions like Irkutsk and Novosibirsk, local authorities have aggressively pushed contracts on potential volunteers, and signing bonuses in some places exceed average annual salaries, according to recruits and official advertising campaigns. Sergei, who asked that his real name not be used and that his specific town in the Irkutsk region not be disclosed, said that, when he showed up at a recruiting office, he was immediately shown into a room and handed a brochure with ""big, red figure"" on the front: 1.4 million rubles ($16,700). ""It's supposedly what they’re paying you to go die. Or kill. Depends how it turns out, I guess,""he told RFE/RL's Siberia Realities. Russian officials have not released casualty figures since 2022, butWestern estimates put the number of Russian soldiers killed or woundedsince the start of the all-out invasion in February 2022 at more than 790,000. The bulk of those casualties have occurred as a result of the battlefield tactics that Russian commanders have relied on: front infantry assaults, sometimes on foot, sometimes on motorcycles, that seek to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses. To replenish personnel, authorities have relied heavily on extraordinarily high wages and benefits to attract volunteers to fight in Ukraine. The signing bonuses typically are a mix of federal and local payments. Authorities in Moscow have also pressured regional leaders to meet quotas for new volunteers. In Iskitim, a town near the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, a woman who asked to be called Galina said she visited her local recruiting office on behalf of her nephew, who had previously been rejected for medical reasons. She said the recruiter pushed her to bring him to the enlistment office -- not just pass along the brochures to him. “I told her I’d think about it,” she said. “They’re taking everyone.” She said officials are offering 1.2 million ruble signing bonuses ($14,300), but they're also highlighting a monthly salary for fighting in the war: starting at 210,000 rubles ($2,500). ""Then they keep adding numbers, trying to make it sound as good as it did in late 2024,"" she said. ""Never mind that you could die in your first week."" Galina said there were two other men at the recruiting on the day she visited recently. One was seeking a ""missing-in-action"" certification for a relative, the other wanted a death certificate for his 24-year-old son, so he could claim death benefits, but he didn't have the proper proof. ""He told me, ‘Of course we’re sad about our boy. He didn’t give us any grandchildren’"",""'But now we can fix up the house and buy a new car.'"" ""That’s how much a life is worth -- even to his own family. I don’t know, maybe he was just trying to justify what had happened. Maybe it’s the only way he could cope."" Some experts have pointed to the steady increase in signing bonuses, wages, and benefits as evidence that authorities are having difficulty attracting enough recruits to keep the war going. In Yekaterinburg, a major Ural Mountain city, a woman who gave her name as Aleksandra visited a local recruiting office recently and saw a man who appeared to be close to 60 years old being referred for a medical exam. ""He said they told him it would be 'just a formality,'"" she said. Her own relative, whom she did not identify, had had heart problems and was even hospitalized in a psychiatric facility not long ago. ""They said it wasn’t a problem. And they reminded me about the bonus payments announced in mid-March,"" she said. “It felt like they had a green light to take absolutely anyone."" “I asked ‘Are people really signing up?’"" she told RFE/RL. The recruiter replied: ""'Yes. The signings have been good, especially since they increased the payout by 2 1/2 times'.” Siberia.RealitiesÂ

https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-fm-ukrainian-membership-in-nato-should-not-be-off-the-agenda/,"Ukraine’s NATO membership must remain on the international agenda, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum on April 12, stressing that Kyiv’s integration is essential for long-term transatlantic security. “This is not just about Ukraine,” Sybiha said. “This is about transatlantic security. It’s about our contribution.” He emphasized that Ukraine currently fields 110 combat-ready brigades, describing them as a “realistic, true contribution to future security — and, by the way, the cheapest one.” Sybiha also criticized Russia for violating all 10 principles of the Helsinki Final Act and highlighted the problems within the UN. “This year, we mark 80 years of the UN Charter. Why do I mention this? Because it is important that international law should be law, not simply declarations or words,” he said. He added that the global system had proven “dysfunctional” and “unjust” in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “We need new enforcement tools. We need reforms. We need reforms in the UN and, by the way, in humanitarian law — in the Geneva Conventions. We must update them, not only for Ukraine but for other countries like Syria. Having such a bitter experience, we are ready to contribute.” Addressing the ongoing war, Sybiha reaffirmed Ukraine’s desire for peace but warned against the misuse of the term. “We want to end this war this year. But it is important not to manipulate,” he said. “How this war ends will determine the future security architecture of Europe — it depends on the future security of every family in Europe,” he said. “That is why achieving a long-term and clear peace is fundamentally important.” Sybiha also condemned Russia for escalating attacks on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s commitment to a full ceasefire. “Yesterday marked exactly one month since Ukraine unconditionally supported a full ceasefire,” he said. “Instead of this, Russia has only escalated its terror,” 	Sybiha said According to the foreign minister, Russian forces have launched nearly 70 missiles, more than 2,020 Shahed drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs over the past month — most of them targeting civilian areas. “This clearly shows the world who truly wants peace and who is committed to war,” he said.",Ukrainian FM: Ukrainian membership in NATO should not be off the agenda,Anna Fratsyvir,kyivindependent.com,,,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.thetimes.com/uk/defence/article/russia-secret-war-uk-waters-submarines-dpbzphfx5,"Russian sensors suspected of attempting to spy on the UK’s nuclear submarines have been found hidden in the seas around Britain. The discovery by the British military was deemed a potential threat to national security and has never been made public. Several were found after they washed ashore, while others are understood to have been located by the Royal Navy. The devices are believed to have been planted by Moscow to try and gather intelligence on Britain’s four Vanguard submarines, which carry nuclear missiles. One of these submarines is always at sea under what is known as the UK’s continuous at-sea deterrent. The Sunday Times has chosen to withhold certain details, including the locations of the sensors. During a three-month investigation we spoke to morethan a dozen former defence ministers, senior armed forces personnel and military experts to expose how Russia is using its unrivalled underwater warfare capabilities to map, hack and potentially sabotage critical British infrastructure. We were allowed unprecedented access to the RFA Proteus, the Royal Navy’s deep-sea surveillance vessel, to witness how it is leading efforts to counter threats in domestic waters. Senior military figures liken the technological battle for supremacy below the waves to the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Now Britain has “woken up” to the Russian threat, the question is whether it is capable of catching up. At 8.45am on March 21, a black inflatable speedboat is skimming across Campbeltown Loch towards one of the most secretive vessels in the Royal Navy’s fleet. The Sunday Times has joined senior naval officers being ferried to the RFA Proteus, named after the sea god in Greek mythology, as its crew spend the week training and experimenting with cutting-edge underwater vehicles. Anchored just off Scotland’s westernmost town, the Proteus forms an imposing silhouette against the Isle of Arran, its giant helipad and deep-sea crane clearly visible from a mile away. It is the first time a journalist has been allowed to observe its capabilities since the vessel came into service in 2023. On deck, helmeted crews prepare remotely operated vehicles that later today will be lowered to the sea bed via a moon pool — an opening in the hull the size of eight snooker tables. Other, more sensitive equipment is stowed in blue metal containers. Already aboard are two dozen members of the navy’s diving and mine-hunting squadrons, experts in searching out, recovering and destroying enemy munitions on the sea bed. They are here for the first time and will become an integral part of the ship’s operations, because Britain’s critical undersea infrastructure is under unprecedented threat from a long-standing nemesis: Russia. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the might of Russia’s non-nuclear forces went with it. But according to Royal Navy insiders, Moscow never stopped investing in the submarines patrolling the murky depths of the world’s oceans. Russia is the only nation with a fleet of specialist subs for sea-bed warfare and espionage. Some surpass the capabilities of those of Britain and its Nato allies. By the time President Putin sent tanks into Ukraine three years ago,Russiahad already begun setting the stage for a much wider conflict with Nato, engaging in surveillance and sabotage of the underwater internet connections, energy pipelines and military cables that are vital to the functioning of western democracies. These activities are at the heart of Putin’s “greyzone” doctrine. The blowing up of theNord Stream gas pipelinein 2022 was the first major incident; Royal Navy insiders maintain that its “military precision” had all the hallmarks of a Kremlin greyzone operation. In the past 15 months, at least 11 internet cables in the Baltic Sea have also been damaged, some from ships dragging anchor across the sea bed. Suspicion has come to rest on Russia’s shadow fleet of ageing tankers, which are mainly used by Putin to circumvent western oil sanctions. “You really need to keep the [engine] power on to drag, so it is a deliberate act,” a defence insider said. When a cable between Estonia and Finland was damaged in December, the Joint Expeditionary Force, a group of northern European and Baltic states led by the UK, responded by activating Nordic Warden, a reaction system that uses AI to track locations of the shadow fleet. A senior serving British military figure added: “There should be no doubt, there is a war raging in the Atlantic. This is a game of cat and mouse that has continued since the ending of the Cold War, and is now heating up again. We are seeing phenomenal amounts of Russian activity.” The Russian underwater research programme is largely overseen by the Main Directorate for Deep-Sea Research (Gugi). Its best-known vessel is the spy ship Yantar, which gained notoriety last year when it appeared off the British coast. It is equipped with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and two mini-submarines capable of reaching depths of 6,000m, craft that allow the Yantar to find and map infrastructure, as well as to cut cables using manipulator arms or tap them for information. In November, the Yantar was found in the Irish Sea loitering near cables carrying data for Microsoft and Google. The Proteus was one of several vessels dispatched to monitor it – or, as a defence source describes, it show Russia “they were pissing in our backyard.” When the Yantar returned to the English Channel in January, the defence secretary John Healey authorised HMS Somerset and HMS Tyne tracked it at closer range, while HMS Astute, a nuclear-powered submarine, covertly monitored the vessel from below before surfacing alongside it. This more aggressive posture has been widely welcomed in the navy, with a senior official stating: “We’ve got to play by the rules of the game. But whereas before we were playing it nicely, now we’re being more muscular.” However, the Yantar is not where the real problem lies. The waters immediately encircling Britain sit for the most part on the European continental shelf, meaning they are seldom deeper than 300m. The navy has several ways of monitoring them and is confident it can keep tabs on Russian activity. But where the continental shelf ends, the sea bed drops thousands of metres. The Proteus is the only navy surface vessel truly capable of policing these depths, where Gugi’s most potent threat, its fleet of six-nuclear powered mini-submarines, could be lurking. The mini-subs can sit on the sea bed and have manipulator arms capable of cutting cables, laying explosives or placing taps on fibreoptic cables for hacking purposes. They are supported by two larger “mother” submarines, meaning they can be moved covertly to pretty much anywhere in the world. Russia has other capabilities. Three senior defence sources have revealed that prior to the full invasion of Ukraine, there was credible intelligence that superyachts owned by oligarchs may have been used to conduct underwater reconnaissance around Britain. Several of these vessels have moon pools that can be used covertly to deploy and retrieve deep-sea reconnaissance and diving equipment. A former minister also recounted how, in 2018, HMS Albion, an amphibious assault ship, had been forced to leave port prematurely while moored in Limassol, Cyprus. The vessel had been docked for under 24 hours when a huge superyacht belonging to an oligarch pulled up alongside it. Suspecting that it was there covertly to surveil the Albion, the navy ship “moved on quite quickly.” The Nord Stream attack highlighted the fragility of the UK’s energy supply, almost a fifth of which now comes from offshore wind farms. The electricity generated by these turbines is transported to the mainland through undersea cables. Oil and gas pipelines are also vital to Britain, particularly those ferrying gas from Norway. They could easily be severed were Russia to plant explosive devices, such as shaped charges or mines. “You cut those and you’ve lost that energy — and in the winter during high usage, that could be serious,” a senior military figure said. A second added that a co-ordinated attack could lead to a “failure of the national grid”. The 60 internet cables that connect Britain to the rest of the world are coated in plastic polyethylene and only a few inches thick. They are easily cut and most of their locations are recorded publicly. However, navy sources said the private companies operating them have laid so many that there is enough “redundancy” in the system to recover quickly from all but the most severe attacks. The ones that trouble the UK government most are used to transfer banking data across the Atlantic and are integral to the functioning of western financial markets. Satellite back-ups would not be able to handle the huge volume of information that flows through them every second of every day. The government started to worry about these vulnerabilities a decade ago, when George Osborne’s Treasury received a research paper from a young financier called Rishi Sunak, who had recently joined the Policy Exchange think tank. Secretive work was commissioned on how these cables could be better protected, but the answers were deemed to be in the “too-difficult category”, according to sources. Sunak’s paper would not be published until 2017, several years later. What troubles the military more profoundly is the ability of Russia to map, tap into or destroy military cables vital to its operations around the world. “There are cables that are not public,” said one senior source. “The Russians have the capability to cut military cables.” Before the visit to the Proteus, two senior UK sources told The Sunday Times that in around 2020, Russian UUVs — remotely operated and capable of operating at deep depths and travelling for hundreds of miles for days at a time — were found next to sensitive underwater cables. There was no mothership or submarine near by, suggesting they had travelled a great distance to reach the cables. The Ministry of Defence deemed it “beyond reasonable doubt” that the UUVs were attempting to hack the cables, although no evidence to date suggests Russia has succeeded. However, it has uncovered proof of other Russian activity that is altogether more disturbing. In recent years, the navy has found a number of sensor devices in the seas around Britain. The Ministry of Defence believes they were planted there by Moscow in order to detect the movements of Britain’s four Vanguard submarines, which together make up the UK’s constant at-sea nuclear deterrent. After leaving Faslane in Scotland, the submarines “vanish” and are supposed to be invisible from enemy states for the entirety of their deployment, which is typically 90 days or more. It is not clear what type of sensors were found. Several had washed up on the shore, but more have been identified using the Royal Navy’s fleet of mine-hunter vessels. As they searched, the navy found other sensors it did not know were there, The Ministry of Defence said the at-sea deterrent remains “undetected.” Whether the UK has discovered evidence of other Russian activity is top secret. “It’s a bit like the space race,” said one senior UK source. “This is a world clouded in secrecy and subterfuge, it’s very hard to get absolute clarity. But there’s enough smoke to suggest something is on fire somewhere.” In 2021, the Integrated Review — a master document outlining the UK’s national security and foreign policy aims after Brexit — committed to purchasing a surveillance ship to protect the UK’s critical underwater infrastructure and to allow the authorities to better understand the scale of the threat. Two years later, the MoD bought a Norwegian deep-water offshore support vessel, the Topaz Tangaroa, for £70 million. It was modified and renamed the Proteus before becoming operational in October 2023. The ship has a permanent crew of about 30 civilian sailors from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the merchant arm of the navy, but is ultimately run by specialist naval teams. Life on the Proteus is demanding and the ship is expected to be at sea 330 days a year. A week before The Sunday Times visit, members of the navy’s mine-hunting and threat-exploitation teams had embedded for the first time. Among them was X-Ray Squadron, which uses autonomous underwater vehicles for mine-hunting, as well as identifying and destroying threats. During our visit, the teams were training with one of their newest assets: the SeaCat, a cutting-edge 3m-long, torpedo-shaped autonomous vehicle. It has a high-resolution camera on its nose and advanced sonar systems on its sides like wings. It is capable of running for 24 hours at depths of 300m and one of the commanding officers says it is typically between “three and six times quicker” at hunting mines than conventional methods. Nearby, another team is preparing the Gavia, a UUV that can plunge 1,000m, deep enough to cover most of the waters surrounding the UK. Then there is the Defender, which can be fitted with an array of equipment, including manipulator arms. Porton Down, the military’s top-secret research facility, has been developing arms capable of handling and planting shaped charges, a precision explosive that can be used to disable enemy mines. This capability was tested recently off the coast of Norway, where the Proteus was sent to coincide with a visit by John Healey, the defence secretary, who is negotiating a deal with Oslo to work more closely together to counter the Russian threat. All three vehicles also have sophisticated sonar systems to scan large areas of sea bed. If they find suspicious activity, they can be sent closer to capture high-resolution images. Captain Simon Pressdee, one of the senior officers on the visit, said: “Our role is to both defeat any threats to the UK as well as take it out of the greyzone. We do the latter by understanding who is involved and providing that evidence to avoid misunderstandings and make those who threaten the UK accountable for their actions.” The Proteus has other assets that are able to delve to the deepest part of the ocean, although these were hidden away on the visit. With the government committed to spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence by 2027, further investment in sea-bed warfare is coming. The strategic defence review, commissioned by Healey to plug the gaps in Britain’s armed forces, is expected to recommend sharper focus on underwater infrastructure. Ministers have already accelerated the roll-out of the navy’s first autonomous mine-hunting vessel, the Ariadne and are rolling out a cutting-edge unmanned submarine under a programme called Project Cetus. The purchase of another Proteus-style ship is also being discussed. “Our adversary has multiple points of action that they can be playing, and we’ve only got one ship that can deal with it,” one insider said. As part of the review, the navy has proposed a new programme, Atlantic Bastion, which will develop a new fleet of air, surface and submersible vehicles, as well as sensors, to police British waters and the wider north Atlantic. In the shorter term, a project codenamed Cabot will get these capabilities up and running in partnership with private industries that rely on underwater infrastructure. This is likely to mean companies are asked to help fund operations, sources said. A similar idea has been pushed for years by Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the former Tory transport secretary and defence minister. “If this is a national endeavour, it is perhaps time to consider legislating for a level of assured protections of our energy, water, subsea cables … by asking everyone to chip in to the costs,” she said. “A hypothecated tax paid into a defence fund, which can provide protections and deterrence from those who wish our economic security and way of life harm, must be the way.” An MoD spokesman said: “We are committed to enhancing the security of critical offshore infrastructure. Alongside our NATO and Joint Expeditionary Force allies, we are strengthening our response to ensure that Russian ships and aircraft cannot operate in secrecy near the UK or near NATO territory, harnessing new technologies like AI and coordinating patrols with our allies. And our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent continues to patrol the world’s oceans undetected as it has done for 56 years.” Privately, some in the navy think the UK needs to go further and restore its capability to lay sea mines, something it has not done since the end of the Cold War. The last stockpiles were dispensed with in 1992, due to the ethical concerns of successive governments and the belief they were redundant. However, Australia has recently pledged £500 million for sea mines, and the Russian threat has reopened the question in the minds of some personnel. Poland and the Baltic states recently announced plans to withdraw from a treaty banning anti-personnel mines. The navy is not considering this at present and no proposal has been put forward as part of the strategic defence review. But one official, speaking anonymously, said the UK may well need to be able to lay defensive fields around British waters to keep out enemy submarines. Sir Keir Starmer’s government has clearly realised the scale of the threat, with billions of pounds of extra defence spending putting Britain closer to a war footing.

https://www.dw.com/en/gabons-junta-chief-expected-to-win-election-as-polls-open/a-72226389,"Polling centers closed in Gabon on Saturday after a presidential election which junta chief Brice Oligui Nguema is widely expected to win. Oligui Nguema, who led a coup in August 2023 and a month later declared himself transitional president, had been leading in pre-election polls. He campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket. He has also emphasized the need to break from the dynasty of Omar Bongo Ondimba and his son and successor Ali Bongo, who together ruled Gabon for more than 50 years. In the run up to the election — the first to be held in the country since the coup — Oligui Nguema had predicted a ""historic victory."" ""I am very confident. May the best man win,"" he said as he cast his ballot alongside his wife Zita at a school in the center of the Gabonese capital Libreville. His main opponent, Alain Claude ""Bilie"" By Nze, who was prime minister before the coup, has cast himself as the candidate for a ""complete rupture"" with the country's past. He has accused Oligui Nguema, who led the Republican Guard under the Bongos, of continuing their legacy. After casting his ballot, Nze warned reporters of potential ""problems"" during the counting.  ""We'll see what it will bring,"" he added. Election monitors at the Citizens Observers Network (ROC) said they were denied access to several voting offices, but Oligui Nguema insisted the election had been ""transparent"" and ""peaceful."" Ballot counting started shortly after 6 pm (5 pm UTC) when most polling centers closed, although some remained open for voters who were still waiting to cast their ballot.  Around 920,000 Gabonese were eligible to vote. The interior ministry said turnout was 87.12%. Initial results are expected to be announced on Sunday. The winner will be handed a seven-year mandate that can be renewed once. It is the Sahel nation's first election since the 2023 coup ousted the Bongo dynasty from power.  The election in the former French colony of 2.3 million people comes amid high unemployment, regular power and water shortages and heavy government debt. The small West African country is resource-rich, with significant deposits of petroleum, manganese, and iron ore.

http://ft.com/content/44b5046f-f916-4c13-af06-805c9373d5e8,"A recent plunge in oil prices, prompted by Donald Trump’s trade war, has started to deplete Vladimir Putin’s war chest. Moscow’s budget — about a third of which comes from oil and gas — may be as much as 2.5 per cent lower than expected in 2025 if crude prices stay at current levels. That would force the Kremlin to increase borrowing, cut nonmilitary spending or draw down its remaining reserves. The average price of Urals crude, Russia’s main export grade, has fallen to the lowest in almost two years, after the US president’s tariff announcements and an unexpected move by the Opec+ coalition to boost output. Urals was trading at about $50 a barrel as of Thursday, according to price reporting agency Argus. Russia planned its budget for 2025 based on Urals at $69.70 a barrel. The price drop adds to pressure on the Russian economy, which is expected to slow this year after being fuelled by war-related spending. Moscow already has used some of its sovereign wealth fund to support the economy after the fallout from Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the accessible portion of those funds is dwindling. In a rare acknowledgment of economic uncertainty, Russian officials have voiced concerns over the drop in oil prices.""		.		.		The situation is extremely volatile, tense and emotionally charged,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this week. The shift also shows how Trump’s tariff war is indirectly hurting the Russian economy despite the US president’s recent overtures to Moscow and promise to rekindle economic ties as part of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Oil is still down this week, despite Wednesday’s announcement of a 90-day pause to the sweeping tariff programme. Russia’s central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina warned on Tuesday, on the eve of Trump’s 90-day pause announcement, that “if trade wars continue, they usually lead to a global economic slowdown and possibly lower demand for our energy exports”.If oil prices hold near current levels, Russia could lose about a trillion roubles this year, the equivalent to 2.5 per cent of its expected budget revenues, according to chief economist at Moscow-based T-Investments Sofya Donets.	That would mean GDP growth falling by 0.5 percentage points, she said. Still, it would take several months for lower oil prices to feed through into budget revenues, according to Janis Kluge, a Russia expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. Russia’s economy is already running at full capacity, with growth — fuelled largely by war-related government spending — expected to slow. Official forecasts suggest an expansion of 1-2.5 per cent in 2025, down from about 4 per cent over the past two years. That makes it unlikely that the state can offset falling oil revenues with funds from non-energy sources. As Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has dragged into its fourth year, the government’s ability to cushion the economy has been diminishing. Since 2020, the liquid portion of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund — known as the national welfare fund — has fallen by two-thirds. If it is used to cover a widening budget deficit, it might not last far beyond the end of the year, according to Benjamin Hilgenstock, head of macroeconomic research and strategy at the Kyiv School of Economics Institute. “Whether the regime can do anything about this aside from painful cuts to non-war expenditures is a different matter,”	Hilgenstock said.About $340bn of the central bank’s reserves also remain frozen under western sanctions, sharply limiting the room for manoeuvre. With the welfare fund running lower, Moscow may be forced to cut spending, which would be a shift from its wartime increases. Economists warn any cuts will probably fall on nonmilitary budget areas, such as social spending.If the oil price stabilises at a very low level, Russia will probably have to tax export companies more to offset some of the revenue decline, according to Oleg Kuzmin, chief economist at Renaissance Capital. “After taxation adjustment and debt financing, Russia will have to consider spending cuts — which also remains an option but beyond ‘plan A’’ or ‘’plan B’,” he added. Moscow could also try to raise more debt on international markets, as its public debt burden currently stands below 30 per cent of GDP, a low level by international standards. But for many foreign investors Russian bonds remain toxic. At home, banks were focused on lending to the private sector and had shown little interest in financing deficits, said Hilgenstock, who expected serious constraints for the Russian economy but not a sudden collapse. “It is all not great for the budget, but not catastrophic,” he said.",Vladimir Putin’s war chest under threat as oil prices slide,Anastasia Stognei,Financial Times,2025-04-12T00:00:15,2025-04-12T00:00:16,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/12/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1143,"Here is where things stand on Saturday, April 12:
Fighting
Russia’s defence ministry said air defence units destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones within a span of 30 minutes late on Friday. The ministry said that between 10-10:30pm local time (19:00-19:30 GMT), nine drones were destroyed over Russia’s Rostov region on Ukraine’s eastern border, and four in the Kursk region on Ukraine’s northern border.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the site of a deadly Russian attack on his hometown of Kryvyi Rih, one week after a Russian missile strike killed 19 people, including nine children and teenagers.
Ukrainian officials have in recent days sent Washington a list of targets it believes Russia has struck in violation of the energy infrastructure ceasefire that Kyiv and Moscow agreed to last month as part of efforts by the United States to reach a ceasefire.
Military analysts believe Russia is preparing to launch a new military offensive in the coming weeks to ramp up pressure and strengthen the Kremlin’s hand in ceasefire negotiations.
President Zelenskyy said that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting at the Ukraine front line alongside Russian forces, and accused Moscow of dragging Beijing into its invasion of his country. “As of now, we have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia’s occupation forces,” Zelenskyy said.
More than 100 Chinese citizens fighting for the Russian military against Ukraine are mercenaries who do not appear to have a direct link to China’s government, two US officials familiar with American intelligence and a former Western intelligence official told the Reuters news agency. Chinese military officers have, however, been in the theatre of war behind Russia’s lines with Beijing’s approval to draw tactical lessons from the war, officials told Reuters.
Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was ready to purchase additional air defence systems, adding that he discussed it with US President Donald Trump.
Ceasefire
Talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Russia lasted more than four hours, with no concrete results disclosed. According to Russia’s Interfax news agency, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not rule out the possibility of another phone call between Putin and Trump following the discussions.
Trump said in a post earlier on Truth Social: “Russia has to get moving. Too many people [are] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!”
Russia has rejected a US-backed proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire and appears to be dragging its feet on a more limited truce in the Black Sea agreed last month, analysts said.
German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Friday, after presiding over a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group in Brussels alongside British Defence Secretary John Healey, that “ongoing aggression” from Russia meant “we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future”.
If a ceasefire is not achieved by the end of this month, Trump could impose additional sanctions on Russia, the US news site Axios reported, citing an anonymous source.
Ukraine could be partitioned like Berlin after World War II, President Trump’s envoy to Kyiv, General Keith Kellogg, appeared to suggest as Russia continues to hold out on accepting a truce. In an interview with The Times newspaper, Kellogg said the country could be split into zones of control, with British and French troops as part of a “reassurance force” in the west and Moscow’s forces in the east. Between them would be Ukrainian forces and a demilitarised zone.
Military Aid
European countries have promised to send billions of dollars in further funding to help Ukraine keep fighting Russia’s invasion. Ukraine’s allies pledged a record 21 billion euros ($23.9bn) of military aid for the country, with the United Kingdom Defence Secretary Healey warning that 2025 was “the critical year” for the war.
Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said that his country is monitoring the world armaments market and sees opportunities for Ukraine’s backers to buy more weapons and ammunition.
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was absent from the Ukraine donor’s forum that the US established and led for several years, although he spoke to the meeting via video.
Sanctions
A former Russian government minister who violated UK sanctions by receiving financial support from family members was sentenced to more than three years in prison in England. Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, who was appointed governor of Sevastopol in Russian-annexed Crimea by Putin, became the first person convicted of violating the sanctions put in place after the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
Estonia’s navy said it detained an oil tanker believed to belong to Russia’s “shadow fleet” in the Gulf of Finland in order to check its papers.
Regional security
A reduction in the number of US soldiers in Eastern Europe would be seen as Washington moving another step closer to Moscow and a worrying sign for Europeans, according to analysts. The NBC news channel, quoting US and European sources, said this week that the US Department of Defense was looking at the withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Europe.
President Putin announced billions in investments for the rearmament of his country’s navy. “In the next decade, 8.4 trillion roubles [around $97bn] are earmarked for the construction of new boats and ships for the navy,” Putin said at a meeting on navy development in Saint Petersburg, according to Russian news agencies.
Putin said the navy would develop drone and robot technology, and he claimed that 49 warships of various classes have been built in Russian shipyards in the past five years, including nuclear submarines that can be equipped with new Zircon hypersonic missiles.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sharply criticised European Union politicians against the backdrop of a rapprochement between the Kremlin and the new US administration.
Politicians such as acting German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, European Union top diplomat Kaja Kallas and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were not thinking of their voters, but had put the desire to punish Russia above the wellbeing of their own citizens, Lavrov said.","Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,143",Al Jazeera,Al Jazeera,2025-04-12T01:04:36,2025-04-12T01:04:37,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.ft.com/content/fba18bd9-46f9-4736-89f3-976afe3abf7a,"The EU is prepared to deploy its most powerful trade measures and may impose levies on US digital companies if negotiations with Donald Trump fail to end his tariff war against Europe. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told the Financial Times that the EU would seek a “completely balanced” agreement with Washington during Trump’s 90-day pause in applying additional tariffs. But the Commission president warned she was ready to dramatically expand the transatlantic trade war to services if those talks failed, potentially including a tax on digital advertising revenues that would hit tech groups such as Amazon, Google and Facebook. “We are developing retaliatory measures,” von der Leyen said, explaining these could include the first use of the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument with the power to hit services exports. “There’s a wide range of countermeasures	.	.	.	.in case the negotiations are not satisfactory.” She said this could include tariffs on the services trade between the US and the EU, stressing the exact measures would depend on the outcome of talks with Washington. “An example is you could put a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services.” The measure would be a tariff applied across the single market. This differs from digital sales taxes, which are imposed individually by member states. Von der Leyen, head of the EU’s executive, said Trump’s trade war had caused “a complete inflection point in global trade”. “It’s a turning point with the United States without any question,” she said, adding: “We will never go back any more to the status quo.” “There are no winners in this, only losers,” she continued, referring to turmoil in stock and bond markets. “Today we see the cost of chaos	.	.	.	.the costs of the uncertainty that we are experiencing today will be heavy.” Citing the need to negotiate with Washington, the Commission on Thursday paused its planned retaliation against US steel and aluminium tariffs, which were imposed last month. The measures would have hit around €21bn of US imports, including poultry, orange juice and yachts. Von der Leyen, who oversees trade policy on behalf of the EU’s 27 member states, said the Commission had previously attempted to negotiate with the US but was told to wait until Trump’s April 2 announcement, which imposed a 20 per cent “reciprocal” tariff on the EU. She has publicly offered a zero-for-zero tariff deal on industrial goods but has had little traction in Washington, where officials complain about alleged EU non-tariff trade barriers such as VAT and product standards. Von der Leyen said she was open to discussing aligning EU and US standards but said it was likely to produce limited results. “I think it’s absolutely worth looking at where we can align our norms and standards to make business easier. So I’m open to that,” she said. “But we should not raise expectations too much because	.	.	.	.often there are different standards because there are differences in the way of life and in the culture.” She ruled out revisiting the EU’s “untouchable” regulations on digital content and market power, which Trump officials see as an effective tax on US Big Tech firms. Nor will the EU negotiate over VAT, which she said was equivalent to US sales tax: “These are not in the packages of negotiation because these are our sovereign decisions.” If negotiations fail, the EU would automatically reactivate the retaliatory measures planned in response to US tariffs on steel and aluminium. In addition, von der Leyen said further countermeasures to Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs could target the US’s huge services surplus with the EU. The US president only counts goods in his trade figures, excluding US services exported to the rest of the world. “Companies that offer services make a good business in this [EU] market. And the vast majority of the services, 80 per cent of the services are coming from the US. So again, we want a negotiated solution that is the best for us, all of us,” she said. As well as potentially targeting services trade, von der Leyen said Brussels was also considering moves such as a possible levy on scrap metal exports to the US, where EU supplies are in high demand from US steel mills. Turning to the potential knock-on effect of a global trade war, von der Leyen said the EU “will not tolerate” Chinese goods hit by US tariffs being redirected to Europe, adding that Brussels would “take safeguards” if a new monitoring mechanism detected an increase in Chinese imports. Von der Leyen said she had made this point to Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang in a call this week, and that he had replied that “this risk does not exist because they would stimulate the consumption in China”. Regardless of the outcome of negotiations with the US, Trump’s policies had radically reshaped global trade relations, von der Leyen said, and spurred talks between the EU and powers including Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. “[There is] the interest of so many countries around the world to work closer with us, together, to balance the system and to have free trade really competing on quality and not around tariffs,” von der Leyen said. Both the US and EU agree that the World Trade Organization rules have failed to ensure a level playing field as China subsidises some of its manufacturing output, flooding global markets. The trade war has now spurred discussions on “thinking how we can modernise, reform and stabilise the WTO”. “But the emphasis must be on modernising and reform, it cannot be preserving what we have today because there are too many difficulties,” she said. “I mean, never waste a good crisis.”","EU could tax Big Tech if Trump trade talks fail, says von der Leyen   ","Henry Foy,Roula Khalaf,Andy Bounds",Financial Times,2025-04-10T16:00:39,2025-04-11T10:55:29,gemini-2.0-flash

The plan suggests a second successive EU-China summit would be held in the Chinese capital, despite the fact that the location is supposed to rotate.

https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-responding-helicopter-hudson-river/16153664/,"JERSEY CITY, New Jersey (WABC) --Six people were killed after a tourist helicopter carrying a family from Spain crashed into New York City's Hudson River on Thursday afternoon. The crash was reported at 3:17 p.m. on the Jersey City side of the Hudson. Agustin Escobar, a Siemens executive from Barcelona, Spain, his wife Merce Camprubi Montal, and their children, ages 4, 5, and 11, were killed in the crash, law enforcement sources told ABC News. The pilot, who was 36, was also killed, making a total six people. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the helicopter was operated by New York Helicopters. The FAA believes the helicopter is a Bell 206 and appears to have taken off from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport at 2:59 p.m. It went up to the George Washington Bridge before turning back south along the Jersey side of the river. It went off radar at 3:25 p.m. Video shared with Eyewitness News appeared to show pieces of the helicopter break apart and crash into the water. Officials say the helicopter hit the water inverted, without a tail rotor or a main rotor blade. For witnesses, it turned out to be a memory full of horror. ""I watched it fall out of the sky! I heard five or six loud noises that sounded almost like gunshots in the sky and saw pieces fall off, then watched it fall into the river,"" said Dani Horbiak, who saw the crash from her apartment window. ""It sounded like a sonic boom on my right and so I look up and literally I see a helicopter splitting in two with the rotor flying off and this guy was going straight into the water and nothing came up afterwards,"" said a witness named Max. Officials say the entire flight lasted all of 15 minutes, before witnesses say it took an upside-down nosedive. ""It just kind of fell apart and it was the most terrifying thing that we ever witnessed,"" Rajany said. ""I heard some crackling, looked up and then just saw a plane falling apart,"" said witness Bruce Wall. ""And then maybe 15 feet in the air after the tail came off, broke off, and then the plane just sort of tumbled into the water with the propeller still in the air."" FDNY and NYPD divers were in the water almost immediately and assisted in the recovery. Four of the victims were declared dead at the scene and two victims were sent to local hospitals where they were pronounced dead. Jersey City Medical Center, where the passengers were transported after the crash, tried as hard as they could, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said. ""Our hearts go out to the family and those on board,"" Mayor Eric Adams said. A crane vessel hoisted the crumpled wreckage of the helicopter out of the Hudson and onto a barge Thursday night. Fulop said the main body of the aircraft has been recovered and is in the Army Corps of Engineers facility on Chapel Avenue, however major parts of the aircraft have still not been recovered. He says dive operations by the NYPD and NJSP will resume Friday morning. Police fished out chunks of jagged metal that washed up to the Jersey City shore, along with a life preserver, a seat and the personal effects of a family of five. The Spanish Consulate of New York City is now in touch with authorities to gather and confirm information and identification of the people involved in the helicopter crash, according to the communications team at the Spanish Foreign Ministry. The Jersey City Police Department is taking the lead on the investigation since the helicopter crashed on the Jersey City side of the river, Fulop said. Fulop said tours in the area are constant and fall within a busy and heavily trafficked area. He hopes this will increase the dialogue to decrease traffic. ""Hopefully this brings some more attention to it, that the fact beyond just noise, you have real safety concerns,"" Fulop said. The FAA says they are temporarily halting all operations around the Hudson River crash site. The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate the crash, and is expected to arrive on Thursday night. They will have to piece together what went wrong, and what caused the rotors to break apart, dooming the 21-year-old helicopter and the six people aboard. At least 32 people have died in helicopter crashes in NYC since 1977 -- most recently in 2019 when a helicopter used for executive travel hit the roof of Manhattan skyscraper in restricted airspace and the pilot was killed. ---------- *Get Eyewitness News Delivered *Follow us on YouTube *More local news *Send us a news tip *Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/04/05/japan/politics/japan-nato-rutte-interview/,"Japan and NATO plan to take their partnership to the next level by stepping up information-sharing and defense-industrial cooperation, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told The Japan Times, as the 32-member military alliance views “more practical"" cooperation with Tokyo and other Indo-Pacific partners as key to addressing global security challenges. “We need to have more flesh on the bones,” Rutte said in an exclusive interview Friday, pointing out that the alliance aims to expand ties not only with Japan but also Australia, New Zealand and South Korea — commonly known as the Indo-Pacific four (IP4) — to enable greater collaboration in areas such as industrial production, innovation and data exchanges on matters of mutual concern. “We have to move beyond ... joint declarations ... let’s make it practical,” the NATO chief said ahead of a planned trip to Japan next Tuesday and Wednesday. The trip will be Rutte’s first to the region since taking office in October, as he seeks to implement lessons from the ongoing war in Ukraine. Rutte’s remarks came after a two-day NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels that saw several alliance members announce new military aid packages for Ukraine and pledge increased defense spending. Top diplomats from the IP4 countries, including Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, were also invited to the event. Rutte’s Japan trip will include meetings with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, members of parliament as well as the defense, foreign and trade ministers. One of the key aims of these meetings is to gain a better understanding of the situation in the Indo-Pacific, particularly the security challenges faced by Japan, according to the NATO chief. Rutte is also expected to visit Yokosuka Naval Base and Mitsubishi Electric Kamakura Works in Kanagawa Prefecture, both of which highlight the significance the Western military alliance is placing on boosting industrial cooperation. At the same time, the move will allow the NATO chief to deepen his understanding of the Self-Defense Forces’ capabilities. “I will be visiting the defense-industrial base in Japan, speaking with industry leaders to understand their assessment of the situation, what they do to ramp up production and how we can better work together,” Rutte said. “We are struggling with red tape all over NATO territory. I want to learn how Japan is now fighting this issue, because I know that some of these problems are similar and we can learn from each other,” he noted. The aim, he added, is to find ways to make defense companies become “even more interlinked.” While South Korea is already an important defense equipment provider to several NATO member states, the alliance is looking for greater tie-ups with the remaining IP4 countries in areas where they can complement each other. “We are really trying to build on this shared defense-industrial base. We know that many allies are already buying ... largely into the (South) Korean defense industry,” Rutte told reporters earlier Friday. “So we have that connection, and I think that is very valid.” Speaking on condition of anonymity, a NATO official said part of the goal is to explore ways to ramp up defense production, adding that discussions with the IP4 will revolve around “the kind of standards we set and how our industries develop products that can be used both by partners and allies.” “We need to do more ... and I think the point here is to make sure that the defense industries can work together better, and identify the areas where we can do more together,” the official added. NATO’s drive for more practical cooperation comes at a time when Japan has been easing restrictions on its defense export guidelines in a bid to strengthen its defense-industrial base. Some experts believe cooperation could potentially go beyond the established defense firms, suggesting that NATO and IP4 countries could eventually also consider joint production of dual-use goods while facilitating collaboration between defense startups. The secretary-general said that developments in the Ukraine war, particularly what he described as China, North Korea and Iran’s “continued support for Russia’s war machine,” have convinced NATO members that the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions is “more connected than ever” — a view also shared by Tokyo. This, he explained, is why they are all in agreement about the need to accelerate engagement with the IP4. One important driver appears to be the alliance’s growing concern about China’s military capabilities, its lack of transparency about military modernization goals, its regional assertiveness and Beijing's increasingly close ties with Moscow. “The buildup of their armed forces and investments in their defense industry and capabilities is staggering,” Rutte said. On Beijing’s military moves, the NATO chief didn't mince words, even going as far as to say that, personally, one “could increasingly see China as a threat.” “When you look at the buildup of the defense industrial base in China, when you look at the fact that they have now more navy ships sailing than the U.S., that they will go into 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, it's absolutely clear that we cannot be naive about China,” Rutte said. “That's the reason why we work so intensely together (with the IP4),” he added. “What’s important now is that we deepen that cooperation.” Earlier this week, Iwaya held separate talks with the NATO chief where he expressed Tokyo’s intention to take ties with the alliance to an “even higher level” so as to jointly address security challenges that transcend the region, such as Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Iwaya also represented Japan at NATO’s meeting with IP4 countries, calling the bilateral partnership “stronger than ever.” “We place importance on institutionalizing this relationship,” Iwaya said, pointing to Tokyo’s appointment of a new full-time ambassador to the alliance in January as well as efforts to establish a system to share classified information with the alliance. This year’s NATO foreign ministers’ summit came almost two years after Japan and NATO upgraded ties to a so-called Individually Tailored Partnership Program (ITPP) — a move that saw bilateral collaboration go beyond traditional security fields and extend to areas such as cyber, emerging and disruptive technologies and countering disinformation. The ITPP also outlined three strategic objectives for the 2023 to 2026 period, including strengthening dialogue and consultations, enhancing resilience and boosting interoperability.",‘Let’s make it practical’: NATO chief eyes greater defense-industrial ties with Japan,Gabriel Dominguez,The Japan Times,2025-04-05,2025-04-05,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/eu-goes-hunting-for-central-asias-mineral-riches-at-samarkand-summit/,"SAMARKAND, UZBEKISTAN – With access to rare metals and critical minerals on their minds, a number of top EU leaders are travelling to Samarkand to meet with Central Asian presidents in a glittering palace on the outskirts of this ancient crossroads city. Central Asian leaders invited the European Union with a mix of enthusiasm and caution to gather on Thursday and Friday in Samarkand, situated along the historic Silk Road trade routes which now serves as Uzbekistan's host city for major diplomatic meetings The aim is to “significantly strengthen ties”, said the EU's ambassador to Uzbekistan, Toivo Klaar. Among the few announcements expected at the summit itself is the the creation of a European Investment Bank office in Tashkent, and plans for a European investment forum to be held in Uzbekistan before the end of the year. A “Samarkand declaration” that will reflect “the common aspiration of the parties to establish a strategic partnership” is also expected at the summit. Talks will touch on issues including connectivity, the environment and security as this year's EU focus considerably shifts to critical minerals. In this part of Eurasia, which has long been seen as a backwater by many in the EU, has seen a renewed interest from the West since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which upended long-standing economic relations and led Europeans to reconsider their geopolitical position. The landlocked former Soviet republics in Central Asia – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – are strategically significant, with governments still close with Moscow and much courted by Beijing. Russian firms have used the region as a base for efforts to circumvent Western economic sanctions. Europeans are seeking to strengthen their influence with Central Asian governments for this reason. But efforts to secure supplies of important minerals, and Europe's urgent need to diversify energy supplies, are also key motivations. In addition to large uranium reserves, Central Asian countries have vast deposits of rare earths and new minerals such as lithium, as well as a host of other resources that are essential for the energy transition and new technologies. This is what Brussels is actively seeking, as the EU currently depends almost entirely on China for supplies of those resources. In March, the European Commission unveiled a plan to revive mining, including projects in third countries, less than a year after EU legislation aimed at securing the supply of critical raw materials came into force. ""We see the EU is very interested in Central Asia,"" said Han Ilhan, a consultant and board advisor to the Uzbekistan Technological Metals Complex. ""Many projects are being discussed right now.” Central Asia could become something like the El Dorado of European dreams. The 34 critical raw materials identified as needed by the EU – including cobalt, copper, tungsten, lithium and nickel – are present in large quantities in the Central Asian subsoil. “It's a little-known region, yet all the Central Asian countries are among the top 10 richest in terms of ores and rare earths, varying by type of material, with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan ahead of the pack,” said Roman Vakulchuk, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. “The investment climate is not very favourable, so we are not yet seeing a rush of Western rare metals western mining companies into Central Asia. But it won't be long,” said a French diplomat in Kazakhstan. The diplomat pointed in part to the absence of international standards in the mining sector in Central Asian countries. That hasn't stopped some European firms from plunging into the region. Germany's HMS Bergbau AG is implementing a joint project to exploit lithium deposits in eastern Kazakhstan. In November, Astana and Paris signed a roadmap for a strategic partnership in the field of critical resources and materials that runs through 2026. The deal should enable French companies to penetrate the Kazakh geological market as early as this year. At the EU level, Commissioner for External Partnerships Joseph Síkela signed a €3 million partnership agreement with Kazakhstan on critical raw materials and rare earths on March 13. Last May, Uzbekistan signed a memorandum of understanding with the EU for the same sector. The EU may have arrived late to Central Asia. China has been interested in its neighbours' underground resources for over a decade, and Chinese fims already hold most of the licenses and mining sites in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The majority of critical mineral exports from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are currently reserved for Beijing. Russia, for its part, has for decades largely secured its uranium needs from the region, which the Kremlin regards as its strategic ""near abroad"". The region is also economically dependent on Moscow for many infrastructure projects. On the other hand, the rush for critical metals in Central Asia has not gone unnoticed by other newcomers such as the United States, Canada and South Korea, all of which have recently signed major deals with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. ""Despite its fine words, the European Union is only involved in two or three projects in Central Asia. That's very little and very slow, even though it has been interacting with these governments for decades,"" Vakulchuk said, pointing out that rare metals are not mentioned in the EU's 'Global Gateway' strategy until 2023. But the region is still heavily dependent on Russia and China, which remains a sensitive issue. “We see from Central Asia a wish to deepen relationships with the EU and diversify their foreign policy,” one top EU official said. As the Samarkand summit approaches, European interest seems to have been appreciated – but has been greeted with caution, with no statement from Central Asian republics suggesting that the EU will play a greater role in the region.

https://www.rfa.org/english/tibet/2025/04/01/tibet-military-on-campus-instructors/,"China is placing army veterans as so-called “on-campus instructors” in schools across Tibet to impart military and political training to Tibetan children as young as 6, sources inside Tibet say, confirming state-run media reports about the new system. The move is a bid to instill loyalty to the Chinese government from a young age -– an initiative that experts say highlight an escalation in Beijing’s assimilation policies aimed at erasing Tibetan identity. State-run TV segments show Tibetan students marching in fatigues, raising the red Chinese flag and standing in formation while responding to commands from the instructors. Other footage shows children diving under their desks for air raid drills and evacuating down stairs with notebooks held over their heads for protection against falling objects. Military personnel are being deployed to schools in Lhasa, Chamdo, and Nagchu in the Tibet Autonomous Region, or TAR, Ngaba and Kyungchu counties in Sichuan province, Sangchu county in Gansu province as well as other regions in Qinghai province, the sources told RFA Tibetan. There, they are tasked with providing ""patriotic education"" and preparing Tibetan children for future military service, the sources said. Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force over 70 years ago. Ever since, Chinese authorities have maintained a tight grip on the region, restricting the Tibetan people’s peaceful expression of cultural and religious identity and use of the Tibetan language. “It’s no longer just about China swapping out Tibetan language in textbooks for Mandarin, the first source told Radio Free Asia, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.  “Now, they are sending military personnel and Chinese Communist Party cadres to schools across Tibet to provide ideological education to thoroughly change Tibetan children’s values, way of thinking, and overall mannerisms in order to build their loyalty to the party,” he said. In Nagchu, for example, 13 retired Han Chinese army veterans were installed as “on-campus instructors” at seven different schools, ranging from primary to middle school, to help instill “correct values” in children, local state-run media reported.  At least such two video reports showed that during such training periods, instructors blew whistles in the early mornings to wake up the children and instill army style culture in schools. TV footage also showed instructors dressed in fatigues inspecting bunk beds to see if the beds are made properly. The new system seeks to “let national defense education take root from childhood” and to ready Tibetan children for future military service, in what authorities said creates a “new win-win situation for veterans’ services and youth ideological and political education,” state-run media reports said.  “Usually, the Chinese Ministry of Education creates a list of primary and secondary national defense education demonstration schools,” Anushka Saxena, a research analyst at Bengaluru, India-based Takshashila Institution, told Radio Free Asia.  “Such schools are those where the PLA feels it needs to inculcate a sense of unity” with the Communist Party’s cause, she said, referring to the People’s Liberation Army. “Hence, schools in Tibet become an important target, given the need to assimilate and have younger generations feel a sense of loyalty to the country and the military,” she said. Experts said the proliferation of uniformed military personnel in various local Tibetan primary and middle schools is a direct result of the recently amended National Defense Education Law, which was passed by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, China’s top legislature, and came into effect in September 2024. Under the amendments, branches of the People’s Liberation Army will be stationed in colleges, universities and high schools across the country to boost a nationwide program of approved military education and physical training to prepare young people for recruitment, state news agency Xinhua reported at the time. “Together with other coercive means… this law is now being abused as an auxiliary tool to achieve the CCP’s – yet still elusive – goal of full Sinicization of Tibetans, by both militarizing and brainwashing the generation of young Tibetan who are coming of age in the current decade,” said Frank Lehberger, a Germany-based Sinologist and senior research fellow at Indian think tank Usanas Foundation, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. China has long had a culture of military training in schools and universities, with Tibetan school children aged 8-16 forced to attend military training programs during vacation and Tibetan university students made to participate in military drills and training exercises.  But the “on-campus instructor” system is a first, experts say. Chinese authorities chose Sernye district in Nagchu as the first pilot area in Tibet to implement the system, which they refer to as “...the innovative practice of integrating veterans’ management with school education.”  This, experts say, is in line with goals outlined in China’s government work report for 2025, in which Premier Li Qiang said the government will draw up and implement a three-year action plan to strengthen education by adopting “integrated reforms and new approaches” in the “political education curriculum at all levels, from elementary school to university.”  “These efforts at reshaping Tibetan children’s values and thought processes go beyond the classroom,” a second source from Tibet told RFA.  “These party cadres with extensive military experience enter students’ dormitories even after school hours to enforce Han Chinese ideologies and teach their social norms and conducts,” he said. “This is aimed at deconstructing Tibetan children’s existing thought patterns and cultural practices, which they have learned from their parents and traditions.” In Ngaba and Dzoge county in Sichuan province, for example, where Chinese authorities recently closed two monastic schools and forced young monks from these schools into state-administered boarding schools, sources say there is a greater emphasis on providing political education to Tibetan children.  The closure of the two schools in July 2024 affected about 1600 students who were then forced to enrol in state-run boarding schools.  “I’ve received essays written anonymously by Tibetan teachers from inside Tibet who have expressed their frustration at seeing the complete changes in school curriculum with heavy propaganda messages. This includes showing soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army in a heroic light,” said Tsewang Dorji, Research Fellow at the Tibet Policy Institute.  The “on-campus instructors” in Tibetan schools serve multiple roles, including as national defense education counselors, behavioral norms instructors, and ideological and political lecturers, local Chinese state media reported. Some of the training they provide and activities they lead in the schools, include Chinese flag-raising march, singing of military songs before meals, and provision of political and ideological education, with an emphasis on stories that glorify the ‘Chinese nation’ and service to it, reports said.  “The PLA finds relevance in cultivating soldiers from Tibet given Tibetan’s natural and habitual adjustment with climates of high altitude. When it comes to cultivating professionals capable of conducting mountain warfare against adversaries like India, Tibetans can be an important asset for the PLA,” Saxena said. Chinese state media also celebrated the success of the pilot project in Nagchu, saying more than 300 Tibetan students have applied to be “future military service volunteers.”  Translated by Tenzin Norzom.

https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/wildfires/wildfires-continue-rage-carolinas-rcna198328,"The Table Rock wildfire burning in South Carolina continued to grow Thursday, but conditions that created dramatic expansion the day before eased, officials said. 

The fire, which was started March 21 by hikers, had burned an estimated 8,679 acres by 4:30 p.m. Thursday when a flight captured infrared data, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said.

Hundreds of residents in North Carolina and South Carolina have been ordered to leave and structures have been destroyed in the fires, which are burning amid abnormally dry or drought conditions in both states.

Downed timber left in the wake of Hurricane Helene, a devastating storm that struck in September, has also been fueling the fires' spread, officials have said.

“The amount of downed debris and timber in the woods is almost indescribable,” Madeline Stewart, the South Carolina Forestry Commission Public Information Coordinator, said on NBC’s “TODAY” show.

North Carolina fires

In North Carolina, there are eight active wildfires in Caldwell, Buncombe, Polk, Jackson, Haywood and Swain counties, according to an interactive map by the North Carolina Forest Service.

New fires sparked in dry conditions Wednesday, prompting Gov. Josh Stein to declare another state of emergency “to make sure we have every tool at our disposal” to respond to fires in the western part of the state.

The worst blazes are the Black Cove Complex Fire and the Deep Woods Fire, both in Polk County and Henderson County.

The Black Cove Complex fire has burned around 3,288 acres and was 17% contained Thursday evening, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture said in an update. The fire first ignited March 19 by a downed power line.

""Fire behavior has continued to be intense, with rapid fire spread and extreme burning conditions due to high winds and dry weather,"" the department said.

But on the Deep Woods Fire, there was better news Thursday. There was progress on containment of that fire, which has burned an estimated 3,373 acres in size and was 30% contained by that evening, the department said. It was first reported March 19 and the cause is under investigation.

A third fire that had prompted evacuation orders, the Fish Hook Fire, was 199 acres in size and 95% contained. Evacuation orders had previously been lifted.

South Carolina fires

In South Carolina, the Table Rock Fire and the Persimmon Ridge Fire were the two major wildfires in the state. 

The Persimmon Ridge Fire ""saw only modest expansion"" Thursday as conditions were milder than what was seen Wednesday, state officials said.

The fire grew to 1,992 acres Thursday, but the state forestry department said most of that growth was from ""burnouts"" created by firefighters between existing fire breaks.

The Table Rock Fire was started by “the negligent act of some hikers,"" the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office said last week.

“The young men that are responsible for the fire have been identified. The investigation is continuing by agents and detectives with the sheriff’s office as well as those with the South Carolina Forestry Commission, and the appropriate charges will be discussed and made at a later date,” Sheriff Tommy Blankenship said in a March 21 statement.

On Wednesday, the South Carolina Forestry commission called for the immediate evacuations of residents in Greenville and Pickens counties.

“Never in my 52 years did I think would I be running from my home in a fire,” said Wendy Clarke, who evacuated her home in the Caesar's Head area near the Persimmon Ridge Fire to a local shelter.","Hurricane Helene aftermath fuels Carolina fires, prompting new warnings and evacuations","Marlene Lenthang, Phil Helsel",NBC News,2025-03-28T03:45:36,2025-03-28T03:45:36,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.kcra.com/article/yuba-county-police-shooting-olivehurst-kestrel-court/64297900,"A Marysville Police Department officer was killed in a shootout that also left a gunman dead Wednesday morning during an operation cracking down on transnational drug trafficking organizations, officials said. The officer was identified as Osmar Rodarte. He was 27. During a news conference, Yuba County District Attorney Clint Curry said multiple law enforcement agencies on Wednesday launched 20 search warrants across Yuba, Sutter, Tehama and Butte counties as a result of a years-long investigation into drug trafficking. Leer en espaÃ±ol One of those search warrants brought law enforcement officials across multiple agencies to a neighborhood along Kestrel Court in the Olivehurst area around 7:50 a.m. Yuba County Sheriff Wendell Anderson said a SWAT team entered a home, which led to an exchange of gunfire between law enforcement and a person inside the home. Both officer Rodarte and the gunman were hurt in the shootout. Anderson said first responders took Rodarte to the Adventist Health and Rideout hospital, where he later died of his injuries. He was a two-year veteran with the police department and a U.S. Army veteran. Find details on a procession for Rodarte on Thursday here. ""Obviously, this tragedy has rocked our small community,"" Anderson said. The sheriff said the gunman died at the scene, and there was another person inside the house who DA Curry said is being considered a witness at this time. | VIDEO BELOW | Full March 26 press conference on Marysville officer killed ""This morning we have learned that one of our young brave Marysville police officers has been killed in the line of duty,"" California Assemblymember James Gallagher said on X in confirming the death.

First responders from across the region converged at the Marysville hospital when the slain officer was taken. They held a procession just before 1 p.m. that passed underneath a large American flag that was hosted onto fire truck ladders near Highway 70. Rodarte was described as more than a colleague. He was ""a friend, a father, an army veteran and a true hero,"" Marysville police said in a statement. Marysville Mayor Chris Branscum said he learned about the shooting earlier in the morning and walked into a room of Marysville police officers, with one sergeant on a knee, saying a prayer for the slain officer. | VIDEO BELOW | A look at the shooting scene Curry said prior to Wednesday's operation, before law enforcement launched their search warrants, they seized hundreds of pounds of different drugs, including methamphetamine and fentanyl. âThese were major players moving poison through our communities,"" Curry said.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/wildfires-ravaging-southern-south-korea-leave-24-dead-force-thousands-to-evacuate,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Wind-driven
wildfires
that were among South Korea’s worst ever have ravaged the country’s southern regions, killing 24 people, destroying more than 300 structures and forcing 28,800 residents to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.

The death toll included a pilot who died after a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a blaze in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the hardest-hit areas. The aircraft had no other crew members. Police said that most of the dead are those in their 60s and 70s.

The National Fire Agency said at least 26 people sustained varying degrees of injuries.

An ancient Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 17,752 hectares (43,866 acres), the government’s emergency response center said.

In a televised address, South Korea’s acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were worse than many previous ones.

“Damages are snowballing,” Han said. “There are concerns that we’ll have wildfire damages that we’ve never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week.”

Han said crews struggled to extinguish the wildfires because strong winds swept the areas overnight. He also said about 4,650 firefighters, soldiers and other personnel were working Wednesday with the help of about 130 helicopters, adding that “a small amount” of 5-10 millimeters (0.1-0.3 inches) of rain was expected Thursday.

As of Wednesday evening, firefighters were tackling at least six active wildfires, including in the southeastern coastal town of Yeongdeok, which alerted residents of the nearest village to evacuate to an indoor gymnasium.

Strong winds and smoke-filled skies forced authorities in the southeastern city of Andong to order evacuations in two villages, including Puncheon, home to the Hahoe folk village — a UNESCO World Heritage Site founded around the 14th-15th century. Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri Mountain, one of the country’s largest national parks, as another fire spread closer.

Observers say the ongoing wildfires are the third biggest in South Korea’s history in terms of land burned. The largest fires were in Andong, the neighboring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan.

On Tuesday, officials said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again.

The blaze in Uiseong destroyed about 20 of the 30 buildings and structures at Gounsa, a temple said to be originally built in the 7th century. Among the burned structures were two state-designated “treasures” — a pavilion-shaped building erected overlooking a stream in 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.

Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry said it protectively removed 500 inmates from a detention center in Cheongsong, another southern town, but no damages were reported to the facility.

The Korea Forest Service said it had raised its wildfire warning to the highest level nationwide, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.

Among the dead were
four firefighters and government workers
who died in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds, according to officials.

Government officials suspect human error caused several of the fires, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.","Wildfires ravaging southern South Korea leave 24 dead, force thousands to evacuate","Kim Tong-Hyung, Associated Press, Hyung-Jin Kim, Associated Press",PBS News,2025-03-26T15:50:30,2025-03-26T15:50:30,gemini-2.0-flash

Zuhair Qarout emphasized at a news conference in Damascus the catastrophic effect of the medication shortage on thousands of patients and their families across Syria. He described the shortage as a true public health and humanitarian crisis affecting some of the most vulnerable and fragile groups in society. Qarout urged the UN, World Health Organization, UNICEF, EU humanitarian aid agencies, and friendly and brotherly countries, as well as international NGOs, to provide necessary pharmaceutical support so Syria can continue to treat cancer patients. He stressed the urgent need to ease international restrictions to remove barriers hindering the import of medications. Bashar Assad, Syria’s leader for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia after anti-regime groups took control of Damascus on Dec. 8, ending the Baath Party regime, which had been in power since 1963. Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led anti-regime forces to oust Assad, was declared president for a transitional period in late January.","Syria faces severe shortage of cancer medications, official urges international aid","Ahmet Karaahmet, Mahmut Nabi and Rania Abu Shamala",aa.com.tr,2025-03-26,2025-03-26,gemini-2.0-flash
https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-03-25/venezuela-calls-trumps-secondary-tariffs-illegal-and-desperate.html,"The Venezuelan government responded to the new U.S. crackdown on Monday with a message directed at Donald Trump. In a statement from the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry, it rejected the 25% secondary tariffs on Venezuelan oil and gas announced by the U.S. president, calling the measure “arbitrary, illegal, and desperate.” For the Venezuelan government, this move only confirms “the failure of all sanctions imposed against our country.” Throughout Trump’s two and a half years of confrontations with Venezuela and the broader international community, the government — led by President Nicolás Maduro — had maintained some room for negotiation in its public statements. Trump initially signaled a willingness to engage, sending Richard Grenell to meet with Nicolás Maduro at Miraflores in what appeared to be an attempt at rapprochement. However, relations quickly soured as Trump escalated pressure — revoking the license of U.S. oil giant Chevron (whose deadline to cease operations was extended on Monday until May 27), deporting Venezuelans to El Salvador, and now imposing secondary tariffs. Any nation that buys oil or gas from Venezuela will face a 25% tariff on “any trade they do with our country,” Trump said on Monday. In its statement, Venezuela directly addresses Trump, while also dedicating several paragraphs to accusing the Venezuelan opposition. “For years, the fascist right, repudiated by the Venezuelan people, has promoted economic sanctions in the hope of subjugating Venezuela,” the statement reads. The government argues that Trump’s actions violate international trade norms and vows to take legal action in multilateral organizations to defend itself. China is the primary buyer of Venezuelan crude oil and gas, followed by India’s Reliance Industries, with whom Venezuela has sought to strengthen trade ties. However, the newly imposed tariffs, along with the potential halt of Chevron’s operations, threaten Venezuela’s recent recovery in oil production, which had been nearing one million barrels per day after hitting historic lows four years ago. Other key partners include Spain, which continues operations through Repsol under compliance letters issued in the final phase of Joe Biden’s sanctions framework in 2024. Other buyers of Venezuelan oil include Cuba, Russia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Dominican Republic. These secondary tariffs on exports to the United States, which could also affect countries trading Venezuelan crude, echo the secondary sanctions Trump imposed in 2019 during his first administration. At the time, Russia’s Rosneft was penalized by Washington for conducting business with Venezuela. In response, Venezuela was forced to develop a costly underground system to sell its oil at steep discounts, using opaque barter agreements and transshipment via shadow ships. “Imperial announcements only motivate us to work harder,” Maduro declared on Monday in response to the White House’s decision. The full impact of these tariffs, set to take effect on April 2 — a date Trump has called “Liberation Day” in his announcement on Truth Social — remains to be seen, particularly in how they will affect the remaining trade relationships of Venezuela’s partners.

https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/new-canadian-prime-minister-carney-will-run-in-ottawa-area-district-as-he-seeks-to-join-parliament-1868494,"TORONTO: New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will run in an Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament for the first time, two officials familiar with the matter said Saturday, a day before Carney triggers an early general election before a vote on April 28. The election will take place against the backdrop of a trade war and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Carney will run to represent the suburban Ottawa area of Nepean. The election campaign for 343 seats or districts in the House of Commons will last 37 days. The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister. Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader on March 9 following a leadership race by the governing party. Carney, sworn in as Canada’s 24th prime minister on March 14, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate. The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war. Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has upended Canadian politics. What Trump hasn’t said is that the almost daily attacks on Canada’s sovereignty have infuriated Canadians. That has led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers. The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump. Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. Carney still hasn’t had a phone call with Trump and that might not happen now until after the election. Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but he has not yet mentioned Carney’s name. Carney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013, he became the first noncitizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England — helping to manage the impact of Brexit. Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney’s main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada’s federal election this year until Trump’s near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them. Poilievre, 45, for years the party’s go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put “Canada first.” He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada’s public broadcaster. His party announced that it won’t allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes.",New Canadian Prime Minister Carney will run in Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament,AP,Deccan Chronicle,2025-03-23T02:39:14,2025-03-23T02:39:39,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.arabnews.com/node/2593636/middle-east,"MANAMA: Bahrain’s first domestically designed and developed satellite, Al-Munther, was launched successfully on Saturday. The project, spearheaded by the National Space Science Agency, marks a milestone for Bahrain’s space ambitions. The 3U CubeSat is the first satellite in the region to integrate artificial intelligence for onboard image processing. Mohammed Ibrahim Al-Aseeri, CEO of the National Space Science Agency, told Arab News: “The successful launch of Bahrain’s Al-Munther satellite into orbit marks a major milestone in the kingdom’s space journey. I take immense pride in the achievements of the National Space Science Agency team, who have successfully placed Al-Munther in orbit, paving the way for initial operations and in-orbit system testing.” Al-Aseeri said Al-Munther was a remarkable national accomplishment, entirely designed and developed by Bahraini talent. The NSSA team played a key role in innovating, designing and building its payloads, leaving their mark on the rapidly evolving global space industry. He added: “Designed and developed entirely by Bahrainis, Al-Munther is a significant national accomplishment. This success reflects our commitment to the royal vision of positioning Bahrain as a leader in space and supports national development, Bahrain’s Economic Vision 2030 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.” The satellite features an Earth observation camera, a cybersecurity system, and a unique broadcast function that will transmit Bahrain’s national anthem and a message from King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa. It will operate in a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 550 km and is expected to have a two-year lifespan. The launch took place onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Vandenberg Space Launch Complex in California. Reem Abdulla Senan, head of satellite communication operations, said: “One of the most significant achievements of the Al-Munther mission is the development of a Bahraini-operated software system to manage the satellite and its payloads. This not only advances the nationalization of space technologies but also strengthens Bahrain’s autonomy in satellite operations. The software enables the satellite to efficiently carry out its designated tasks, including data collection, processing and transmission to Earth.” She added the ground station established in Bahrain would play a critical role in overseeing Al-Munther’s operations. “The station allows us to manage the satellite with high precision, support future space missions and even receive data from other free satellites operating on the same frequencies,” she said. “The successful initial contact between the satellite and the ground station after launch will mark a pivotal moment — confirming the communication system is functioning as intended and initiating the structured commencement of scientific operations.” Al-Munther, which means “herald” or “messenger,” symbolizes Bahrain’s forward-looking vision and commitment to innovation. It highlights the kingdom’s dedication to building a sustainable space infrastructure, fostering research and development and inspiring future generations to pursue advancements in science and technology.",Bahrain successfully launches first locally developed satellite,Arab News,arabnews.com,2025-03-15T00:36:00,2025-03-15T00:36:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://abc7.com/post/3-suspected-fentanyl-traffickers-arrested-charged-55-million-drug-bust-downey/16008095/,"DOWNEY, Calif. (CNS) --Authorities announced the arrests of three suspected fentanyl traffickers and the seizure of 14 million lethal doses of the drug with an estimated street value of about $55 million, along with heroin and methamphetamine. ""To say that this investigation has saved thousands of lives is an understatement,"" Downey Police Chief Scott Lougher said at a news conference in downtown Los Angeles Tuesday, where he was joined by State Attorney General Rob Bonta and Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman. Priscilla Gomez, 43, of Torrance; her brother, Gustavo Omar Gomez, 47, of Huntington Park; and Carlos Manuel Mariscal, 38, of Huntington Park, are facing felony counts in connection with the investigation, according to Hochman. Bonta said investigators had ""reliable information"" that led them to Priscilla Gomez, whom he described as a ""courier"" who was stopped by Downey police in a traffic stop. ""She acknowledged the possession of some drugs and also a K-9 was activated at the stop,"" the attorney general said. Investigators subsequently served a search warrant at an apartment in Downey, Hochman said. Downey police found more than 50 pounds of fentanyl and nearly 12 pounds of opium in a car and in the apartment Jan. 22, according to the District Attorney's Office. The attorney general said investigators also saw ""indicia of a Mexican cartel."" ""Some cartels are known for certain decor symbols, insignias. They were present,"" Bonta said. The district attorney noted that the 50-pound seizure of fentanyl in one afternoon exceeded the total amount seized at the U.S.-Canada border in an entire year by seven pounds. ""This one seizure could have killed literally every resident in L.A. County by itself,"" Hochman said. Priscilla Gomez -- who is currently in federal custody -- is charged with three counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance and one count sale/transportation/offer to sell controlled substance. Her brother is charged with two counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance, while Mariscal is charged with two counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance and one count each of possession of a silencer and unlawful possession of ammunition prohibited by a prior conviction, Hochman said.

https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202503120011,"Taipei, March 12 (CNA) Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) told lawmakers on Wednesday that Taiwan's government ""does not have the capacity"" to spend 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) annually on national defense.

""It is impossible [for the government] to allocate more than NT$2 trillion (US$60.73 billion) for defense spending, given the current central government's budget scale,"" Cho said at the Legislature.

Taiwan's central government budgets for both 2024 and 2025 are nearly NT$3 trillion, with social welfare spending the largest expenditures.

The premier was responding to questions from Kuomintang legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi (傅崐萁) about how the government would react if the United States urged Taiwan to increase its defense budget to 10 percent of GDP.

Fu said 10 percent would be NT$2.68 trillion, based on a government 2025 GDP estimate of NT$26.88 trillion.

U.S. President Donald Trump had previously touched upon the issue during his presidential campaign, calling on Taiwan to raise its defense spending to as much as 10 percent.

The calls were renewed earlier this month by Trump's pick for undersecretary of defense for policy Elbridge Colby in a Senate hearing.

Trump ""has made the same demand [for defense budget increases] not only of Taiwan but also of many other countries,"" Cho said.

""Currently, the Republic of China (Taiwan's official name) does not have the capability to allocate a defense budget of NT$2.6 trillion,"" he said, adding that the budget would be determined based on the country's financial capacity and military needs.

Taiwan's Cabinet had earmarked NT$647 billion for defense spending in 2025, equal to 2.45 percent of GDP, some of which was later cut or frozen by the opposition-controlled Legislature.

President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) later pledged to propose a special budget to raise defense spending to over 3 percent of GDP, though that, too, would require legislative approval.

On Wednesday, Cho denied claims made by former legislator Kuo Cheng-liang (郭正亮) in a recent political talk show that Washington had urged Taipei to extend compulsory military service from the current one year to two.

There were no such discussions in the government or requests from the U.S., Cho said, stressing that ""the status quo remains unchanged.""",Raising Taiwan's defense spending to 10% of GDP 'impossible': Premier,Liu Kuan-ting and Teng Pei-ju,Focus Taiwan,2025-03-12T14:15:00,2025-03-12T14:15:00,gemini-2.0-flash
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/asia/iran-china-russia-joint-navy-drills-intl-hnk/index.html,"Warships from Iran, China and Russia kicked off their annual joint exercises in the Gulf of Oman on Monday, showing off their military ties as US President Donald Trump upends longstanding Western alliances. The “Security Belt-2025” drills, taking place near the Iranian port of Chabahar, is the fifth joint naval exercise Iran, China and Russia have held since 2019, according to Chinese state media. Analysts have long seen the drills as a demonstration of the growing partnership among the three authoritarian powers as they seek to counterbalance US influence and challenge the Western-led global order. But this year, the optics are even more pronounced as Trump disrupts the transatlantic alliance – a cornerstone of Western security for decades – by embracing Russia at the expense of Ukraine, and pushes Asian allies to pay more for US protection. Asked about the drills on Sunday, Trump said he is “not at all” concerned about the show of force by the three US adversaries. “We’re stronger than all of them. We have more power than all of them,” he told Fox News aboard Air Force One. Concerns have been mounting in Washington about the emerging strategic partnership among China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, which US lawmakers have described as an “axis of authoritarianism,” “axis of autocrats” and “axis of dictators.” The fear is that a shared animosity toward the US is increasingly driving these countries to work together – amplifying the threat that any one of them alone poses to Washington or its allies, not just in one region but perhaps in multiple parts of the world at the same time. At the same time, Trump has openly embraced Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a bid to end the war in Ukraine by talking directly to Moscow while leaving Kyiv and European allies on the sidelines. Russia and North Korea’s military relationship has strengthened considerably over the last year, with the two signing a mutual defense agreement and Pyongyang sending its troops to fight for Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine. The drills also come amid heightened tension between US and Iran. Since returning to the White House, Trump has restored what he calls his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in an attempt to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon – a move denounced by Tehran as “bullying” tactics. The Gulf of Oman is a crucial gateway connecting the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Hormuz, through which more than one-quarter of the world’s seaborne traded oil passes. The US maintains its own significant presence in the region via the Fifth Fleet which is based out of nearby Bahrain. Russia’s Defense Ministry said the joint naval exercises will involve 15 combat ships, support vessels and gunboats, as well as helicopters, according to state news agency TASS. “The Russian side is represented by the Rezky and Russian Hero Aldar Tsydenzhapov corvettes, and the Pechenega tanker of the Pacific Fleet,” the ministry is quoted as saying. China, meanwhile, deployed the Type 052D guided-missile destroyer Baotou and supply ship Gaoyouhu from a nearby naval escort task force to take part in the exercise, the Chinese Defense Ministry said in a statement. The drills, with an aim to “enhance military trust and strengthen practical cooperation,” will include simulated strikes on maritime targets, visit-board-search-seizure operations and search and rescue drills, the ministry added. Iran has sent a stealth missile corvette and a patrol ship, according to Iranian state media.","Iran, China and Russia kick off joint navy drills as Trump disrupts Western alliances",CNN,CNN,,,gemini-2.0-flash

President Donald Trump announced Monday the delay on tariffs against Mexico and Canada was over, and thus a 25% tax on most imports from the trade partners went into effect after midnight. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, said at a press conference Tuesday he would apply a 25% surcharge on energy exports to New York, Michigan and Minnesota and would consider restricting the electricity exports down the line if the tariffs persist. He repeatedly placed the blame solely at Trump's feet. ""A tariff on Canada is a tax on Americans,"" Ford said at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada convention Monday. ""I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I encourage every other province to do the same."" Ontario is Canada's second-largest energy producer, with most of its power coming from uranium. The province has interconnections with the provinces Manitoba and Quebec as well as three U.S. states: Michigan, Minnesota, and New York.

The tax would not begin immediately on Tuesday, a Ford representative told Bloomberg. Canada enacted retaliatory tariffs: Alcohol, internet imports impacted in Ontario Canada and the U.S. have enjoyed a mostly tariff-free relationship for decades. While most imports from Canada are now taxed at 25%, energy is taxed at 10%. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday Canada would respond with 25% tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of U.S. imports, effective immediately. That will escalate to another $86.2 billion worth of imports if Trump's tariffs are still in effect in three weeks. Ford said he supported Trudeau's tariffs Tuesday. He also announced he was removing American alcohol products from distribution and had canceled Ontario's contract with Elon Musk's satellite internet service Starlink. ""There's going to be unemployment, inflation is going to hit and it's going to hurt the American people,"" Ford said Tuesday.

https://bulgarianmilitary.com/2025/03/04/houthis-claim-another-mq-9-trophy-in-their-sky-high-standoff/,"On March 4, 2025, Yemenâ	ms Houthi rebels claimed to have shot down yet another U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone, an unmanned aerial vehicle valued at over $30 million, over the Hodeida district in western Yemen. According to a statement from the Houthi armed forces, their air defenses successfully targeted the drone while it was allegedly conducting hostile operations in Yemeni airspace. If confirmed, this incident would mark the 15th MQ-9 Reaper downed by the Iran-backed group since the onset of their intensified campaign in late 2023, a period that coincides with the escalation of regional tensions tied to the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. military has not yet responded to the latest claim, though officials have previously acknowledged some losses while disputing the total number of drones the Houthis assert they have destroyed. The incident, reported by Houthi-aligned media and circulating on social platforms, underscores the ongoing challenge the group poses to American aerial operations in the region. Yemeni military claims to have shot down another MQ-9 Reaper drone worth over $30 millionit would be the 15th Reaper shot down over Yemen. The MQ-9 Reaper, produced by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a cornerstone of the U.S. militaryâ	ms unmanned fleet, designed to fulfill a dual role of intelligence gathering and precision strikes. Introduced in 2007 as an evolution of the earlier MQ-1 Predator, the Reaper represents a significant leap in capability, blending advanced surveillance technology with lethal firepower. Measuring 36 feet in length with a wingspan of 66 feet, the drone is powered by a Honeywell TPE331-10 turboprop engine, enabling it to reach speeds of up to 240 miles per hour and maintain flight for as long as 24 hours, depending on its configuration and payload. Its operational ceiling reaches 50,000 feet, allowing it to loiter above targets at altitudes beyond the reach of many conventional air defense systems. This endurance and altitude make it an ideal platform for persistent surveillance over vast areas, a feature that has proven invaluable in conflict zones like Yemen, where the U.S. has long sought to monitor and counter extremist groups such as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite, the Reaper carries a multi-spectral targeting system that includes electro-optical and infrared cameras, capable of tracking targets day or night in all weather conditions. It also features synthetic aperture radar for mapping terrain and detecting movement, alongside signals intelligence equipment that can intercept communications. This array of sensors feeds real-time data to operators, often stationed thousands of miles away in facilities like Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, who control the drone via satellite link. On the offensive side, the Reaper can be armed with a variety of munitions, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and, in some configurations, GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions. With a payload capacity of approximately 3,850 pounds, it can carry up to 14 Hellfire missiles, a stark contrast to the Predatorâ	ms maximum of two. This combination of long endurance, high-altitude operation, and precision strike capability has made the MQ-9 a workhorse for the U.S. military and the Central Intelligence Agency, deployed extensively in counterterrorism missions across the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. Despite its technological prowess, the Reaper is not invulnerable, as the Houthis have repeatedly demonstrated. The groupâ	ms campaign against U.S. drones in Yemen has intensified since November 2023, when they began targeting American assets in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict, framing their actions as solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The first reported downing of an MQ-9 Reaper by the Houthis occurred earlier, in 2017 when the rebels claimed to have used a surface-to-air missile to destroy a drone over northern Yemen. Another followed in 2019, with the U.S. acknowledging the loss but offering few details. The pace of these incidents accelerated dramatically in 2023, beginning with a confirmed shootdown on November 8 over international waters off Yemenâ	ms coast, an event the Pentagon attributed to Houthi air defenses. In 2024, the losses mounted. On February 20, a Reaper was downed near Hodeida, followed by another on April 27 over Saada province, where Houthi footage showed wreckage bearing General Atomics markings. May saw two more incidents: one on May 17 in Marib province and another on May 29 in the same region, both accompanied by Houthi videos of debris. September proved particularly costly, with the U.S. acknowledging two Reapers lost on September 8 and September 18, the latter in Marib, though the Pentagon disputed the Houthisâ	 claim of a higher total. The campaign continued into late 2024 and early 2025. On November 8, 2024, videos emerged of a flaming aircraft crashing in al-Jawf province, which the Houthis identified as another Reaper, though the U.S. military described it only as an ongoing investigation. December 28, 2024, brought a confirmed downing over Al Bayda governorate, followed four days later, on January 1, 2025, by another in Marib, marking the 13th and 14th losses according to Houthi tallies. Each incident has been trumpeted by the group as evidence of their growing military prowess, often with footage of wreckage or missile launches released through their media channels. The U.S. response has typically been measured, confirming some losses while conducting retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets, including missile launchers and radar sites, as part of operations like Poseidon Archer. Yet the precise circumstances of many shootdowns remain murky, with the Pentagon occasionally attributing crashes to technical failures rather than enemy action, a claim the Houthis dismiss as propaganda. Speculation about the weapons responsible for these downings centers on the Houthisâ	 evolving air defense capabilities, bolstered by Iranian support. One likely candidate is the 358 missile, a loitering surface-to-air system first identified in Yemen in 2019. Developed by Iran, this missile combines features of a drone and a traditional missile, using a solid rocket booster for launch and a turbojet engine for sustained flight. With a range estimated at 100 kilometers and an altitude capability exceeding 10 kilometers, it is designed to engage low-flying or hovering targets like helicopters and drones. Its imaging infrared seeker and satellite navigation allow it to loiter in an area, waiting for a target to appear, making it a plausible threat to the Reaperâ	ms operational profile. The Houthis have also been linked to older Soviet-era systems, such as the SA-6 Gainful, inherited from pre-war Yemeni military stocks, though these are less suited to the Reaperâ	ms high-altitude flights. More advanced Iranian designs, like the Sayyad-2C or variants of the Taer series, could also be in play, offering ranges and guidance systems capable of challenging U.S. drones. While the Houthis claim some missiles areâ	clocally produced,â	texperts widely agree that their arsenal relies heavily on Tehranâ	ms technology and supply lines, despite Iranâ	ms denials and a U.N. arms embargo. The repeated downing of MQ-9 Reapers over Yemen raises uncomfortable questions about the droneâ	ms role in the region and the broader U.S. strategy there. At over $30 million apiece, the financial toll of these lossesâ	spotentially approaching half a billion dollars if the Houthi count holdsâ	adds up quickly, even for a military with a budget in the hundreds of billions. More troubling is the symbolic cost: each downed drone fuels Houthi propaganda and undermines the perception of American technological dominance. The Reaperâ	ms strengthsâ	its ability to linger over targets and deliver precise strikesâ	also expose its weaknesses, particularly its reliance on an unjammed satellite link and its lack of agility against increasingly sophisticated air defenses. As the Houthis refine their tactics and weaponry, possibly with Iranian guidance, the U.S. faces a dilemma. Escalating airstrikes risks further entanglement in Yemenâ	ms complex civil war while reducing drone deployments could cede valuable intelligence and strike capabilities. For now, the skies over Yemen remain a proving ground not just for the Reaperâ	ms resilience, but for the limits of American power projection in an era of persistent, asymmetric threats. The frequency of these incidents in recent months suggests that neither side is backing down, leaving open the question of how long this costly aerial chess game can continue without a decisive shift. *** Follow us everywhere and at any time.

https://www.latintimes.com/panama-canal-china-united-states-donald-trump-threats-port-deal-574615,"Panama is considering canceling its contract with Hutchison Ports PPC, a Hong Kong-based firm that President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have labeled a national security threat due to its expanding presence in the Panama Canal amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China. While no decision has been made, anonymous sources told Bloomberg that the government of Panama is weighing the possibility of canceling the contracts. President José Raúl Mulino has not yet commented on the matter. The development comes after Rubio's visit to Panama, where he told President Mulino that steps must be taken to curb China's ""unacceptable"" influence over the US-built canal. Even though the Panama Canal is run by an autonomous entity overseen by the Panamanian government, the U.S. government claims China exerts influence through a Hong Kong-based company that operates ports on both ends of the waterway. ""People will argue, well, that's not China; that's a company based in Hong Kong. Well, a company based in Hong Kong is the Government of China. You are not a company in China if the Chinese Government doesn't control you,"" Rubio said in an interview with conservative journalist Megyn Kelly. ""If there's a conflict and China tells them 'do everything you can to obstruct the canal so that the U.S. can't engage in trade and commerce, so that the U.S. military and naval fleet cannot get to the Indo-Pacific fast enough'—They would have to do it, and they would do it. And now we'd have a major problem on our hands,"" he added. During Rubio's visit, President Mulino announced that his government would withdraw from China's signature lending program, Belt and Road Initiative, which finances infrastructure across several continents. The Panamanian leader added that U.S. warships would be granted free passage through the canal, addressing a complaint by former President Donald Trump, who said the U.S. Navy was paying ""exorbitant"" rates to pass through. During his inauguration speech, Trump vowed to take back the Panama Canal. The president claimed that the U.S. has ""been treated very badly by this foolish gift that should have never been made,"" referring to an agreement with the Latin American country that would eventually lead to Panama retaining full control of the canal. He further claimed that ""China is controlling the Panama Canal"" and said, ""We're taking it back."" Trump has accused Panama of favoring China over the U.S. According to Bloomberg, about 75% of the cargo transiting through the Panama Canal goes to or from the US, making it the biggest beneficiary of the route.",Panama Considers Withdrawing from Port Deal with Hong Kong Firm After Trump's Canal Offensive,Carola Guerrero De León,Latin Times,2025-02-04T16:03:28,2025-02-04T16:03:28,gemini-2.0-flash

	The Egyptian minister and his Jordanian counterpart, Ayman al-Safady, reiterated Monday both states' rejection to the displacement of Palestinians. They equally asserted the salience of concerting regional and international efforts to ensure the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, as a first step on the pathway of establishing a Palestinian state on the borders of June 4, 1967 having as capital Eastern Jerusalem.

 



	The Egyptian minister met Sunday his Iraqi counterpart, Fouad Hussein, expressing support to Iraq's security and stability, and keenness on fully implementing bilateral projects, and trilateral projects with Jordan.

 



	The Egyptian and Iraqi ministers also conferred over the updates in Syria, so as Abdelatty underscored Egypt's support to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, launching an inclusive political process that would lead up to elections, and combating terrorism and extremism for Syria not to become a source of instability in the region.

 



	Minister Abdelatty met Monday his Yemeni counterpart, Shaea Mohsen al-Zandani, underlining Egypt's backing to the unity of Yemen, independence, territorial integrity and state institutions. The minister pointed out that Yemen's security and stability are essential to guarantee security in the Middle East and Red Sea.

 



	The Egyptian minister also expressed support to endeavors aimed at achieving a political solution to the rift in Yemen, as it will equally end the humanitarian suffering in the country. In a related context, Abdelatty shed light on the food and medical supplies Egypt has granted to Yemen, in addition to hosting large numbers of Yemenis providing them with basic services.

 



	The Egyptian minister met Palestinian Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohamed Mostafa to discuss hosting another conference - in partnership with the United Nations - on Gaza reconstruction. The two sides also exchanged views on updates in the enclave and ongoing Israeli violence in the West Bank.

 



 





	Minister Abdelatty stressed to his Tunisian counterpart, Mohamed Ali al-Nafty, the necessity of maintaining the regularity of holding meetings among joint specialized committees in order to preserve the recent growth of relations.

 





	Similarly, bilateral relations were the major topic in the meeting of the Egyptian minister and his Bahraini counterpart, Abdel Latif Bin Rashed al-Zayani, as the former stressed the importance of expanding cooperation in various fields, and coordination on regional issues.

 



	The meeting of Minister Abdelatty and his Mauritanian counterpart, Mohamed Salem Ould Merzoug, also focused on reinforcing collaboration in different sectors, so as the former expressed aspiration to convening a supreme joint committee to agree on certain plans, mainly concerning trade and economic aspects.

https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202503/01/content_WS67c3046cc6d0868f4e8f02fc.html,"BEIJING, March 1 -- China's national ""two sessions,"" a key political event shaping the country's policy direction, are set to convene in Beijing next week against the backdrop of a complex and challenging domestic and global environment. The annual session of the top political advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, will commence on Tuesday. The session of the top legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), will open on Wednesday. The Chinese premier, top legislator, top political advisor, chief justice, and top procurator will present work reports. Lawmakers will review the government's annual budget and development plan. They will deliberate an amendment to the law on deputies to the NPC and local people's congresses. On the sidelines of the event, ministers from various government departments will engage with the public through interviews and press conferences, clarifying policies and responding to pressing concerns. The ""two sessions"" serve as a critical window to observe China's development plan for the coming year. Decisions and policy announcements made here will not only affect the lives of 1.4 billion Chinese but also have an impact outside the country's borders. So, what can be expected from this year's ""two sessions""? GROWTH TARGET FOR 2025 Typically, the GDP growth target set in the government work report is one of the most closely watched figures. As China's economy shifts toward high-quality development, GDP is not the sole measure of the economy. But it remains an important indicator. In 2024, China achieved its growth target of around 5 percent, thanks in large part to a series of significant macroeconomic measures introduced to offset economic downturn pressure. GDP growth serves as a cornerstone metric with profound and wide-ranging significance. Despite the challenges China's economy has faced in recent years, it is projected to contribute about 30 percent of global economic growth in 2024, making it the largest source of growth for the world economy. INCREMENTAL POLICIES To achieve its growth target, China will roll out more targeted policies to stimulate economic activity. The government work report is expected to announce policy measures to ensure the goal is met. China has already signaled a shift in its macroeconomic stance. At the Central Economic Work Conference last December, policymakers pledged to roll out more proactive macro policies in 2025. Notably, they decided to adopt a ""moderately loose"" monetary policy, marking a significant departure from the ""prudent"" approach over the past 14 years. The meeting outlined nine key priorities, with boosting consumption at the forefront. This reflects China's emphasis on domestic demand as a top economic priority. In 2025, large-scale equipment upgrades and consumer goods trade-in programs are expected to be promoted with greater intensity and in a broader scope. According to Finance Minister Lan Fo'an, China in 2025 will actively use the room for a higher deficit, increase the issuance of local government special-purpose bonds, continue to issue ultra-long special treasury bonds, and increase transfer payments from the central government to local governments. The specifics of these plans will also be a key focus of this year's ""two sessions."" INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LEADERS, LEGISLATORS, ADVISORS During the ""two sessions,"" Chinese leaders, who are NPC deputies themselves, will interact with their fellow lawmakers at group deliberations. They will also interact with political advisors to discuss hotspot topics that matter most to state governance. These interactions serve as a window for observing how the central leadership stays informed about grassroots realities. This is a defining feature of Chinese democracy, often described in contemporary discourse as whole-process people's democracy. In recent years, President Xi Jinping, a deputy of Jiangsu Province's delegation to the 14th NPC, has typically participated in the delegation's deliberations. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, also attended the meetings of the NPC delegation of the armed forces and joined group discussions of political advisors from various sectors. During these interactions, Xi emphasized key priorities such as supporting the growth of the private sector and private enterprises, accelerating digital economy development, and advancing high-level opening-up -- all crucial to China's economic and social progress. FOREIGN POLICY The ""two sessions"" also shed light on China's foreign policy, as the foreign minister typically holds a press conference on the sidelines of the meetings. Last year, Foreign Minister Wang Yi answered 21 questions during a 90-minute press conference, with journalists from across the world participating. The foreign minister touched on various regional and international hotspot issues, such as the Ukraine crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He also expounded on China's foreign policies toward Russia, the United States, Europe, and Global South countries. During this year's ""two sessions,"" China's propositions on international relations are particularly noteworthy against the backdrop of a rapidly changing and turbulent global landscape. AI, INNOVATION Without a doubt, technological innovation will be a key focus during this year's ""two sessions,"" with the artificial intelligence (AI) industry very likely to take center stage. Over the past month, Chinese tech start-up DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the global AI industry and capital markets by introducing an open-source and popular chatbot. Domestically, companies such as Tencent, Baidu, and BYD have begun integrating DeepSeek into their products. Some local governments have also announced collaborations with the DeepSeek AI model to enhance public services, while others have organized training sessions to help officials and business professionals better understand the development and applications of DeepSeek and other AI technologies. In fact, AI has already emerged as one of the hottest topics at many of this year's provincial-level ""two sessions."" Many AI-related plans mentioned in provincial government work reports focus on building innovation platforms, promoting deeper industry integration, and improving policy frameworks. It's important to note that the rise of innovations like DeepSeek reflects China's commitment to taking the lead in technological advancements and its broader strategic focus on talent cultivation, innovation-friendly environment, business environment improvements, and the nurturing of non-public investments. These elements are expected to be underscored during the ""two sessions."" Additionally, the sessions provide a crucial platform for lawmakers and political advisors to offer suggestions and foster broad consensus on national development. Some of them are corporate executives and leading researchers. What AI-related proposals and suggestions they will present will be a major point of interest for China watchers.",Things to watch at China's 2025 'two sessions',Xinhua,www.gov.cn,2025-03-01T20:58:00,2025-03-01T20:58:00,gemini-2.0-flash

Un tercer vuelo con 242 migrantes venezolanos, el primero con mujeres y niños, llegó a Caracas este lunes en un avión de la aerolínea estatal de Venezuela procedente de México, tras las conversaciones entre el gobierno de Nicolás Maduro y la administración del presidente Donald Trump.
El ministro venezolano de Interior y Justicia, Diosdado Cabello, indicó que desconocen si el grupo fue enviado desde EEUU a territorio mexicano o si se encontraban ya allí.
Precisó que está conformado por 94 hombres, 74 mujeres y 74 menores de edad, entre ellos una adolescente de 16 años sin acompañante. Cabello especificó que muchos de los menores llegaron sin ""ningún tipo de identificación"" venezolana porque nacieron en el exterior ""y no han sido registrados"" en el país, aseguró.
Todos, agregó, serán sometidos a exámenes médicos y psicológicos. También recibirán los documentos de identidad que correspondan.
El funcionario subrayó que todavía quedan muchos niños solos en el exterior y que sólo trajeron a una menor de edad sin representantes porque su padre aseguró que la buscaría en el aeropuerto.
“Luego viene la revisión del expediente policial de cada uno de los adultos. Esto lo hacemos con una rigurosidad necesaria porque la primera información es que desde Estados Unidos venían delincuentes de todo tipo y cuando llegamos aquí la realidad no es esa, la realidad es que son una minoría”, dijo el ministro venezolano de Interior y Justicia antes de recibir a los recién llegados en el Aeropuerto Internacional Simón Bolívar.
Cabello insistió en que ninguno de los venezolanos que han regresado tiene vínculos con la banda criminal Tren de Aragua, que el gobierno del país suramericano asegura haber desmantelado.
De acuerdo con el ministro, es posible que esta semana llegue otro vuelo con repatriados.
El 10 de febrero, fue trasladado a Venezuela un primer grupo de 190 migrantes irregulares venezolanos deportados desde Estados Unidos.
El jueves de la semana pasada llegaron 177 migrantes venezolanos que estaban detenidos en la base naval de Guantánamo. En este caso, Cabello precisó que 8 de ellos están a la orden de la justicia por delitos “graves”, específicamente homicidio.
Los vuelos de repatriación reiniciaron 10 días después de un encuentro en Caracas entre el gobernante Nicolás Maduro y Richard Grenell, enviado especial del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump.
En esa reunión, según se anunció, Venezuela aceptó recibir a todos los inmigrantes irregulares venezolanos capturados en Estados Unidos.
Más de 7,7 millones de personas han salido de Venezuela buscando protección y una mejor vida, de acuerdo a datos de ACNUR.

https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-usmca-deal-tariff-deadline-monday-mananera-recap/,"United States President Donald Trump said Monday that his planned 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian exports to the U.S. “are going ahead on time, on schedule,” meaning the duties would take effect on March 4 at the conclusion of a one-month suspension.

“This is an abuse that took place for many, many years,” Trump said in justification of the decision to impose tariffs on the United States’ neighbors and North American trade partners.




“And I’m not even blaming the other countries that did this, I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen. I mean who can blame them if they made these great deals with the United States, took advantage of the United States on manufacturing, on just about everything,” he said at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Earlier on Monday, President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed confidence that Mexico would in fact reach an agreement with the United States to stave off Trump’s proposed tariffs for a second time.



At her morning press conference, Sheinbaum also spoke about the possibility of Mexico imposing additional tariffs on imports from countries with which it doesn’t have free trade agreements, most notably China.

‘If necessary,’ Sheinbaum will seek call with Trump

Trump has said he plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for three reasons:

Undocumented migrants have “poured into” the U.S. from Mexico and Canada.
Large quantities of drugs, including fentanyl, have entered the U.S. from its southern and northern neighbors.
The United States has large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada.
On Monday, Sheinbaum reiterated Mexico’s commitment to “helping the United States” solve the “humanitarian crisis” caused by illicit fentanyl in the U.S.



On actions to combat drug trafficking and other problems Mexico will need to reach “important agreements” with the United States this Friday, she said, noting that the tariffs are scheduled to take effect early next week.



“If it is necessary I will be seeking another telephone call with President Trump — whatever is needed to reach an agreement,” Sheinbaum said.

She noted that Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard traveled to Washington for tariff talks last week, and declared there is communication between Mexico and the United States “on all issues.”



“What we need is to close this agreement” to ward off the tariffs,” said Sheinbaum, who earlier this month achieved a one-month pause on the proposed duties after agreeing to deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to Mexico’s northern border.

“… I believe we’re in a position to do so,” she said.

Ebrard has said that the United States would be shooting itself in the foot if it imposes a 25% tariff on Mexican exports, asserting that 400,000 jobs would be lost in the U.S. and prices would rise for U.S. consumers.

He said earlier this month that 25% tariffs the United States intends to impose on all steel and aluminum imports are illogical and a “bad idea” with regard to Mexico, given that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Mexico on the trade of those metals. The steel and aluminum tariffs are scheduled to take effect on March 12.

USMCA the priority, says Sheinbaum, and therefore additional tariffs on China are an option 

Sheinbaum noted that an Economy Ministry team is still in Washington as Mexico seeks to reach a new deal to stop Trump’s proposed tariffs taking effect next week.

“What we’ve established — I’ve said it from the beginning — is that the relationship and trade agreement with the United States has to be prioritized,” she said.



“And we ask the United States to prioritize its trade agreement with Mexico and Canada,” Sheinbaum said.

She said that imposing tariffs on imports from countries with which Mexico doesn’t have free trade agreements, such as China, is an option.

“[Former] president López Obrador even did it, he put tariffs on countries with which we don’t have trade agreements,” said Sheinbaum, whose administration recently imposed tariffs on Chinese clothing and textiles.

“… With China, for example, we don’t have a trade agreement. … So it’s part of what this [Economy Ministry] group is working on,” she said, alluding to additional tariffs on Chinese exports to Mexico.

Bloomberg, citing “people familiar with the matter,” reported on Saturday that “the Trump administration told Mexican officials” including Minister Ebrard “that they should put their own duties on Chinese imports as part of their efforts to avoid tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.”

However, Sheinbaum said that the implementation of tariffs on Chinese exports to Mexico wasn’t a “condition” that had been set by the United States.



“The issue is to reach an agreement that allows us … to guarantee that there are no tariffs between our countries [and] that the trade agreement continues,” she said.

“… [We have to] give priority to this trade agreement and see how the three [USMCA] countries can strengthen ourselves compared to other regions of the world,” Sheinbaum said.

“… In that sense, we’re not suggesting [tariffs] in particular on China, but rather on those countries with which we don’t have trade agreements,” she said.

“It’s something that I even put forward in the conversation I had with the president of China at the G20 [Summit in Brazil]. Of course with China there is a cultural relationship, … and [a relationship spanning] many other issues. On the issue of trade I told [President Xi Jinping] that we have the trade agreement with the United States and that is one of our priorities,” Sheinbaum said.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/20/ai-economy-undersea-cables-international-data-infrastructure/,"The artificial intelligence-powered economy has a massive vulnerability: the ocean. The digital world is connected by subsea cables, a roughly 750,000-mile network that could circle the globe 30 times. Laid as deep as five miles below the surface, these cords make daily life—and the global marketplace—possible. While 80 percent of international trade by volume is transported on the sea’s surface, 95 percent of international data flows under it, including instant messages, an estimated $10 trillion in daily financial transactions, and countries’ national-security secrets. Meanwhile, power generated offshore, a growing share of global energy, is often transported via subsea cables. These two elements—data and power—are the foundations of the AI economy. But the subsea cables through which they flow face escalating dangers, and multiple incidents in the past few months have highlighted those risks. In November, a Chinese vessel reportedly dragged its anchor along the Baltic seabed for more than 100 miles, severing data cables between Sweden and Lithuania as well as between Finland and Germany. NATO ships had to intervene. A month later, a Russian oil tanker believed to be part of Moscow’s “ghost fleet” cut a cable carrying power between Finland and Estonia, only to be seized by Finnish authorities. The German foreign minister called these incidents a “wake-up call” for Europe. NATO has since established a new mission in the Baltic to protect undersea infrastructure. But the challenge is global and persistent—in a sign of the heightened tempo of such incidents, another undersea cable—located to the north of Taiwan, which is connected to the outside digital world through just 15 cables—was damaged in early January, potentially by a Chinese ship. Shortly after, two cables to the Taiwan-governed Matsu Islands disconnected due to what Taiwan’s Digital Affairs Ministry called “natural deterioration,” though backup microwave communications were activated to keep the islands’ 14,000 residents online. In some cases, disruptions are accidental. Backup systems can often limit the negative effects, as they did during the most recent Matsu incident. However, whatever their causes, the consequences of the approximately 150 cable-breaking incidents a year can often be severe, and include internet shutdowns, espionage, and costly repairs and delays. In one dire incident in 2008, the severing of two Mediterranean cables shut down internet access in 14 countries, including 100 percent of connections in the Maldives, and 82 percent in India. What makes today’s risks even more vexing than they were then are questions of scale and significance. One-off cable cuts are relatively straightforward to fix. But if cables are damaged at particularly sensitive times or places, or on a wider geographic scale, then that task is much more challenging. Meanwhile, subsea cables are growing even more necessary to daily life as artificial intelligence increases demands for global data transmission, including through overseas data centers connected to the global cable networks. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being invested in AI infrastructure every year. But that infrastructure is often connected through one of the thinnest, and potentially most vulnerable, physical networks on the planet. The individual fiber optic strands that, combined, make up the subsea cables through which world’s information flows are often barely thicker than a human hair. And that delicate infrastructure predates the digital age. The first undersea cables made trans-Atlantic telegraph communication possible in the 1850s, and through the technological revolutions since, they’ve connected telephones, modern telecommunications devices, and now the global AI infrastructure. In recent decades, three main players, analogous to national champions, have dominated the global subsea cable market: SubCom in the United States, NEC Corporation in Japan, and Alcatel Submarine Networks in France. As of 2021, these three companies held a 87 percent global market share. However, in recent years, China has disrupted the subsea cable ecosystem. Huawei Marine Networks was founded in 2008, and it soon became the fastest-growing subsea cable provider and the fourth-largest in the industry. From 2018 to 2022, HMN Tech, as it was renamed in the intervening years, supplied 18 percent of new cables based on total length. The company’s success followed the playbook of many Chinese technology champions, with subsidies from the Chinese government allowing it to submit lower bids on projects than free-market competitors. The latest, and perhaps most consequential, market shift in the industry is happening now: the proliferation of artificial intelligence. As data has become the foundation for both the digital economy and the emerging AI industry over the past decade, hyperscalers—or large computing and cloud services providers such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon—have become major players in the subsea cable market. Most cables are now built by consortiums of hyperscaler and telecommunication companies. As technology companies build up their cloud and AI capabilities and construct more data centers globally, they also invest in more subsea cables. Today, Google is a part or sole owner of roughly 33 cables. Even in a stable international environment, it would be impossible to separate subsea cables from geopolitics. There are always risks of sabotage or espionage and the need to adapt to national and international standards-setting. Every international cable project needs government approvals along its routes. But in a more competitive—even combative—period in global affairs, the subsea cable market has become a more contested arena. In 2023, FP columnist Elizabeth Braw argued that we are “entering the era of the undersea Iron Curtain.” The public debut of ChatGPT in late 2022 and the proliferation of AI-enabled tools since have brought this 20th-century division into a new period in the history of technology. Because of the rise of AI, these cables are more important than they were even two years ago. The contest over subsea cables entails old tools of statecraft, such as deterrence and incentives, deployed in new domains. And in recent years, that contest has played out in every major geopolitical theater, affecting global consumers and many of the world’s leading companies. In Europe, a Chinese-flagged ship is suspected of having damaged a Baltic subsea cable in October 2023, a year before the Baltic Sea sabotage that triggered a NATO response a few weeks ago. In another incident earlier in 2023, another Chinese-flagged vessel reportedly damaged the cables connecting Taiwan with its aforementioned outlying Matsu Islands, leaving them without internet for weeks. And the warning signs flashed even brighter in 2024. Early last year in the Middle East, three cables in the Red Sea—where 90 percent of Europe-Asia communication flows—were damaged when the anchor of a commercial ship sunk by Houthi missiles dragged along the ocean floor. And U.S. officials told CNN last fall that Russia is developing a deep sea-focused military unit, a capability that could give Moscow new tools for aggression and gray-zone operations and attacks that fall short of war. The United States’ concern about subsea cables is growing and bipartisan. In 2019, worried about China’s civil-military fusion, espionage, and cyberthreats, the first Trump administration sanctioned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. The Trump era’s State Department’s multilateral Clean Network initiative included a “Clean Cable” pillar “to ensure undersea cables connecting [the U.S.] to the global internet are not subverted for intelligence gathering by the [People’s Republic of China] at hyper scale.” In 2024, under the Biden administration, the State Department built on those initiatives released the “New York Joint Statement on the Security and Resilience of Undersea Cables,” a set of principles endorsed by 30 countries at the United Nations General Assembly. The United States is also a member of the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience, announced in 2023. As world powers vie for regional influence and partnerships, subsea cable infrastructure contracts have become commercial contests for spheres of geopolitical influence. In 2021, HMN Tech was pushed out of a project linking three Pacific islands, including the Federated States of Micronesia, which has a defense agreement with the United States. The project was scrapped and later replaced by the East Micronesia Cable project, jointly funded by the United States, Australia, and Japan. Meanwhile, Vietnam—which has five aging subsea cables—is upgrading its infrastructure, creating a new opening for international ties. U.S. officials and telecommunications companies have held multiple meetings with Vietnamese officials to dissuade them from using geopolitically problematic companies, with officials reportedly pointing out that the choice of infrastructure providers could make Vietnam more or less attractive for international investment. For many countries, physical connections to Chinese cables are viewed as vulnerabilities. The United States government in 2020 set up Team Telecom, an interagency group tasked with safeguarding United States telecommunications infrastructure and preventing direct cable connections between the U.S. and mainland China or Hong Kong. Team Telecom recommended that the Federal Communications Commission block the Hong Kong segment of four planned subsea cable routes. The project owners of these cables, both hyperscalers, switched their termination points to the Philippines and Taiwan, rather than Hong Kong, at an estimated cost of tens of millions of dollars. The contest over subsea cables isn’t just playing out in foreign ministries—it’s also altering how companies are governed and how the world is wired. Due in part to U.S. pressure, Huawei divested from Huawei Marine Networks in 2020, when the company rebranded to HMN Tech. More significantly than a change in name or structure, other companies have been squeezed out of projects since then. The SeaMeWe-6 cable, now under construction, will connect more than a dozen countries across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe. HMN Tech was poised to win the contract in 2020 with a bid that was approximately one-third lower than competitors’, but the United States offered five foreign telecom companies training grants worth a total of $3.8 million if they selected SubCom instead, while warning consortium members of potential sanctions against HMN Tech. SubCom ultimately won the SeaMeWe-6 contract, and Chinese companies left the consortium, to be replaced by enterprises from Malaysia and Indonesia. The results of such commercial and diplomatic maneuvering are clear: Chinese companies are losing ground in international markets. There are now only three new cables with connections in Hong Kong scheduled for 2025, and none after. For comparison, Singapore, historically a smaller market competitor than Hong Kong, has 26 subsea cables landing at three landing sites, with plans to double the number of sites by 2033. Under the sea as well as over it, the world is becoming more divided. The geography of subsea connections mirrors geopolitical divides. Rather than transiting the contested South China Sea, for example, Western consortiums now often pursue less direct avenues, such as through the Java Sea. They cover a greater distance at greater cost, but with less geopolitical risk. Guam, Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore may stand to benefit from new routes, especially as they become greater data center hubs. Meanwhile, China has increased its push for new subsea cable projects to the global south and parts of the world that are tied to its Digital Silk Road initiative, where Western interests hold less sway. A world divided into blocs by digital infrastructure may be more resilient, but security doesn’t come without trade-offs. At $40,000 to $60,000 per kilometer, cables are expensive to lay, and once they’re set and connected to facilities like data centers, they cannot be easily ripped out and replaced. Delayed, canceled, or rerouted subsea cables add uncertainty, complicating market dynamics. Longer cables laid over less efficient routes also mean more latency, as data must travel greater distances. And while casual internet users may not recognize slower speeds, quick data transfer time is critical across many industries—even milliseconds matter when it comes to executing financial transactions, let alone in military applications. In the competition over subsea cables, countries can work to increase the security of their infrastructure, but it’s not clear what victory looks like. When it comes to AI, the United States has aimed to keep and develop what former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan described as “as large a lead as possible,” especially in advanced logic and memory chips, with chip export controls and other measures in place to impede competitors’ progress. But despite the differences in products made by each enterprise, Chinese companies and the Chinese government have largely achieved self-reliance in subsea cables, with capabilities comparable to Western alternatives. That means that export controls alone can’t ensure Western advantage. While Beijing’s access to international markets has been curtailed, China possesses the technology and capabilities across the stack to manufacture all components of subsea cables at home. China also has a history of pouring heavy subsidies into the cable industry, a trend that carries across other industries from solar power to electric vehicles, and that gives it asymmetric advantages that distort markets. As a result, despite pressure, HMN Tech remains competitive, can offer lower prices, and is planning to build its own $500 million Europe-Middle East-Asia cable, a rival to the SeaMeWe-6 cable. China also has a strong foothold in cable maintenance and repair, which are critical and complex components of the infrastructure’s life cycle. The cable maintenance industry divides the ocean into zones, with certain repair ships designated to cover each. As a result, U.S.-owned cables may rely on Chinese repair ships in certain places, which could make them vulnerable to spyware, whatever their ownership. In one concerning incident, a Chinese repair company that worked on cables owned by U.S. hyperscalers appeared to hide its vessels’ locations near Taiwan and Indonesia, according to shipping data reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. This unusual and unexplained behavior raised alarm about what the vessel was doing and where it was doing it. And repairs are even more complicated and costly in conflict zones, such as during the clashes in the Red Sea last year. Even in the absence of conflict, competing claims to vital sea lanes can distort the subsea cable market. While the United States has exerted pressure to push Chinese companies out of certain projects, China has gone further, delaying or blocking permits for cables with U.S. involvement, including in the South China Sea. The rising risks to subsea cable networks are connected to crises above the surface. The Iranian-backed Houthi attacks on international shipping have damaged undersea cables in the Red Sea. Taiwan’s subsea connections are potential targets in coercion campaigns against the island. And even if Western Europe isn’t yet directly engaged in a military conflict with Moscow, its infrastructure is under threat by an expansionist Russia—and NATO is responding to that very real threat. Rather than wait for something to happen, there are proactive strategies to protect subsea cables and deter bad actors. Enhanced coordination in monitoring and management of the seas can help. Such measures may include increased patrols as well as potentially boarding and inspecting suspicious vessels, particularly in shallow areas with significant concentrations of cables. This approach could deter attacks and improve attribution when they do occur. Meanwhile, AI itself may solve some of subsea cables’ greatest vulnerabilities. The Wall Street Journal reports that AI-enabled underwater systems such as drones are already being used to identify and combat threats, even at the bottom of the ocean. Where such forward defenses don’t succeed and cable repairs need to be made, especially in contested waters, partners can protect repair ships in the short term and prevent and eliminate threats as they arise. Increased redundancy in sensitive areas, combined with more ex-China repair capacity, including expanding their fleets of cable-laying ships, could decrease downtimes and build on Washington’s Cable Security Program, which authorized and subsidized U.S. repair ships. Meanwhile, streamlined permitting processes could speed up repairs and build-outs, which once took under 12 months, but can now last for more than three years because of a complex regulatory environment that requires engagement with multiple levels of government, often with uncertain and competing priorities. An improved regulatory environment can also speed up innovation, which may help build more resilient, diversified cable networks. In the next few years, alternatives to subsea cables—such as satellites and other space-based systems such as satellites in low-earth orbit—have shown promise, though they currently have less capacity than subsea cable networks and are still vulnerable to natural and humanmade disasters. Still, such options, bolstered by a growing private-sector space industry, may provide new data transmission options and backups in certain sectors. Indeed, a NATO-funded project launched in July 2024 aims to reroute more internet traffic to space, in case of infrastructure disruptions on Earth. And when the two subsea cables connecting Taiwan with the Matsu Islands were disconnected in January, the backup microwave systems were activated almost instantly. Still, such measures currently provide only limited bandwidth. That may suffice for a country’s sparsely populated outlying islands, but it would likely fall short in urban areas or when it comes to high-volume, low-latency data centers. There is no comprehensive backup for the world’s subsea cable networks. But the seabed, like the surface, is not as peaceful as it once was. A lesson of the 2020s so far has been that when deterrence—whether by denial, punishment, or entanglement—fails in one domain, it can soon collapse elsewhere. That’s also true beneath the waves.",The AI Economy’s Massive Vulnerability,Jared Cohen,Foreign Policy,2025-02-20T06:00:00,2025-02-20T06:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash

The heavy rain Saturday evening has caused a levee there to break, and floodwaters are pouring into the surrounding area. Emergency officials are calling it a life-threatening situation. ""It’s worse than I have seen it before. It’s truly a life-threatening event,"" Rives Fire Chief Campbell Rice said. The small-town community of Rives, Tenn., looks more like a lake as rising floodwaters swallow lawns and cars Sunday afternoon. ""We had the saturated ground, and the rivers were all full. And just all of a sudden we were inundated with water,"" Rice said. Obion County Mayor Steve Carr issued a mandatory evacuation for people living in Rives due to the rising water and no electricity. ""If anybody tries to stay there, they are not going to have any electricity or heat, and we are about to have subfreezing temperatures moving in tonight, so it is going to be a very dangerous situation,"" he said. Mayor Carr, made the declaration in a post to his Facebook page, saying: According to a post on their X page, the National Weather Service in Memphis said the levee near Rives in Obion County had failed Sunday morning, resulting in ""rapid onset flooding of the town of Rives and surrounding areas."" Water rescues are now underway as emergency crews take boats door to door. The Millington Fire Department said it sent a water rescue team of six people and equipment to Rives, adding that additional water rescue teams from Collierville, Tipton County and Madison County had been dispatched as well. ""Fire administration was notified at 7:30 this morning of extensive flooding in the area, and the request for water teams was issued,"" the department wrote in a post to X. ""The teams have arrived in the area and have boats in the water conducting recon missions of flooded properties in that community."" ""We did have some folks that have gotten cold and wet, and they’ve been taken to the hospital for treatment, but we’ve had no serious injuries or deaths, so we are thankful for that,"" Carr said. As the county prepares to rebuild, more departments and people are stepping up to help. ""This is kind of what these guys do. They jump in and help other departments,"" Collierville Fire Chief John Selberg said. ""A lot of them are on their days off, and it's kind of nice because next time you’re going to be the one who needs it. So it is always nice to get out and help someone else."" They are closely monitoring the situation and stress the seriousness of the potential for further levee breakage, Mayor Carr said. Mayor Carr, in a separate statement on the situation, said: ""Dear Residents of Rives and Obion County, Today is a very sad day for our community and our hearts hurt for all those who are affected by the ongoing flood crisis.

In a statement issued under the name of its spokesperson, the Ministry of Unification said, “The government has confirmed that North Korea is dismantling the Mount Kumgang family reunion center, a facility symbolizing the long-cherished hopes of separated families for permanent reunions.” The ministry added, “We strongly regret that North Korea is tearing down the reunion facility, which was established through inter-Korean agreements, and sternly call for an immediate halt to such actions.” The ministry condemned the demolition, stating that “tearing down the Mount Kumgang family reunion center crushes the hopes of separated families and is a cruel act.” It also denounced the move as “a blatant violation of South Korea’s state assets.” Built under a bilateral agreement as a venue for inter-Korean reunions, the facility was constructed with an investment of approximately 55 billion won ($37.9 million) from South Korea. The 50,000-square-meter complex includes a 12-story main reunion building with one underground level, two three-story administrative office buildings, and a security post. The main building features a hall and meeting rooms that can accommodate 600 people, as well as convenience facilities on the first and second floors. The third and fourth floors house 78 hotel-style rooms, while the fifth through twelfth floors contain 128 condominium-style units, totaling 206 rooms with a maximum capacity of about 1,000 people. Discussions on constructing the reunion center began in 2002, but fluctuating inter-Korean relations delayed the groundbreaking by three years. After three years of construction, the facility was completed in 2008. North Korea’s decision to demolish the center aligns with leader Kim Jong-un’s directive to redefine inter-Korean ties as those between two hostile states. Following the abrupt end of the U.S.-North Korea summit in Hanoi in February 2019, where no agreement was reached, Kim ordered the removal of South Korean-built facilities at the Mount Kumgang tourist area, dismissing them as “shabby and unpleasant to look at.” Since then, Pyongyang has unilaterally dismantled South Korean assets in the area. In April 2023, North Korea demolished a fire station built with 2.2 billion won ($1.5 million) in South Korean government funds, leaving the family reunion center as the last remaining South Korean-built structure. The South Korean government said it is reviewing potential legal measures in response to North Korea’s actions and is considering working with the international community to address the issue.",S.

https://www.npr.org/2025/02/09/g-s1-47467/egypt-emergency-arab-summit,"TEL AVIV, Israel 		 Egypt announced Sunday it would host a summit of Arab leaders later in the month, amid alarm in the region over President Trump's proposals regarding the future of Gaza. A statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry says the summit is being called in response to a Palestinian request. It said the leaders will gather on Feb. 27 to discuss ""the new and dangerous developments in the Palestinian issue."" Also Sunday, Israeli forces began withdrawing from the Netzarim corridor in Gaza, in the latest stage of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The Netzarim corridor is a four mile strip of land bisecting northern and southern Gaza that Israel fortified during the war, using it as a military zone. Last month, as part of the ceasefire deal, Israel started allowing Palestinians to cross the Netzarim corridor and return to their homes in the North. The withdrawal is part of the six week first phase of the ceasefire, in which Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, while allowing aid to Gaza. In the next stage of the ceasefire, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and ""sustainable calm."" But negotiations are ongoing on the details. Israel wants Hamas' military and political capabilities eliminated, while Hamas wants all Israeli troops removed from Gaza. Egypt's announcement of a summit comes less than a week after many Arab states rejected Trump's recent comments about relocating Gaza's residents and creating a ""Riviera of the Middle East"" there, as have Palestinian leaders. Trump made the proposal Tuesday when he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington D.C. Speaking to reporters at the White House Friday, Trump said he viewed the proposal as ""a real estate transaction, where we'll be an investor in that part of the world."" He added that he was in ""no rush to do anything."" Several countries also condemned a suggestion by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — that Saudi Arabia has enough land for a Palestinian state. Netanyahu appeared to be joking in response to a slip by an Israeli TV interviewer, but his words reverberated through the region at a time when tensions are running high. Also on Sunday, there were emotional scenes in Bangkok airport, as five Thai workers who were released after being held hostage for over a year in Gaza arrived back home. ""We are all very grateful and very happy that we get to return to our homeland. We all would really like to thank you. I don't know what else to say,"" one of the Thai hostages, Pongsak Thaenna, told a news conference at the airport. The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' attack that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage, has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians according to local health authorities. In recent days, violence in the West Bank has intensified. On Sunday morning, the Palestinian Health Ministry said a 23-year-old Palestinian woman, who was eight months pregnant, was fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the Nur Shams urban refugee camp in northern occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said in a statement that it is investigating the incident.",Egypt to host Gaza summit as Israel withdraws troops from Netzarim Corridor,"Jerome Socolovsky, Robbie Griffiths",NPR,2025-02-09T06:13:44,2025-02-09T06:13:44,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.wired.com/story/2024-ransomware-payments-fall-chainalysis/,"For much of the past year, the trail of destruction and mayhem left behind by ransomware hackers was on full display. Digital extortion gangs paralyzed hundreds of US pharmacies and clinics through their attack on Change Healthcare, exploited security vulnerabilities in the customer accounts of cloud provider Snowflake to breach a string of high-profile targets, and extracted a record $75 million from a single victim. Yet beneath those headlines, the numbers tell a surprising story: Ransomware payments actually fell overall in 2024—and in the second half of the year dropped more precipitously than in any six-month period on record. Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis today released a portion of its annual crime report focused on tracking the ransomware industry, which found that ransomware victims’ extortion payments totaled $814 million in 2024, a drop of 35 percent compared to the record $1.25 billion that hackers extracted from ransomware victims the previous year. Breaking down the payments over the course of 2024 shows an even more positive trend: Hackers collected just $321 million from July through December compared to $492 million the previous half year, the biggest falloff in payments between two six-month periods that Chainalysis has ever seen. “The drastic reversal of the trends we were seeing in the first half of the year to the second was quite surprising,” says Jackie Burns Koven, who leads cyber threat intelligence at Chainalysis. She suggests that dropoff is likely due to law enforcement takedowns and disruptions, some of which had delayed effects that weren't immediately apparent in the first half of the year as ransomware victims and the cybersecurity industry grappled with catastrophic attacks. “Don't get me wrong: For everyone who's a defender or an incident responder, it's been a year,"" Burns Koven says. “But it is noteworthy that for the major attacks that occurred last year, those groups don't exist anymore or have been laying low. There's been a strong signal from law enforcement that if you cross the line, there's going to be consequences.” US and UK law enforcement scored two significant disruptions of major ransomware groups around the beginning of 2024: Six days before Christmas of 2023, the FBI announced that it had found vulnerabilities in the encryption software used by the group known as BlackCat or AlphV, distributed decryption keys to victims to foil the group’s extortion tactics, and taken down the dark-web sites the group had used to issue its threats. Two months later, in February of 2024, the UK’s National Crime Agency carried out an operation against the notorious ransomware group Lockbit, hijacking its infrastructure, seizing its cryptocurrency wallets, taking down its dark-web sites, and even obtaining information about its members and cybercriminal partners. Initially, however, both groups seemed to bounce back from those busts. AlphV in February announced that it had hacked Change Healthcare, disabling payments at hundreds of US clinics and pharmacies and extracting $22 million from the United Healthcare–owned company in one of the worst health-care-related ransomware incidents in history. Lockbit, too, seemed to shake off the NCA’s blows, immediately launching a new dark-web site where it continued to extort victims old and new. But in fact, both law enforcement operations may have been more successful than they appeared. AlphV, after receiving its $22 million ransom from Change Healthcare, pulled a so-called “exit scam,” taking the money and disappearing rather than sharing it with the hacker partners who had carried out the Change breach. Lockbit, too, largely fell off the map in the months that followed the NCA’s takedown, due perhaps to the cybercriminal underground’s distrust of the group and its alleged leader, Dmitry Khoroshev, when it became clear the NCA had identified him. In May of 2024, Khoroshev was also sanctioned by the US Treasury, making it far more legally complicated for Lockbit victims to pay a ransom to the group. While the vacuum left behind by those major players in the ransomware ecosystem was filled by newer groups during the second half of 2024, many of them didn’t have the skills or experience to go after targets as big and as well defended as Lockbit and AlphV had, says Burns Koven. The result, she says, was far smaller ransom payments, often in the tens of thousands of dollars rather than the millions or tens of millions. “Their talent is not quite as robust as their predecessors,“ Burns Koven says of the newer generation of ransomware gangs. “We're seeing the hangover of these law enforcement takedowns, not just directly targeting individuals and strains of malware but also the infrastructure and tools and services that had been used to help perpetuate these attacks.” Last year actually saw more ransomware incidents than the previous year, says Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst focused on ransomware at the security firm Recorded Future. The firm counted 4,634 attacks in 2024 versus 4,400 in 2023. But the lower ransom amounts received by those newer ransomware groups suggests they may have been favoring quantity over quality, he says. “What we're seeing in terms of payments is a reflection of newer threat actors being attracted by the amount of money that they see you can make in ransomware, trying to get into the game and not being very good at it,” Liska says. In addition to major law enforcement actions at the beginning of 2024, Chainalysis attributes the decline in payments during the second half of the year to heightened global awareness about the threat of ransomware, leading to more mature defenses and response plans within governments and other institutions. And Burns Koven adds that cryptocurrency regulation and law enforcement crackdowns on money laundering infrastructure, including mixers that help criminals anonymize and obfuscate the source of their ill-gotten cryptocurrencies, have also eroded ransomware actors’ abilities to handle payments without specialized knowledge. While the decline in payments during the second half of 2024 is significant for being the largest ever in Chainalysis’s data, the number of ransomware attacks and volume of payments has fluctuated and declined before. Notably, researchers saw a marked decrease in activity in 2022, a year in which Chainalysis placed total ransomware payments at $655 million compared to $1.07 billion in 2021 and nearly $1 billion in 2020. But while governments and defenders were initially heartened that their deterrence efforts were working, ransomware surged back as an even more dire threat in 2023, totaling, by Chainalysis’s count, $1.25 billion in payments that year. ""I think ebbs and flows are inevitable,"" says Brett Callow, a managing director at FTI Consulting and longtime ransomware researcher. ""If the baddies had a couple of brilliant quarters, a dip will follow, same as if the goodies had some good quarters. That's why we really need to analyze trends over a longer period, because increases and decreases over shorter periods don't really tell us much.” Additionally, researchers have long warned that it is difficult to get truly reliable numbers about the volume of ransomware attacks and an accurate total of payments each year. This is partly the result of attackers attempting to inflate their records and make themselves seem more effective and menacing by claiming old data breaches as new attacks or simply making up attacks that they haven’t actually carried out. And it is always difficult to get accurate numbers about ransomware (not to mention digital scams more broadly), because stigma and regulatory requirements often keep victims from coming forward. This makes ransomware forecasting more of an art than a science. ""My vibe from the second half of 2024 is that if there was a decrease, there will also be a rebound,"" Callow says. Chainalysis researchers are clear that the 2024 payment decline is not a guarantee of future reductions in ransomware attacks. But Burns Coven emphasizes that for defenders who are in the trenches on incident response, the data point is useful for making the case that sustained investment in ransomware defense is worthwhile. “We're still standing in the rubble, right? We can't go tell everyone, everything's great, we solved ransomware—they’re continuing to go after schools, after hospitals and critical infrastructure","Despite Catastrophic Hacks, Ransomware Payments Dropped Dramatically Last Year","Andy Greenberg, Lily Hay Newman",Wired,2025-02-05T08:00:00,2025-02-05T08:00:00,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/turkiye-open-to-hosting-palestinian-prisoners-freed-by-israel-fm-fidan-114035/,"Türkiye is willing to accept Palestinians released from Israeli prisons as part of the ongoing ceasefire agreement, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said during an official visit to Qatar. Speaking at a joint press conference with Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani in Doha, Fidan stated that Türkiye, along with other nations, is prepared to host freed Palestinian detainees if required under the terms of the agreement. “As part of the cease-fire agreement, one of the conditions involves ensuring that certain freed Palestinian prisoners do not remain in Palestinian territories. To support the agreement, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed that Türkiye is willing to host them, along with other countries,” Fidan said. He stressed that ensuring the implementation and continuation of the cease-fire is a priority, adding that other nations must also fulfill their commitments to maintain stability. Fidan reaffirmed Türkiye’s position against the forced displacement of Palestinians, stating that Ankara fully supports the Cairo Declaration, which calls for the protection of Palestinian rights and an end to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. “We oppose any plans to displace the Palestinian people from Gaza or force them to relocate to other countries. It is everyone’s duty to stand against such attempts,” Fidan said. “The ceasefire in Gaza must continue. Israel needs to move away from preventing the delivery of aid to Gaza. The international community must play its part. We are totally against the project of expelling the Palestinian people from Gaza and sending them to other countries. This is really a proposal against humanitarian law.” Fidan stated that everyone should stand against it. The Turkish foreign minister also addressed regional security concerns, stating that Türkiye is closely watching the new administration in Syria regarding its stance on the terrorist organization PKK/YPG. “We are closely following the new Syrian administration’s approach toward PKK/YPG and will not tolerate any situation where terrorism finds a foothold in Syria,” he said. Fidan underlined that Türkiye remains committed to preventing the presence and expansion of terrorist organizations in its southern borders and will take necessary measures to ensure regional stability. The Syrian people must take control of their own administration and transition process. As neighboring countries, we are in communication on how we can assist in this matter. Significant steps need to be taken regarding the reconstruction of the country and its urgent needs. We are working together to find immediate solutions to Syria’s pressing issues. The lifting of international sanctions is crucial. The unification of armed groups under a national army is important. The fight against terrorism is also a key issue. The Damascus administration continues its efforts to reach out to and find a solution regarding the YPG issue. As Türkiye, we are closely monitoring these developments. Our hope is that the issue can be resolved without bloodshed. However, we cannot tolerate terrorism taking root in Syria. Ensuring an uninterrupted ceasefire in Gaza is a priority for us. After the ceasefire, we have observed difficulties in delivering aid to the region. Israel must abandon its obstructive approach. As Türkiye, we have great sensitivity on this issue. We are making every effort to deliver aid in the best and fastest way possible. During Syria’s transition process, we are in close communication with both Syria and our regional partners. There was a need for a cabinet, and with the formation of a government, we believe major uncertainties will be eliminated. At the end of his speech, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan addressed recent issues with the United States in response to a question. “We have shared this issue with our American friends many times. At this point, the ideal outcome would be to clarify the real’security issue’ for the Americans. The core issue here is that the YPG is providing detention services for Daesh prisoners and managing the camp population. Other than this, there is no additional security concern.” Fidan stated that the YPG lacks independent capability in the fight against Daesh and terrorism, emphasizing that the group itself is a terrorist organization. “Türkiye, Iraq, Syria, and Jordan have the capability to combat Daesh together. We have already held preliminary discussions, and we hope to take concrete steps as four nations,” Fidan said. Fidan also expressed Ankara’s expectation that the United States will abandon policies that pose a threat to Türkiye’s security. “We hope that our American friends will abandon this policy, which threatens Türkiye. At the same time, we can work towards an alternative formula that ensures Daesh detainees remain in prison.” He also noted that the new administration in Syria has expressed readiness to take responsibility in this matter, while Türkiye is also prepared to provide full support. “We hope that with the decision of Mr. Trump, the ongoing mistake in the region will come to an end. This issue not only fuels instability in the region but is also an open wound damaging Türkiye-U.S. relations. We wish for this matter to be resolved.” During his visit, Fidan held discussions with Qatari officials regarding bilateral relations, the Gaza ceasefire, and broader Middle East security concerns. “Türkiye and Qatar have strategic relations and this relationship contributes greatly to the peace, security and prosperity of the region,” FM Fidan said. “We talked about what needs to be done for Syria’s urgent needs. Syria’s outstanding problems need an international solution,” he added. “The people have urgent problems that require solutions. As Türkiye and Qatar, we are working in close cooperation on what can be done. Certain projects have already been finalized, and our goal is to bring them to life,” Fidan concluded.",Türkiye open to hosting Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel:\u00a0FM\u00a0Fidan,Newsroom,Türkiye Today,2025-02-02T12:13:46,2025-02-04T10:33:56,gemini-2.0-flash

https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2952270/thai-officials-in-israel-to-bring-hostages-home,"Foreign Affairs Minister Maris Sangiampongsa arrived in Israel on Saturday to oversee the expected repatriation of five Thai nationals recently released after being held hostage by Hamas for 15 months. Mr Maris and Chief of Defence Forces Gen Songwit Noonpakdee arrived in Tel Aviv on Saturday morning local time and later visited the five Thais at Al-Shamir Medical Centre, where a Zoom conference was held with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. Ms Paetongtarn wrote later in a post on X that the government has assigned the Thai Embassy in Tel Aviv to follow up on the compensation the freed hostages will receive from both Israel and Thailand. She said compensation from the Israel National Insurance Institute would include 1,000 shekels a month (10,000 baht) until age 67, with additional sums paid yearly after that.

(Photo: @MFAThai X account) Mr Maris also met with his Israeli counterpart, Gideon Sa’ar, to discuss the process of repatriating the five Thais to Thailand. A military medical team currently in Israel played a key role in coordinating the men’s release and will continue working to facilitate their return as soon as possible. Before departing for Israel on Friday night, Mr Maris said that as far as he was aware, the hostages who were freed on Thursday were in good physical health. However, he noted that their prolonged captivity may have significantly impacted their mental health. “It will likely take eight to ten days for them to undergo thorough physical and mental health examinations, as well as an assessment to determine their fitness to fly home,” he said. “Of course, we want them to reunite with their families as soon as possible,” he added. “Being back with their loved ones should also aid in their mental recovery.” The minister expressed gratitude to Israel for its continued efforts in securing the release of the hostages, as well as to the Thai military team that worked for nearly a month to facilitate their freedom. He also extended Thailand’s appreciation to Qatar, Egypt, Iran, and Turkey for their assistance.

the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is discouraged amid ongoing violence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Wednesday.
Since Monday, violence has taken over the Congolese city of Goma following its seizure by the Rwanda-backed
rebel group M23, escalating an ongoing conflict. On Tuesday, several embassies in the Congolese capital Kinshasa were targeted by demonstrations against the events in Goma. The Belgium Embassy's gate was also
briefly set on fire.
Belgians in Goma are advised to leave the area by their own means if it is possible to do so safely or to remain in a safe place. Those in Bukavu are asked to reassess whether their presence is necessary, and if not to leave the area.
On Tuesday, Brussels Airlines cancelled two flights to and from Kinshasa. However, on Wednesday, it announced it would resume flights from Friday, with additional security measures. ""Our crews will not spend the night in Kinshasa in the coming period. Therefore, the return flight from Kinshasa to Brussels will make a technical stop in Yaoundé (Cameroon).""
Over 100 people have died and 1,000 have been injured following the recent violence in Goma, according to an AFP report on Tuesday evening.
More than 500,000 people are estimated to have been displaced since early January due to the fighting in Eastern DRC, the Congolese Foreign Affairs Minister said on Tuesday.

https://colombiareports.com/colombia-disallows-us-deportation-flights/,"Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro said Sunday that he made American deportation flights return, claiming that “the United States can’t treat Colombian migrants like criminals.” In a post on social media platform X, Petro decried the treatment of Colombian migrants and said “I disallow the entry of US planes carrying Colombian migrants into our territory.” “The US should establish a protocol for the dignified treatment of migrants before we receive them,” the president added. Petro later specified that he wouldn’t allow the use of military aircraft for deportations. A migrant is not a criminal and should be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves. That is why I sent back the US military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants. I cannot make migrants stay in a country that does not want them; but if that country returns them, it must be with dignity and respect for them and for our country. We will receive our nationals in civilian airplanes, without treating them as criminals. Colombia deserves respect. The US Government has licenses for eight civilian repatriation flights per week, Foreign Minister Luis Fernando Murillo said ahead of the inauguration of President Donald Trump earlier this month. The change of attitude in Bogota follows the release by the White House of images of allegedly undocumented migrants boarding a military aircraft. According to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the batch “is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world” about the migration policy of the far-right administration. The Trump administration did not immediately respond to Petro’s decision to suspend his government’s cooperation with the American plans to deport millions of undocumented migrants. Bogota previously protested British and German plans to demand visas of Colombian tourists on claims that they were used by people trying to migrate to Europe. @2008-2019 - Colombia Reports.
