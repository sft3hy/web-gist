                            Manhattan in toxic dust and debris, the number of people diagnosed with 9/11-related

                        <p class="body-graf">Since 2011, the main resource for people exposed to the fumes has been the
                            World Trade Center Health Program, which covers treatment for cancer, asthma and
                            post-traumatic stress disorder, among other health conditions. </p>

                                href="https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/ataglance.html" target="_blank">enrolled in the
                                program</a> as of December, 64% have at least one condition linked to 9/11. Cancer is
                            the most common, affecting more than 40,000 members. Some people join the program after an
                            illness has developed, while others join to receive annual screenings that could detect
                            illnesses in the future. </p>
                        <p class="body-graf">The program’s fate has seesawed over the past 10 weeks as the Trump
                            administration fired and rehired certain staffers, only to terminate them again last month,
                            according to lawyers and advocates for people with 9/11-related exposures. They added that
                            the staffing cuts have made it harder to enroll members or confirm that their treatment is
                            covered by federal funding. </p>
                        <p class="body-graf">“These cuts are going to potentially delay treatment, delay diagnosis and
                            early detection of their cancers, and it’s going to cost lives,” said Todd Cleckley, a nurse
                            medical specialist at Barasch &amp; McGarry, a law firm representing 9/11 responders and
                            survivors. </p>
                        <p class="body-graf">“The health program already operated on a very slim staffing margin,” he
                            added. “We’re only beginning to see what those negative impacts will be.” </p>

                            the World Trade Center Health Program, plus the program’s director, according to lawyers and
                            advocates. The director was reinstated on April 5 after <a

                        </p>
                        <p class="body-graf">The HHS layoffs were part of a massive restructuring that gutted the agency
                            responsible for the World Trade Center program, the National Institute for Occupational
                            Safety and Health (NIOSH). In addition to the 16 staffers, HHS terminated other institute
                            employees in charge of certifying that patients’ 9/11-related illnesses were eligible for
                            federal funding, lawyers and advocates said.</p>
                        <p class="body-graf">“They weren’t on the World Trade Center Program payroll, but they did
                            things that are essential to the program running,” said Benjamin Chevat, executive director
                            of 9/11 Health Watch, a nonprofit group that helps ensure people have access to the
                            program’s services.</p>
                        <p class="body-graf">Lawyers and advocates plan to visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday to ask
                            lawmakers to reinstate staffers. HHS did not respond to a request for comment. </p>

                            is vital, providing access to life-saving, time-sensitive treatment for every firefighter,
                            police officer, volunteer, and everyday New Yorkers who remember that day, and remember what
                            it took to rebuild the next morning.” </p>
                        <p class="body-graf">Before the staffing cuts, 9/11 responders and people who lived, worked or
                            attended school or day care in the disaster area could apply to join the program and
                            typically get accepted within a few weeks. But Chevat said no one has been enrolled since
                            April 1. The program <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/ataglance.html"
                                target="_blank">usually enrolls around 200 people per month</a>, on average.  </p>
                        <p class="body-graf">Michael Barasch, a partner at Barasch &amp; McGarry, said he’s still
                            submitting applications on behalf of his clients, but “they’re not hearing from the health
                            program, so we don’t know if or when they will ever get an appointment.” </p>
                        <p class="body-graf">Members of the program receive annual screenings at certified health
                            clinics, which are largely concentrated in the New York area. There, doctors evaluate people
                            for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/conditions.html" target="_blank">a host of mental and
                                physical illnesses</a> with known ties to 9/11. If a doctor determines there’s a link,
                            the clinic submits paperwork to federal employees, who must certify that the condition is
                            eligible for funding before patients can be treated at no cost. More than 8,200 cancer
                            diagnoses were certified last year.  </p>
                        <p class="body-graf">New certifications haven’t been issued since the start of April, shortly
                            after HHS announced it was dismantling NIOSH, Chevat said. </p>
                        <p class="body-graf">The delays could have dire consequences for people who were exposed to
                            toxic dust and debris, lawyers and advocates said. Many cancers — once identified — must be
                            treated right away.  </p>

                        <p class="body-graf">The collapse of the Twin Towers released cancer-causing chemicals such as
                            asbestos, benzene and dioxins that lingered in the air for days to weeks. A <a

                            imagine,” said Michael O’Connell, who assisted with search-and-rescue operations as an
                            early-career firefighter after 9/11. “We slept in it, we ate in it, we bled in it. We didn’t
                            leave it. We were in that zone for almost nine months.” </p>
                        <p class="body-graf">Roughly six years later, O’Connell was diagnosed with a rare inflammatory
                            disease called sarcoidosis that caused debilitating pain in his joints and skin. He received
                            treatment through the World Trade Center Health Program, which he credits for helping him
                            manage his symptoms. The idea that new members might not be able to enroll or receive
                            treatment is “deeply disturbing,” he said.</p>
                        <p class="body-graf">If the NIOSH staffers aren’t reinstated, lawyers and advocates said,
                            hospitals may not get reimbursed for chemotherapy or surgeries and eventually may stop
                            offering them to patients. Barasch said he has already received calls from clients worried
                            about whether they can continue to get chemo.  </p>

                            layoffs due to budgetary constraints, Barasch added. In December, Congress opted not to
                            include a long-term funding package for the program in a bipartisan spending deal. Several
                            lawmakers anticipate that the budget shortfall could force the program to <a
