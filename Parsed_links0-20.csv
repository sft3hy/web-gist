https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-iaea-zarif-tehran-c3a8afc699c670300b9521f1e2019ef7,"WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Former aides to Donald Trump are discussing plans for a second term that would focus on tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and an effort to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, according to a person familiar with the matter. The discussions highlight what a second Trump term might look like, a return to the economic policies of his first term, along with more aggressive measures to limit the power of the federal government. A second Trump term would seek to extend the 2017 tax cuts, which are due to expire in 2025, according to the person, who asked not to be identified. The 2017 tax cuts, which were the largest tax cuts in U.S. history, lowered corporate tax rates and individual income tax rates. Trump is also considering an across-the-board cut in income taxes, the person said. Trump is expected to make a decision on whether to run for president in 2024 later this year. The former president has repeatedly teased a run for the White House. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The effort to make the tax cuts permanent would likely be met with strong opposition from Democrats, who argue that the tax cuts have benefited the wealthy and have increased the national debt. A second Trump administration would also likely seek to roll back regulations enacted by the Biden administration. Trump aides are also discussing plans to overhaul the federal government and limit the power of federal agencies, the person said. A return to the economic policies of Trump's first term, including tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks, would likely be welcomed by many Republicans and business groups. However, Democrats and some economists have raised concerns that such policies could lead to increased deficits and inflation.

The police's special investigation team on Yoon's Dec. 3 martial law declaration searched the presidential office's secure phone server and the PSS office and residence, all in the central Seoul district of Yongsan, in the morning, police officials said.

https://www.riotimesonline.com/venezuela-keeps-oil-output-above-one-million-barrels-in-march-opec-reports/,"In early July, the first of the summer’s heat waves enveloped the Northern Hemisphere. From Phoenix to Seville, Spain, temperatures soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In some places, they remained above 100 degrees, even at night. More than a billion people were affected by extreme heat alerts. The heat waves were a stark reminder of a future that, for many, is already here.

Yet even as these extreme weather events become more frequent, and more dangerous, there is reason for hope. The world is getting better at adapting to the heat. In cities, the solutions are often quite practical: Planting more trees to create shade, painting roofs white to reflect sunlight, and opening public cooling centers for vulnerable populations.

The Times is committed to in-depth reporting about climate change. Here’s what you need to know.

But what is the best way to beat a heat wave? This question, and others, were considered at a recent conference in Singapore, called the Global Heat Resilience Forum. The forum brought together mayors, government officials, and climate scientists to discuss what’s working, what’s not, and how to improve the world’s response to extreme heat. Here are some of the key takeaways:

Cities need to designate a heat officer. Some cities, like Athens, Greece, and Freetown, Sierra Leone, have appointed a heat officer, whose job it is to coordinate a city’s response to extreme heat. Their responsibilities can include everything from planting trees to creating public awareness campaigns to expanding the availability of cooling centers.

Extreme heat is a social justice issue. Climate change disproportionately affects the poor and the elderly. Those who live in low-income communities are often forced to work outside, and they may not have access to air conditioning or cooling centers. Heat officers can advocate for these populations and help them gain access to resources.

Cooling centers should be plentiful and easily accessible. Cooling centers are often found in libraries, community centers, and other public facilities. They provide a place for people to escape the heat and can save lives. Some experts suggest that the centers should be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during heat waves.

Communicate early and often. Public health experts say it is crucial to communicate the dangers of extreme heat to the public. Cities can use public service announcements, social media, and other channels to get the word out. They can also work with local media to share information.

Heat waves are a global issue. The Global Heat Resilience Forum underscored the fact that extreme heat is a problem for every country in the world. And even though the solutions can be tailored to individual cities, the problems — and the response — are global.

The heat officer in Freetown, Sierra Leone, Mark Turay, said that the challenges of extreme heat were often viewed in the Global South as a matter of infrastructure and climate finance. “The question that we are now trying to solve,” he said, “is how do we get more money to build the climate resilience measures that we need?”",What It Takes to Beat a Global Heat Wave,David Gelles,The New York Times,2024-07-11T13:58:09-04:00,2024-07-11T14:19:24-04:00

Mcebisi Jonas is former deputy finance minister and also served as investment envoy in 2018. In 2016, he accused the government of Jacob Zuma, back then president of South Africa, of corruption, saying that the Gupta family had offered to bribe him for the position of finance minister. The move to appoint him as special envoy to the US comes as relations between Washington and Pretoria are at their lowest point in years. The situation rapidly deteriorated earlier this year when US president Donald Trump cut off US foreign assistance to South Africa. And in late March, South African ambassador to the US Ebrahim Rasool was declared a persona non grata and expelled from American territory over critical remarks he made on the subject of the Trump administration. In his statement announcing the appointment of the special US envoy, president Ramaphosa however noted that he remained ""committed to rebuilding and maintaining"" the relationship with Washington. ""Mr Jonas is entrusted with the responsibility to advance South Africa's diplomatic, trade and bilateral priorities"", noted the presidency.",South Africa appoints Mcebisi Jonas as special US envoy in bid to ease tensions,,Africanews,2025-04-15T02:13:40-04:00,2025-04-15T02:13:40-04:00

""The Oman talks are one of dozens of tasks for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"" the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said in his meeting withÂxa0a group of high-ranking officials from three branches of the Iranian government on Tuesday. The Leader of the Islamic Revolution also said thatÂxa0the country's issues must not be tied to the talks. ""We are neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic about these talks,""Âxa0Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said while referring to the first round of indirect negotiations between Tehran and Washington in Oman on Saturday. After all, it is a decision and a move that has been made and has been implemented well in the first steps, theÂxa0Leader noted. He continued, ""Of course, we are very pessimistic about the other side, but we are optimistic about our own abilities."" Recalling the mistakes made during the JCPOA agreement in 2015,Âxa0the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said, ""The mistake we made in the JCPOA should not be repeated."" ""During the JCPOA, we conditioned the country and made everything dependent on the progress of the negotiations,"" he said. ""Investors will not invest when they see that the country is dependent onÂxa0negotiation,"" he underlined. âx80x9cThe negotiations may or may not yield results. We are neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic about them. Of course, we are very skeptical of the other party, but confident in our own capabilities,âx80x9d the Leader said. âx80x9cThe removal of the sanctions is not in our hands, but neutralizing them is; there are many ways and [there is] great domestic capacity to do that. If this objective is achieved, the country will become impervious to sanctions,âx80x9d the Leader said. Ayatollah Khamenei said the first steps in the current talks with the United States have proceeded satisfactorily. He urged officials to continue the negotiations with similar care hereafter. The remarks came after Iran and the US held talks in the Omani capital last Saturday, with Oman's foreign minister functioning as the mediator, according to Press TV. The Islamic Republic has asserted that the talks were solely aimed at addressing the USâx80x99s illegal and unilateral sanctions against the country, and various aspects of the Iranian nuclear energy program, strongly rejecting speculation about the processâx80x99s involving other issues. The United States lifted some of the sanctions as per the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a historical 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers. Washington, however, returned the bans three years after conclusion of the deal, and even began piling up more coercive measures on the Islamic Republic. The US has termed the adversarial approach as âx80x9cmaximum pressure,âx80x9d which has also seen American officialsâx80x99 repeatedly threatening to use military force against the Iranian soil. The Islamic Republic has, meanwhile, underscored that any direct negotiations with the US were neither useful nor acceptable for Tehran as long as Washington retained its hostile policies.

https://on.ft.com/43PNevH,"Brussels is exploring legal options that would allow European companies to break long-term Russian gas contracts without paying hefty penalties to Moscow. The European Commission has been studying the contracts and the possibility of declaring force majeure, which would allow importers to exit their obligations without paying additional fees, said three officials with knowledge of the plan. ""If the whole idea is not paying Russia, then [paying compensation] would undermine the whole purpose,"" one EU official said. The move highlights the EU’s struggle to wean itself off Russian energy and deprive the Kremlin of revenues for its war in Ukraine. Moscow’s gas now makes up 11 per cent of the bloc’s supplies via pipeline, compared with almost two-fifths in 2022, but volumes of Russian liquefied natural gas have increased rapidly in the past three years. Commission lawyers are exploring legal options as part of a road map on how the bloc will rid itself of Russian fossil fuels by 2027. The plan comes at a critical time for the EU as it also tries to present an energy deal to the US to counter President Donald Trump’s tariff regime. The commission declined to comment. The US is the bloc’s biggest supplier of LNG and is seen as an obvious replacement for any further reduction in Russian fuel. The EU paid €21.9bn to Russia for oil and gas between February 2024 and February 2025, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Unlike Russian coal, gas has not been subject to an import ban, while the EU has prohibited 90 per cent of oil imports from Moscow. Imports of the country’s shipped gas increased about 60 per cent over the past three years, but total Russian gas exports to the bloc are still the lowest since 2022. The road map — originally meant to be published in March — has been delayed in part because of concerns that any ensuing legislation would be blocked by Hungary and Slovakia, which now account for most of the remaining piped gas still flowing into the EU. Hungary’s pro-Russia government has threatened that it would reject gas sanctions, which need unanimous approval from the EU’s 27 member states. The road map has also been pushed back because of early discussions over the future of the Nord Stream pipeline connecting Germany and Russia, which have been revived amid US efforts to find a rapprochement to end the Ukraine war, and the inclusion of gas purchases in trade talks with the Trump administration. “It’s a mess,” one EU diplomat said. “How does the US fit in all this? How do we diversify?” Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, however, told the Financial Times the plan should be published in “three to four weeks”. Despite pressure from Brussels, EU nations are wary of forcing companies to cut LNG contracts with Russia amid concerns that it will push up prices when companies are struggling with geopolitical turmoil and high costs. The commission gave member states powers to prevent Russian and Belarusian operators hooking up LNG to port infrastructure or sending their gas through EU pipes, but ministers have complained that this does not give them strong enough legal means to force companies to break their contracts. The complexity for the commission’s lawyers is that contracts are secret and tend to differ. Using the war in Ukraine to call force majeure may not be legally sufficient, one EU official said. France, Spain and Belgium’s ports are the main import hubs for Russian LNG. Moscow’s Yamal LNG plant still holds contracts with some of the EU’s biggest energy companies, including Shell and Naturgy. Brussels-based think-tank Bruegel this month argued in favour of tariffs rather than a full ban on Russian gas imports, noting that the former would generate revenue for the EU and force Russian suppliers to lower prices to remain competitive. Unlike sanctions, tariffs only require a majority of EU member states to back them in order to be approved. “An effective common tool on Russian gas imports is urgently needed — as otherwise Russia might again use (the prospect of) selective gas supplies to fuel profound discord among member states,” it wrote.",EU explores legal options for ending Russian gas deals,"Alice Hancock, Andy Bounds",Financial Times,2025-04-15T04:00:46.669Z,2025-04-15T19:53:59.000Z
https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202504/15/WS67fdb2cda3104d9fd381f49b.html,"HARBIN -- Police authorities in Harbin, in Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, said on Tuesday that they are pursuing three operatives affiliated with the US National Security Agency (NSA) over suspected cyberattacks against China. The Harbin public security bureau said that the three operatives -- Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson -- had been engaged in cyberattacks targeting the Asian Winter Games held in the city in February. Investigations by Chinese technical teams revealed that the cyberattacks were carried out by the Office of Tailored Access Operations of the NSA. To conceal the origins of its attacks and secure its cyber weapons, the office used multiple affiliated front organizations to purchase IP addresses from various countries and anonymously rented servers located in regions including Europe and Asia. Investigations revealed that the NSA focused its pre-event cyberattacks on critical systems of the Asian Winter Games, including registration, arrival/departure management, and competition entry platforms, authorities said. These systems, essential for pre-event operations, stored vast amounts of sensitive personal data of individuals associated with the Games. From Feb 3, coinciding with the first ice hockey match, NSA cyberattacks peaked, primarily targeting critical operational systems such as the event's official information platforms. These systems were vital for ensuring the smooth running of the Games, and the NSA attempted to disrupt them to undermine their normal operations. Meanwhile, the NSA launched cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in Heilongjiang province, including energy, transportation, water resources, telecommunications, and defense research institutions, authorities said. Technical teams also discovered that during the Asian Winter Games, the NSA transmitted unknown encrypted data packets to specific devices running Microsoft Windows operating systems within the province. These packets are suspected to have been attempts to activate or trigger pre-implanted backdoors in the Windows systems, authorities added. Further investigations revealed that the three NSA operatives had repeatedly launched cyberattacks against China's critical information infrastructure and participated in cyber operations targeting companies such as Huawei. Technical teams also uncovered evidence implicating the University of California and Virginia Tech in the coordinated cyber campaign against the Asian Winter Games, authorities stated.",Chinese police put 3 US operatives on wanted list over cyberattacks,Xinhua |,Chinadaily.com.cn,2025-04-15T09:13,2025-04-15T09:13
